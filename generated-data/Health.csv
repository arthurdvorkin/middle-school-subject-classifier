One of its main functions is to transport lymph, a fluid containing white blood cells, throughout the body to fight off infections and remove toxins. Lymph nodes, which are small bean-shaped structures found throughout the body, filter and trap harmful substances before they can reach the bloodstream. Additionally, the lymphatic system works closely with the circulatory system to return excess interstitial fluid back to the bloodstream, helping to prevent swelling and maintain proper tissue health."
