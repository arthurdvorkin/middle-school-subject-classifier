Social Studies,"you're gonna see me draw a really, really bad beaker here there we go . . . some little fumes coming off of that. and a lawyer, maybe I'll put a gavel here. It's a gavel, not a croquet mallet or a hammer. So first let's start with the storytelling aspect. I think one of the most important things that we can learn from telling this story of history is that in a good story nothing just happens. Imagine a story where everything just happened."
Social Studies,"The story would be: the wind blows, the earth turns, right? No one is making those things happen and that's why it's kind of a boring story because it doesn't show cause and effect."
Social Studies,"And that cause and effect is really the backbone of history, right? And you would be surprised how often people can fall into the trap of telling history, this incredible story about what people have done in the past that has led to the society we have today as if it were kind of a laundry list of events that just followed one after another without any possibility of things being different."
Social Studies,"People will say, ""and then World War II happened"" or ""and then the United States was born,"" right? Those statements are in passive voice because they don't talk about the people who make these things happen. And really, short of a natural disaster, pretty much everything happens in history because people made it happen. So when you think like a historian, you kind of think the same way that a novelist might think."
Social Studies,"OK, what is this character's motive? What are they going to do to make their wish come true? What are the influences that lead a person to make certain choices? And just like people make choices, nations make choices, right? World War I didn't just happen and just as people make choices, actions have consequences. You wouldn't write a story where a thief stole 100 million dollars and the police didn't even try to come after her."
Social Studies,"Neither can you write a story about history without talking about the effects that actions have on people. So that's the storytelling aspect of thinking like a historian. Let's talk about the scientific aspect. We often think of history as something that's pretty much done, right? It's a series of events that happened in the past and now we just have to memorize what happened so we can learn from it and maybe have a good idea about what to do in the future."
Social Studies,"But really there is only so much we can actually know about what happened in the past. And so historians always have to do a kind of research to understand what happened and get a better idea of what people were feeling. So just like scientists have theories, when historians think about the past, they're really thinking about theories as well."
Social Studies,"They're saying, ""ok, I have a theory about ""what caused the evolution of jazz in the 1920s."" Why did jazz become a major popular form of music in the 1920s? Well, I'm gonna theorize it was because people were reacting to the horror of World War I which made so many people interested in kind of, staccato notes and discordant sounds. Alright, so that's a theory."
Social Studies,"Well, how do you go about proving a theory? And the answer is you do research and you consult evidence, right? And the way that you do that in history is usually by doing a lot of reading, right? You might say, alright well, let me take the letters of some jazz musicians from this time period and see what they write about. Maybe they write all about how they experienced battle in World War I and they were trying to reflect that in their music."
Social Studies,"Or maybe they write that World War I had nothing to do with their interest in music. Actually, they wanted to simulate the sounds of flight because they were so interested in modern forms of transportation. So our understanding of what happened in the past is always just a theory."
Social Studies,"I mean we have a pretty good idea of what was going on most of the time, but new information comes to light all the time, right? I mean people are always cleaning out their grandma's attic and finding some new documents and as the preponderance of the evidence shifts and changes so might our understanding of the past. The last aspect of thinking like a historian I want to talk about is this kind of lawyerly aspect. And what I mean by this is that historians are always making an argument."
Social Studies,"Just like a lawyer gets up in a court room and says, ""Here's my idea, now let me support it ""with the evidence from witnesses, from experts, ""from objects we might have found at a crime scene."" A historian is saying, ""believe my theory. ""Believe my evidence."" And I think the analogy of law is really powerful here because you could see the same pieces of evidence used to support two different arguments. So for example, say there's, maybe . . ."
Social Studies,"a sock that was found at the scene of a crime right, and here's our sock . . . I'm not a beautiful artist. But, maybe the prosecution tries to argue . . . that the accused must have committed this crime because the sock is his size. Right, the sock shows he did it. Whereas the defense might say, ""My client never wears socks, ""he always wears sandals."" So it's clear that the sock shows that he couldn't possibly have been the one to do this crime."
Social Studies,"So that's how we end up with so many different interpretations of the same event. The task of the historian is to gather evidence and to present an argument that they think will best convince the public of their interpretation. And so these interpretations do change over time. So in later videos we'll get into the nuts and bolts of how you tell these stories and make these arguments. But for now, I just kind of want you to see that thinking like a historian is not something that only historians can do."
Social Studies,"It's actually a really useful skill for lots of aspects of your life. We tell stories, search for evidence, and make arguments in our lives all the time about things that we interact with every day like our favorite bands, our favorite foods, our political views, right? We base those on our own experiences, consequences in our lives and evidence that we see around us. And we can do the same thing for the past. It's not such a foreign country."
Social Studies,What we have are the remnants of that past and the ability to interpret them..
Social Studies,"And I think what's really important about looking at a speech like this is not only that we can learn to analyze this as a primary source, which will be helpful for thinking about it historically, but also because I think it's really useful to be able to look at a Presidential speech, or a speech given by any politician, and understand what kind of claims they're making and how they're making them."
Social Studies,"-  So, Kim, before we go any further, what even is a primary source? What's the difference between a primary and a secondary source? -  Great question. So a primary source is a document that takes a look at an event from the perspective of someone who was there. So, a primary source could be lots of things. It could be a photograph taken by someone who was, perhaps, attending a political rally."
Social Studies,"It could be a diary of, maybe, someone who was active in the women's rights movement in the 19th century. Certainly any speech, or even, let's say, like a oral history conversation, and I've mentioned a lot of significant things here, but it also doesn't even have to be something that is connected with a significant person or a famous event. It could be a shopping list, right, if you are studying the consumption habits of someone who lived in the 1950's."
Social Studies,"What they bought at the grocery store would tell you a lot about what they ate, what they could spend. So, a primary source is kind of the real meat of research material that shows you what people, at the time, were thinking. -  Okay, so a primary source is an artifact left behind by someone who was there. -  Exactly. -  What is a secondary source? -  So a secondary source is an interpretation. So, say I'm a historian, which I happen to be."
Social Studies,"-  Oh my goodness! (laughter) What a coincidence. (laughter) -  So I have done the work of digging up a bunch of primary sources, and, then, you look at all of them and see what they have in common, for example. So maybe I'm writing about Abraham Lincoln, and I get a lot of photographs of Lincoln, I get a lot of writings by Lincoln and his contemporaries and I go through all of them and I come up with my interpretation of what was going on in Lincoln's life."
Social Studies,"So, I write a book on Lincoln by Kim. -  Until now... (laughter) -  And that's my interpretation. -  Okay. -  Right? So the things that I'm interested in say Lincoln's religion, or lack thereof, might not be the same things that another historian would be interested. Say, they're interested in Lincoln's foreign policy."
Social Studies,"So, my interpretation is just one way of looking at those primary sources where another historian might have a completely different interpretation. What's also important about secondary sources is that I wasn't there, right? I never talked to Lincoln. He, you know, died more than 100 years before I was born, which means that you can only trust me so much. You can, instead, maybe get a much clearer picture of what Lincoln was really thinking by reading his own words."
Social Studies,"-  So, trust secondary sources about as far as you can throw them? -  Well, maybe trust all sources about as far as you can throw them, right, because everyone at every time has their own perspective. And so, the ideas of someone who lived in the 19th century are gonna be different than the ideas of someone who lives now, and you only know as much as you can know, right? You're only as informed as the information that you have."
Social Studies,"So, you really have to take everything with a grain of salt and compare it with other sources from its time period, and other sources later on, to get a sense of what's important. -  So you're saying that you might have a different perspective on Lincoln than another Lincoln scholar, but that Lincoln's writings, themselves, also contain Lincoln's own biases from his lifetime. -  Right."
Social Studies,"-  Okay, so what are we doing with Roosevelt's Inaugural Address, here? -  All right. So, let's take a look at this Inaugural Address as though we're historians, right? We're gonna sit down and really get into the... -  The feeling of the Great Depression? (laughter) All right. -  We're gonna get depressed. -  All right, I'm ready."
Social Studies,"So we've determined that because he was there and because this is a speech delivered by him, that this speech of Franklin Delano Roosevelt is a primary source. -  Right, and it's a great way to look at the Great Depression, right? If we want to know what people are thinking about, it's very important to see what the President of the United States has to say when he's been elected."
Social Studies,"So David, I know that you've been dying to read this in your terrific impression of Roosevelt, so I'm gonna turn it over to you to get a sense of what Roosevelt has to say. -  Okay, I'm gonna scoot back from the mike. ""I am certain that my fellow Americans expect ""that on my induction into the Presidency ""I will address them with a candor and a decision ""which the present situation of our people impel. ""This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, ""the whole truth, frankly and boldly."
Social Studies,"""Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions ""in our country today. ""This great Nation will endure as it has endured, ""will revive and will prosper. ""So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief ""that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - ""nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror ""which paralyzes needed efforts ""to convert retreat into advance."" -  That was beautiful (laughter). Thank you so much. -  You're welcome. -  All right."
Social Studies,"So how do we analyze this as a primary source and as a speech. And I think the first thing we want to do, step one if you will, is just identify what's going on, and thankfully, that's pretty easy for us, right now. -  Right, this is a speech given by the President of the United States in the moment that he becomes President. -  Right, so we know when it was, in March 4th, 1933. We know who gave this speech, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, just about to be inducted as President."
Social Studies,"We know why he gave it, right, very important for Presidents when they take office to make an Inaugural Address. So, we've got some basics here. We can even infer from the Inaugural Address where this was given, right, in Washington D.C. All right so in our identification, we've got that it's a speech, it's in D.C., happened in 1933, by FDR. So that's our identification stage. So to get at a little deeper level for this, let's move on to a second step which would be, kind of giving some context."
Social Studies,"So it's 1933. What's going on? -  Let's see. So, the Great Depression has been going on for four years. -  Uh-hmm. -  Prohibition has not ended yet, right? -  Right. -  Repeal has not come, so liquor is still illegal in the United States, for sale and transport. There's massive unemployment. The Dust Bowl is still raging. America is not in the greatest place! -  No, it's a depression, and it's a depression in all sorts of ways, right."
Social Studies,"People are emotionally depressed and there's an economic depression. All right, so we've got the general gist now that this is a speech from 1933 confronting the Great Depression. So let's get into a little bit more of the specifics. What is he actually talking about in this speech? -  Well, if you look at this speech, you can kind of see that he's acknowledging that things are bad. -  Right. -  Right. It's time to speak the truth."
Social Studies,"So he keeps talking about how, you know, ""It's time to speak the truth. ""We'll address the American people with candor. ""It is time to speak the truth, the whole truth, ""frankly and boldly."
Social Studies,"""We will not shrink from honestly facing conditions ""in the country today."" So Roosevelt is really priming everyone to say, ""Like okay, you have not been told the truth ""from your head of government for the longest time, ""and now it's time to deal frankly ""with just how bad things have gotten."" And what's interesting, is that he says, ""Things are not, you know, great, ""but in every dark hour of our National life ""a leadership of frankness and vigor has met ""with that understanding and support ""of the people themselves which is essential to victory."" And he's saying that there's no need to be afraid of anything except just malaise."
Social Studies,"He's saying that Americans need to meet the problem of the depression with like an up-welling of national will. -  Right, and I think, you know, it's nice that he's saying, ""Look, I'm gonna tell it like it is. ""Things are bad. ""I recognize that things are bad."" And that's pretty important, because up until this point, Herbert Hoover hadn't really done much to recognize that things were bad."
Social Studies,"You know, he saw that people were suffering, and, yet, he said this is not necessarily the responsibility of government to deal with this crisis. -  So Roosevelt, actually, calls it, ""a dark hour of our National life."" Right, like this is an acknowledging that things are not great is a big part of this speech."
Social Studies,"But he's also saying that it's possible for us to bounce back if we are honest about the problems, and we address it with vigor, and that is kind of the New Deal, right, is addressing the problems honestly and with national exuberance. -  Yeah, and I think this is such a fascinating speech because, for one thing, this phrase has kind of come into our national lexicon, right. ""There's nothing to fear but fear itself,"" which is kind of strange."
Social Studies,"It's one of those things, like ""Have your cake and eat it too."" That you're like, ""Wait how is that possible?"" So, what does he mean by, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" -  I think he's saying that this is no time to panic, and that the only thing that we should be afraid of is unreasoning terror. We shouldn't be running around like chickens with our heads cut off."
Social Studies,"Right, like this is the time to stand firm against nameless terror and focus on making the problems that we are facing into small, like accessible, combatable chunks. -  I think that another thing that's important about what he's saying there is that the Great Depression is caused by something that is very new in American culture, which is the stock market. And the stock market doesn't play by the rules of straight supply and demand. Instead, they play on confidence."
Social Studies,"And so, the reason that the stock market crash of 1929 happens is because people stopped having confidence that stocks are worth as much as the stock market says they are. So, everyone pulls out. There's a panic, and global banking pretty much collapses. And that's a really hard thing to deal with, right? I mean it's not like you're taking your money out of the bank or me taking my money out of the bank at any one time could cause an international depression. -  Right."
Social Studies,"-  But when there is a large group of people who all get panicked at the same time and take their money out of the banks, the banks fail. -  Right, and so what I think Roosevelt is saying is that we cannot allow a sweeping wave of panic to come over the nation again. -  Exactly. -  So, that's the context for this speech is things are bad."
Social Studies,"The reason things are bad is because of this wave of nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror, and ""America, I need your support ""to make sure we don't let that happen again, ""so we can turn this retreat into an advance."" -  In our next video, we'll go more into how we can analyze this source and use it to construct an argument of our own.."
Social Studies,"-  Let's get a little more into what else goes on in this speech, not just the very famous opening paragraph. We start here with saying people are facing the grim problem of existence, and a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment, and then what comes next? -  Let's hear all this in context. Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance."
Social Studies,"We are stricken by no plague of locusts, compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered, because they believed and were not afraid, we still have much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence."
Social Studies,"Having admitted their failure and abdicated, practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of man. Restoration calls however, not for changes in ethics alone. This nation asks for action and action now. What's interesting about this paragraph is that there's a lot of Bible stuff going on in here. There's a lot of biblical references that serve to do I think a lot of work for Roosevelt in this inaugural address."
Social Studies,"-  As you talked, I just underlined the things that really stood out to me as maybe kind of the heart of what he was saying, and you're saying these are like Biblical references. What do you mean by that? -  Some of them are."
Social Studies,"When we're talking about plague of locusts and money changers specifically, we're looking at old and new testament references respectively, in fact, later in this speech, he refers to money changers being chased out of our nation's temple which is a deliberate reference to the New Testament. -  This is very grand. We love to hear this speech so much, because it has that kind of ringing of authenticity in a way that maybe a modern speech does not."
Social Studies,"-  Some of that authenticity comes through association with ethic literature and the Bible. He's making these illusions to great Biblical events. Like the plague of locusts being visited upon Egypt which was like a great and terrible plague, and he's using that as a counter point to the misery of the present moment. He's saying, look, things could be worse. We could be ancient Egypt in the Bible, and locusts could be eating all of our crops."
Social Studies,"Things are bad, but it's not like God himself is willing destruction upon us. -  Yeah, I think this is also another one of the really interesting things about the great depression. It's true that there were farm failures during the dust bowl, but on the whole it's not like people stopped producing food. This wasn't a famine. What it was was a crisis of confidence where prices went down significantly, and so farmers could not make a living on their crops. It's not that they didn't have food."
Social Studies,"It's that they didn't have money, and I also feel like there's a different aspect to the reason that he uses this biblical language here, and I think that's because it's very authoritative. When you stand up in front of a group of people and Roosevelt has this powerful voice which really resonates with people, and you speak like a preacher would speak. It says, this is a man of authority. This is a man who perhaps is in touch with the moral authority associated with the Christian Bible."
Social Studies,"-  Sure, for a very long time, authority was kind of correlated with your ability to quote chapter and verse. I mean we're talking about a man who is just put his hand on a Bible in order to swear himself in. -  It really makes him seem not only like he knows what he's talking about, but also that he's got a handle on the situation."
Social Studies,"-  What we're saying that by harnessing the language, he's trying to harness the authority that people have invested in the church by using the language of the church. -  What we're doing here, I might call step three which is to identify how an argument is made. We're looking at his rhetorical strategies and seeing how they're effective or in perhaps another case, not effective in conveying his opinion, and I say opinion."
Social Studies,"At this point, what would we say that his opinion of the Great Depression is? -  That it's specific people's fault, that it is at the fault of not just this wave of panic, but on a count of some greedy people, the unscrupulous money changers and the rulers of the exchanges. He's blaming bankers for the great depression, which I think is fair. There's very little regulation in the 1920s that would prevent the kind of fraud that could lead to a collapse of banking."
Social Studies,"For example, insider trading is not illegal, and most people bought stocks on margin which is a terrible idea which means you only have to put 10% of the value of a bond down before you buy it, which means that there's a lot of theoretical money floating around out there that's not backed by much real money. -  That sounds like a terrible idea. -  It was a terrible idea. -  It's like buying stocks on credit. -  Exactly. -  Oh, man."
Social Studies,"-  His argument is that first, things could be worse. Second of all, the reason things are bad is because of these people. Thing number three, here's how we're going to get back on track. -  This is where we get here at the end. The nation asks for action, and action now, which it says not only a mention of how he's going to get things done but a covert poke at Herbert Hoover for not doing much, and then he says, our greatest primary task is to put people to work."
Social Studies,Remember there's an unemployment rate of 25%. -  That is so many people. -  Our current unemployment rate is less than 5% to give you an idea. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously.
Social Studies,"it can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources. -  This is a radical idea."
Social Studies,"-  It is a really radical idea, and this is one reason why historians love to study the great depression and the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, because this is kind of the decade where we threw out the rulebook, and I think what Roosevelt is saying here is he was willing to try anything to conquer the great depression, and one of the things he tries is bringing the government into the process of giving people work. We've got a sense of what he's arguing and how he's arguing it."
Social Studies,"Let's take a higher level look now. Let's say step four is seeing if you can analyze the potential bias of a source, and I wanna be clear that all sources are biased. I think a common misconception is that if you're looking at a source, it's either biased or it's not. It's written by someone who has an agenda or someone whose completely impartial, and that is never the case."
Social Studies,"-  What about a photograph? If I take a photograph of something or someone, isn't that then objective rendering of that person or object? -  It certainly shows what was there at that moment in time, but even photographers are making choices. When you pick up a camera and you take a picture of a thing, you are taking a picture of that thing and not something else, which in itself a form of bias to say I think this is important or this is what I want you to see."
Social Studies,"-  Where we put the frame is a choice. The question is what is Roosevelt not saying in this speech? What is he not taking a photograph of? What's just outside the view of his camera? -  And why is he taking this photograph of a speech? When he sat down to write this, what was motivating him? And what are some of the perhaps even less obvious factors about why he makes the argument that he does. -  Obviously, the man has a bias in favor of his own politics."
Social Studies,"These are his administrations, ideas. He's going to be coming out in favor of those very strongly. -  FDR is a democrat. There really haven't been many democrats in office since before the Lincoln administration since the 1860s. That's a new thing. This is the popular base rejecting Hoover and the Republican party because of the Great Depression. -  Right. -  He's bringing democratic political ideas to the table here."
Social Studies,"-  He's trying to make a case for those political ideas in this speech. He was elected by the majority of American voters, but now he has to make the case to the rest of the United States. He has to make a case to the people that didn't elect him."
Social Studies,"-  He's saying that direct recruiting by the government itself, government jobs, having the powers as if the depression were war, that is a case for really strong government intervention which is a key stone of the democratic party compared to Republicans who generally advocate for a smaller government. He's saying this is what's gonna work. The democratic platform of using the government in the economy and in social programs is what's going to work to get us out of this depression."
Social Studies,"-  He's making a big strong case for federalism. -  Exactly, what I think is interesting though here is that there's a lot he doesn't say, and I think that's also important to look at when you're analyzing a primary source. There's a lot that you could talk about, but you make choices about what to talk about and what not to mention. What could you say he doesn't mention here? -  He doesn't mention how any of this is going to work."
Social Studies,"-  Yeah, I think that's maybe the biggest missing piece here. This is broad strokes. This is getting people on board, but no where does he say, okay here's exactly what I'm going to do. Let me tell you how many dollars I'm going to spend, how many people I'm going to hire, what sort of cabinets I'm going to create. This is not a time for specifics he says. This is almost more of an inspirational speech to say okay, I gotcha. We've looked at the source."
Social Studies,"We've analyzed it's rhetorical strategies, and it's potential bias. The last thing we might wanna do with this is now think about how we could use it as a source. -  We're taking this primary source, and we're turning it into a secondary source. -  Right, so say that you are sitting down to write an essay about the Great Depression, and you've gotta say, now can I use Franklin Delano Roosevelt's inaugural address to make my point in my essay? Step five let's say synthesize perhaps."
Social Studies,"Using my big words, as a tool for your own argument. -  I would say that this speech is the frame that Roosevelt is putting on the depression. This is how he is creating the narrative that he wants Americans to adopt or he is identifying the crisis and this is how he wants people to see it. -  Yeah, so this might be a great primary source to tell you about Roosevelt's strategy or his communication strategy."
Social Studies,"What might it not be a very good primary source to help you make an agrument for? -  It probably wouldn't be a very good primary source for the Republican legislative response. You might wanna go with Senator Reid Smoot of Utah for something like that. -  Right, and it's probably not a great source for really diving into the specifics of the new deal. He doesn't say anything about the civilian conservation corp. He doesn't say anything about the national recovery administration."
Social Studies,"This is not the nuts and bolts of the new deal. It's the grand idea behind it. -  Right, he's trying to sell the new deal. -  It's I think, a really powerful primary source for understanding the impetus behind the new deal, but not the programs. -  Sweet. -  Alright, well thank you for bringing your sweet grammarian skills to the table as we look at Roosevelt's speech. -  My pleasure, thank you for bringing your sweet historian skills to the table."
Social Studies,-  Kim and David out. -  Scholarly high five!.
Social Studies,"So, these three phrases that I want to talk about are: ""Throughout history,"" ""It was inevitable,"" and ""And that's why [insert country here] is so great today."" So, why are these phrases so problematic? Let's start with ""Throughout history."" So, this is something that you frequently see in writing, from historical essays to pieces of journalism and it often has the ring of making something seem really strong and adding the weight of eons of history behind a single sentence. History is a very long thing."
Social Studies,"I mean, for recorded history we're going back maybe five thousand, seven thousand years. And think about the many different cultures and types of people and ideas that existed throughout that time period. If you're sitting down to write an essay about, let's say, The Cold War, and you start: ""Throughout history people have feared nuclear attack,"" well, the first thing your reader is going to think is: ""Wait! The nuclear bomb was only developed in 1945."
Social Studies,"I mean, that's not throughout history, that's only throughout the last seventy years."" Or what about: ""Throughout history people have gone to war over religion."" Your reader might think: ""Well, what about when people didn't live close enough to each other to go to war about different beliefs?"" And do we really want to send the message that having different religions mean that you necessarily have to go to war? One thing that ""Throughout history"" does is it makes an assumption about human nature, right?, that the way that people think now is the way that people have always thought throughout history, or the way that people behave now is the way that people have always behaved throughout history."
Social Studies,"And if there's anything that is one of the core beliefs of the study of history is that people are different over time. It's fun to study the past because people in the past weren't like us. They had different ideas, different beliefs, different cultural values. And so, if you want to be really strong about how you start a historical essay, always start it in a really specific part of time that you're talking about."
Social Studies,"So, if you're talking about the period from 1945 to 1965, say ""In the post-war era"" or ""In the late 19th century."" And you might also add ""In the United States."" Right? This shows that you have a strong grasp of both the time and the place that you're writing about. And so, you can make an argument that is specific to that time period. Okay, let's move on to ""It was inevitable."" I think we like to use the word inevitable because it's long and it sounds pretty cool."
Social Studies,"But think about what inevitable really means. It means ""It was unavoidable,"" there was no other thing that could have happened. Now think of a version of history where everything is inevitable. Everything was just going to happen no matter whether anyone did anything or not. That shows an interpretation of history that says that people's choices don't matter. And if you want to emphasize anything in history, it's how much choices matter. There are very few things that are inevitable in history."
Social Studies,"Most of them, I would say, are natural disasters, right? There is going to eventually be an earthquake in California is inevitable because there's a fault line. That's something that humans can't control, But for almost everything else in history, humans can control it. And they do decide how to react to certain situations. For example, take the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor, right? This is the event that leads to the United States going to war with Spain over Cuba in 1898."
Social Studies,"And the reason that this happened was because the USS Maine exploded in Havana Harbor. Now, we know and the Spanish suggested at the time that the reason that the USS Maine exploded was due to a spontaneous combustion on-board. There was an equipment malfunction. The United States chose to believe that this ship sinking was the result of a Spanish bomb and declared war. Now, you might have said: ""War was inevitable."" But it really wasn't."
Social Studies,"There were many ways that the United States could have chosen differently in that moment, to say: ""Maybe we will believe the Spanish and just leave it alone"" or ""Maybe we'll send some financial aid to Cuba but we don't have to go to war."" When you get rid of inevitability in history, you open up new choices, new ways that things could have gone. And that is really the heart of history, it's the possibility for things to be different than they were and different than they are."
Social Studies,"Okay, let's finish up with ""And that's why [insert country here] is so great today."" You see this all the time in historical papers. And I think writers are very tempted to finish a historical essay with some expression of patriotism. And maybe in a few rare cases this is true."
Social Studies,"You could say: ""The United States is a better place today than it was in the 1950s thanks to the Civil Rights Act of 1964."" But it's something you want to use very sparingly, because usually the scope of a historical paper - and think about our ""Throughout history"" here - isn't so huge as to merit the reaction to it being ""This is the heart of what makes America great today."" I've read historical papers about the Spanish Flu in 1919 that end with ""And that's why America is great today."" Ask yourself: is this relevant? And even if it is, is it the most relevant way that you could end an essay? For a historical essay you want to keep your conclusions very specific, the same way that you want to keep your period of time specific."
Social Studies,"So, if you're talking about the post-war era, conclude with something that you can actually substantiate, that you have substantiated in your essay, about the post-war era, say, ""The wealth generated by industrialization after World War II was the reason that the Baby Boom happened."" Don't say ""And that's why America is great today."" What do you mean by great? Do you mean economically great? Culturally Great? Politically great? It's a little too vague, and vagueness can really undermine your argument as opposed to supporting it."
Social Studies,"In a way these are all kind of appeals for human nature, appeals for the natural progress of history, and appeals to patriotism that are less rooted in the fact of what you want to say than they are rooted in ways of trying to get your reader sympathy. Instead what you can do is be specific in your time and your place. Emphasize choices and points where things might have gone differently than they did. And end with a conclusion that is very related to the things that you specifically addressed."
Social Studies,"Remember, you never want to introduce new information in your conclusion, and saying ""And that's why America is great today"" is new information, because it might not necessarily be related. Instead think about what it was you proved in this paper and key your conclusion directly to that.."
Social Studies,"Now there's recently been a scholarly debate about how people first arrived. We know that maybe 12,000 years ago, during an ice age, the sea level was lower, and so a spit of land in between the Americas and Asia was exposed, over which people may have traveled. But recent archeological evidence suggests that people were perhaps already in the Americas at the time of this ice age, so it's possible that they may have come earlier in boats."
Social Studies,"Now however it was that they arrived, they spread north and south and east throughout the Americas so that by the time that Europeans arrived in the late 1400s there were perhaps 50 million people. That's kind of a mid-range number for the estimates, that historians have made, living in the Americas. And of those, four to six million were living in North America."
Social Studies,"So how did these societies develop? Well, a really big moment was around 5000 BCE, when people in Mexico domesticated corn, maize, as it's also known. And domesticating maize meant that people who had originally been hunters, gatherers, following herds of animals could partake in settled agriculture. So they could develop villages, complex societies. This isn't to say that they stopped hunting or gathering, but they began staying in one place."
Social Studies,"So let's zoom in a little bit and take a look at some of the major societies in these regions. Native American societies developed around their natural environments, using the resources that were available to them. For example, the Southwest, Plains and Great Basin were quite dry. A lot of desert. And so societies in these regions adapted to the dry climate in several ways. For example, Native American groups that lived on the Great Plains continued their hunting and gathering way of life."
Social Studies,"Hunting bison, and following the herds of animals in teepees, which were dwellings that were easy to set up and then take down. People in the Southwest, like the Ancestral Puebloan people, dealt with this dry environment by creating very complex irrigation projects so that they could water their maize crops using what little moisture there was. The Puebloans lived in large cave complexes as agriculture allowed them to grow their population."
Social Studies,"In the Northwest, fishing in the Pacific Ocean gave Native Americans a plentiful source of food, while farming allowed the Mississippian peoples to develop large settlements, like Cahokia, near modern day St. Louis, which, at its peak, may have had as many as 25,000-40,000 residents."
Social Studies,"The Mississippians and other East Coast native peoples relied a lot on what's known as three-sister farming, in which people would plant  corn, beans and squash together, which was mutually beneficial to all three plants, as the corn served as a trellis for the beans, and the squash protected the root system of the corn. All three together create a very nutritious diet, which allowed for a relatively high population density on the East Coast."
Social Studies,"So by the time that Europeans began to arrive in the late 1400s and 1500s, native societies had been evolving for over 14,000 years. But the introduction of European people, pathogens, plants, and animals would introduce an unprecedented amount of change in the Americas.."
Social Studies,"Now they wouldn't have had anything like the level of this detail, but they certainly knew that there were very good things to be had in India, and China, and the Middle East. Excellent trade goods like silk and spices, and they knew there was quite a lot of world outside of Europe and Africa, but they didn't think that there was much out there."
Social Studies,"And they expected there would be some small islands on the range of Iceland perhaps, but they had no conception that there were two gigantic continents on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. It's a frequent misconception that people in this time period thought that the world was flat. Learned people of the era knew that the world was round. In fact they had known so since the time of the Greeks. What they did know was that the world was pretty large."
Social Studies,"In fact they correctly estimated that the circumference of the globe is about 25,000 miles. And so they knew that given the shipping technology that they had, it would be impossible to go west and arrive at the east, while still having enough food and water to supply your crew."
Social Studies,"Now why would anyone have dreamt of going west to get east when they could have simply gone east to get east? Well the answer is that the over land route was long and it was expensive because the Middle East and north Africa and even parts of Spain were controlled by Muslim empires like the Ottomans and the Moors. And so any time trade came from the east, China and India and the Middle East itself, it went through a series of traders and a series of empires along the way, picking up taxes and markups."
Social Studies,"Which meant that by the time a good reached western Europe it was pricey indeed. And since Muslim traders were in control of the Mediterranean here and at the east, taking a ship through there caused pretty much the same problem, so why not go around the coast of Africa? Well that was certainly something that Europeans were keen to do. The only problem is that the wind goes in the wrong direction and it's very treacherous sailing around the tip of Africa to come up into the Indian Ocean."
Social Studies,"So what changed? How did this over land trade route become an over sea trade route? Well for that we have to look a little bit closer at the Iberian peninsula. So this land mass here is the Iberian peninsula. And at the time, the Iberian peninsula was controlled by a number of different groups. The southern part was under Muslim control of the Moors, as they were called, or Moroccan Muslims and they called this area Al-Andalus and we're talking about this area here, and the Spanish called it Granada."
Social Studies,"The western part here was under the control of Portugal, as it is today. So we got Portugal. The eastern part, this area here, is the kingdom of Aragon and then a central part here was kingdom of Castile. So as far as Europeans were concerned this was kind of the end of the world. This was as far southwest as you could go on the European continent and heaven knows what was out here until in the early 1400s, Portugal's Prince Henry the Navigator began investing in navigation."
Social Studies,And one of the important discoveries made by the Portuguese was a new kind of ship and this ship was called the caravel. So what's cool about the caravel is that caravels are ocean worthy but they're also very easy to maneuver and they can sail into the wind.
Social Studies,"So, that means that the problems of sailing around Africa begin to get a little bit easier and so in this early era of the 1400s, the Portuguese began expanding their exploration farther and farther down the coast of Africa, and they come across these islands now that they don't have to hug the coast. The Canary Islands, and farther west this is so small you can barely see it here, Madeira and the Azores. And they quickly discover that these islands are ideal places to grow cash crops. Specifically sugar."
Social Studies,"They also discover that some of the people who live on these islands, in fact the Canary Islands had a native population called the Guanche. They immediately attempted to enslave these native people and then quickly discovered that they would die of disease. And we'll talk more about why native people seemed to be so susceptible to European diseases a little bit later. So now they have great places to grow sugar, but they don't have a workforce."
Social Studies,"Well they're discovering another workforce along the coast of Africa as they begin to set up, this is the Portuguese we're talking about here, trading posts on the west coast of Africa where they're purchasing slaves from African traders or Arab traders who had a long history of trading slaves from the interior of Africa out to its coast. So in the early 1400s, Portugal is doing very well for itself. Seems that they're leading this colonial game."
Social Studies,"They've pretty much invented the plantation system, and they're getting quite wealthy off of it."
Social Studies,"So the eyes of Europe turn to Portugal and they think all right how can we replicate their success? Meanwhile, back on the Iberian peninsula there's a political and religious shakeup, so the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon are united when Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile and I recognize that my Spanish pronunciation is terrible, they get married in 1469 and unite their two kingdoms into what becomes the kingdom of Spain. So what had been Castile and Aragon becomes Spain."
Social Studies,"And then united, these two Catholic monarchs turn their attentions to what's called the reconquista. So reconquering the territories that had been controlled by Muslims for Christians. Some call this kind of an extension of Crusader thinking, and Ferdinand and Isabella complete the reconquista, expelling the Moors from the territory that is today Spain in 1492. So now we've reached 1492 and we've got a will, that is a desire for luxury goods."
Social Studies,"We also have a little bit of good old fashioned nationalism here. Spain's closest neighbor is Portugal, who are currently very powerful and wealthy, so they've got perhaps some rivalry in their hearts, and we've got a way which is the caravel that is making more and more ocean sailing possible. And into this exciting moment steps Christopher Columbus, and we'll talk more about him in the next video.."
Social Studies,"He was born around 1451 we think in Genoa, which is today in Italy. And he had sailed quite a bit in his life. He was also a voracious reader thanks to the invention of the printing press back in 1450. And one book that he read with great interest was the account of Marco Polo and his travels in China."
Social Studies,"And Columbus dreamt of getting to China and there accessing riches, silk and spices, and maybe even converting people living in Asia to Christianity, and teaming up with them in a new crusade to expel Muslims from the Middle East. Now there are two common myths about Columbus that I'd like to dispel. One of these is that Columbus was the first European to discover the Americas. In fact we know that around 1000 CE the vikings of Norway had colonized Greenland and had explored around what is today Canada."
Social Studies,"So you might be asking, ""Okay, well if the vikings ""discovered America, why aren't we talking about ""the vikings in this video?"" And the short answer is the viking settlement in the Americas did not last very long, less than a generation. And it also didn't really get well known outside of Norway, so it didn't have the worldwide impact on colonization that Columbus's voyage would have. The other myth about Columbus is that he was the lone visionary who knew that the world was round."
Social Studies,Everybody else thought that the world was flat and Columbus proved them wrong. In fact most learned people had known that the world was round since the time of the ancient Greeks. What they thought instead was that the world was simply too big.
Social Studies,"They estimated that it was about 25,000 miles in circumference, which is pretty close to the truth, and that even if you could sail out here into the ocean, you would run out of supplies and die long before you ever hit land 'cause they had no idea that the Americas were over here. Columbus however had done some different calculations and he thought that the circumference of the world was only about 16 to 18,000 miles. So that the coast of Japan was about 3,000 miles to the west of Europe."
Social Studies,"Now he was wrong, but he got very lucky because about 3,000 miles to the west of Europe he encountered landfall. He just didn't know that what he found there wasn't China. So Columbus has this dream and he kind of shops it around the courts of Europe looking for royal patronage. And first he tries the Portuguese because they are the reigning leaders of navigation. And they turn him down saying his idea is too risky. He also tries France and England with similar results. Finally he tries Spain."
Social Studies,"And Ferdinand and Isabella agree that they will stake him. They give him three ships and a crew of 87 men. And in August of 1492 he takes off, makes a brief stop in the Canary Islands, and then turns west into open waters. And in October of 1492 he made landfall, and this is what he found. So he landed on the small island that he named San Salvador which is today in the Bahamas. And then he continued to explore around the coast of Cuba that he called Juana."
Social Studies,And then he ended up in the island that he called Hispianola which is today the island of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. And we'll talk more about who he met in the new world in the next video..
Social Studies,"This is a woodcut that depicts people in the region made a little bit later, so they may have looked something like this. And they were adept at fishing. We know that they were probably matrilineal, that is they traced their family lines through the women, not the men. We know that they were very generous people. Columbus repeatedly describes how people would really give you anything that you asked for We also know religiously that they worshiped ancestor spirits called Zemis."
Social Studies,"And this is a statue of one of those ancestor spirits that we still have today. Another thing I think is really cool about the Tainos is that we still use some of their words in everyday language that were borrowed by the Spanish and then came into English. So barbecue for example, they called barbacoa. Hurricanes, they called huracan. Tobacco was one of their words for the plant that will become so popular."
Social Studies,"Even the name of the island itself, they called it Ayiti, which is still preserved today in the nation of Haiti. So Columbus sailed around the Caribbean and then he made his way back to Europe. He left behind him 39 men whose ship had run aground so they built a fort and when he arrived in Europe, he immediately wrote a letter to the finance minister to Ferdinand and Isabella, Louis de Saint Angel. So let's look a little bit more closely at what he wrote."
Social Studies,"As I know you will be rejoiced at the glorious success that our Lord has given me and my voyage, I write this to tell you how in 33 days I sailed to the Indies with the fleet that the illustrious King and Queen, our Sovereigns, gave me, where I discovered a great many islands, inhabited by numberless people, and of all I have taken possession for their Highnesses by proclamation and display of the Royal Standard without opposition."
Social Studies,"To the first island I gave the name of San Salvador, in commemoration of his divine majesty. The second I named the island of Santa Maria de Concepcion, the third, Fernandina, the fourth, Isabella, the fifth, Juana, and I found it so extensive that I thought it might be the mainland, the province of Cathay. This is really interesting because you can tell a lot about what Columbus is thinking here."
Social Studies,"First he says that he's taken possession of these islands by proclamation and display of the royal standard without opposition. And I love this image of Columbus, he's reading in Spanish the proclamation, I claim this land in the name of Spain, and he's not opposed because the Tainos have no idea what he's saying."
Social Studies,"We can also see his religious motivations here as he names the first islands after San Salvador, the savior, Jesus, Santa Maria de Concepcion, the Virgin Mary, and that he's trying to win some points with Ferdinand and Isabella by naming islands after them. We can also see here that Columbus thinks that he's found China, he says. He thought it might be the mainland, the province of Cathay, and Cathay is an old word meaning China."
Social Studies,"So let's read on, he says, I began fortifications there which should be completed by this time, and I have left in it men enough to hold it, with arms, artillery, and provisions for more than a year, and a boat with a master seaman skilled in the arts necessary to make others."
Social Studies,"I am so friendly with the king of that country that he was proud to call me his brother and hold me as such, Even should he change his mind and wish to quarrel, neither he nor his subjects know what arms are, nor wear clothes, as I have said. They're the most timid people in the world so that only the men remaining there could destroy the whole region. So he's kind of saying that we're getting along with the natives, but if we don't, they're not a threat."
Social Studies,"And he finishes by saying, to speak, in conclusion, only of what has been done during this hurried voyage, their Highnesses will see that I can give them as much gold as they desire, if they will give me a little assistance, spices, cotton, as much as their Highnesses may command to be shipped, and as many slaves as the choose to send for, all heathens. So Columbus is finishing by saying, well this exploratory voyage has shown that we can get a lot out of colonizing this area."
Social Studies,"We can get gold, spices, cottons, slaves, and so if you'll give me a little assistance, that is, give me more resources to continue my mission, Spain will get very wealthy indeed from this new land. And that is exactly what Ferdinand and Isabella do. So they send him on a second voyage in 1493. And this time they send him with 1200 men and 17 ships, and they bring with them livestock, horses, cattle, pigs, and sugar cane plants so they can turn this into a plantation."
Social Studies,"So they really intend to use this settlement as not only a place to try out growing crops and also mining for gold, they also see it as kind of a jumping off place that they can use for further exploration in this area. Because the Portuguese were so dominant in this early phase of colonialism, the Spanish are nervous that the Portuguese are going to try to make inroads into their new acquisitions in the west."
Social Studies,"So with the help of the pope, they negotiate what's called the Treaty of Tordesillas, dividing the world between them. So east of this line here, this will be Portugal's area of the world. And west of this line will be Spain's. Remember that Portugal had lots of interests in Africa which they thought were much more valuable at this time."
Social Studies,"But it was later discovered that part of South America fell on Portugal's side of the line, and you'll recognize that as being today, Brazil, which became a Portuguese colony and even today speaks Portuguese. Now of course, they didn't ask anybody else's permission to divide the world between them."
Social Studies,"They didn't ask the native people of the Americas, they didn't ask anybody else in Europe, but it's important to understand that Spain thought of this area as their sovereign territory and from this point forward, Spain will continue to send what are called conquistadors, conquerors, to this region, Mexico and Florida, and South America, and from all of this they will become very wealthy as a nation."
Social Studies,"So I just wanna finish by contrasting how Columbus' voyage affected the native people of the Caribbean with how it affected Europe. So Columbus was not very nice to the natives, in fact. He originally attempted to enslave the native people, and send them back to Europe for sale to continue to underwrite his ventures. But they were susceptible to European diseases and quickly died. So he had to take another tack and that was by forcing the native people to labor for the Spanish, particularly to mine gold."
Social Studies,"And not long after Columbus returned, he put a quota for all people over the age of 14 that they had to give him a certain amount of gold per month or they would have their hands chopped off. And this is an engraving of what the Spanish were imagined to have been like in the New World. You can say that they're feeding children to dogs here. They were not quite as bad as this, but they were still pretty bad."
Social Studies,"Historians estimate that there were about one to three million Tainos living in the Caribbean when the Spanish arrived. By 100 years later, there were 200 left. Not 200 thousand, 200. And mostly this was due to disease, and we'll talk more in the next video about why native people seemed to be so susceptible to European diseases, but it was also due to overwork and poor treatment."
Social Studies,"They were forced to mine when they should have been growing crops and many of them were murdered by the Spanish for one reason or another. So for the people of the Caribbean, Columbus' arrival was really a catastrophe. In Europe however, the New World made Spain very rich. And the gold and silver being brought in from the New World to Spain may actually have increased prices in the one hundred years following Columbus' voyage by 500 to 600% due to inflation thanks to gold from the New World."
Social Studies,"Some historians even think that the influx of all this new wealth led to the creation of the modern banking system to deal with it and could even have been the forbearer of capitalism. So Columbus' voyage really opened up a whole new world, not just to the people in the Americas, but also to the people in Europe. He started a process, the Columbian exchange, and we'll talk more about that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"And some of these exchanges of species were intentional, like bringing new crops to grow in environments that were suited to them, and some of them were unintentional, like the microbes and pests, which were like little hitchhikers on the bodies and crops that Europeans brought to the New World. And it had a tremendous environmental affect that had real consequences for people on both sides of the Atlantic."
Social Studies,"So let's look a little bit closer at some of the things that were exchanged across the Atlantic after Columbus began the process of bringing things from the Old World to the New World, and from the New World to the Old World. So first let's take a closer look at the plants. Now, Spain, much like Portugal, was hoping to use this tropical landscape to grow cash crops. So Columbus brought with him sugar and grapes for wine, and coffee, these were all crops that would fetch high prices in Europe."
Social Studies,"It was so lucrative to grow sugar in the Caribbean that they didn't even want to give up any space to grow food, they imported their food so that they could spend all of their land growing sugar. The Europeans also brought New World crops back to the Old World, and some of these it's almost impossible to imagine a world before, for example, the tomato had ever come to Europe. Can you imagine Italian food with no tomato sauce? They also brought corn and potatoes and sweet potatoes and cassava, or manioc."
Social Studies,"And what's important about most of these crops is that they're very calorically dense. So if you grew a field of potatoes, instead of a field of wheat, which might be a typical crop grown in the Old Word before contact, you can feed three times as many people with a field of potatoes than you can with wheat. So what does this cause? It causes a real increase in population in Europe."
Social Studies,"It also causes an increase in population in Africa, where manioc is a crop that was frequently grown and also very calorically dense. So New World foods helped Europe and Africa increase their populations. So what about these animals? The Europeans brought cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses to the New World, with mixed results."
Social Studies,"Horses, for example, were a tremendous technology that was widely adopted throughout Mexico and the Native Americans living in the Great Plains of what is today the United States found that horses revolutionized their ability to hunt. So that was a great step up for them. The pigs they brought over, however, weren't so great because Europeans allowed the pigs to roam freely, which meant that they ate everything, including the Native Americans' crops, and they multiplied very quickly."
Social Studies,"So they became kind of a pest in the New World. Probably the thing that had the biggest affect in the Columbian Exchange was the transfer of Old World diseases to the New World. With Europeans came smallpox, measles, whooping cough, and the Native Americans had very little immunity to these diseases. It's estimated that within 100 years of Columbus landing in Hispaniola, 90% of all people who were living in the Americas died of disease."
Social Studies,"This is a demographic catastrophe the likes of which the world has never seen before or since. And most of the Native Americans who were affected by these diseases would never have actually interacted with a European, they just had trade networks that spread these diseases back and forth throughout the Americas."
Social Studies,"Now, you might be wondering, okay, so if the Native Americans were being exposed to new diseases from the Europeans, weren't the Europeans also being exposed to new diseases from the Native Americans? Why didn't it have such a strong impact on them? There are a couple of reasons for that. One is that there was a greater population density in Europe and Africa, there were more people and they lived closer together in cities."
Social Studies,"So this gave diseases opportunities to bounce back and forth between people and evolve and become stronger. The other important thing is that Europeans lived close to animals, and as we remember from things like bird flu or swine flu, animals and humans can pass diseases back and forth between each other, and that makes those diseases even stronger. In comparison, Native Americans didn't have much population density and they only domesticated dogs."
Social Studies,"And dogs, unlike pigs, can't pass that many diseases back and forth between humans. So Native Americans just didn't have diseases that were as vicious as the diseases that had been passed from person to person for many thousands of years in Europe and Africa. So this gets to the last aspect of the Columbian Exchange, the exchange of people."
Social Studies,"Very quickly after Europeans arrived, the Native American population suffered from tremendous outbreak of disease, which meant that although the Europeans had hoped to enslave them and use them as a labor force in these Caribbean plantations, very few of them survived, which meant that the Europeans needed another labor force."
Social Studies,"They found that labor source on the West Coast of Africa, where there was a long tradition of slave trading, and they brought enslaved African people against their will across the Atlantic to work in the Caribbean, so that very quickly a majority of the population in the Caribbean was of African descent."
Social Studies,"Ironically, this population explosion brought on by New World foods meant that there were more people in Africa who were possible subjects to enslavement, and it helped them keep their population numbers relatively steady despite the exodus of as many as 12 to 13 million people over the course of the years between Columbus arriving and approximately 1800. Likewise, this population explosion in Europe led to worries about overpopulation in the 1600s and 1700s."
Social Studies,"And what did the nations of Europe do? They began sending people over to the colonies. So the contact and exchange initiated by Christopher Columbus when he connected the Old World with the New had a profound affect on the environment, not just of the New World, but of the Old World as well. And this profound affect on the whole benefited Europe, at the expense of the Americas and of Africa.."
Social Studies,"Now, as you can see from the many individuals here, Spanish colonization was a very complex process taking place in many different regions but in this video I wanna focus in on just a few aspects, the conquest of Mexico by Cortes, a society that came out of this blend of Spanish and Native American culture and a little bit about the resistance to colonization that we'll see in New Mexico with the Pueblo Revolt."
Social Studies,"Now, like Columbus, Spanish explorers originally were looking for a passage to Asia through the Americas but quickly learned that there was quite a lot of riches to be found in the Americas themselves and one place that came to the attention of the conquistadors was Tenochtitlan which was the capital of the Aztec Empire. Now, the Aztecs were not well loved in Mexico."
Social Studies,"They ruled over a vast territory with many smaller tribes they required to give them tribute and even human captives for sacrifice, so in 1519, Hernan Cortes, a Spanish conquistador landed with a group of about 600 men in Vera Cruz and with the help of some translators he worked his way across Mexico learning of the general dislike of the Aztec Empire so that when he finally came upon the city of Tenochtitlan he had about 20,000 Native Americans who were ready to make war on this city along with him."
Social Studies,"Now, it's hard to imagine what Tenochtitlan would have looked like to the Spanish. It's estimated that it had about 200,000 to 300,000 inhabitants which made it one of the larger cities in the world. There was nothing quite so large as this city in all of Europe."
Social Studies,"It sat in the middle of a lake with hanging gardens and an aqueduct and had incredible pyramids that were many stories tall and at first, Moctezuma the Second who was emperor of the Aztec Empire treated the approaching Spaniards with great kindness and generosity showering them with gifts."
Social Studies,"After all, the Spanish had things that Moctezuma had never seen before like horses and gigantic war dogs which they used to rip apart their enemies and cannons which even though they only had a few of them and they didn't work very well were very frightening when they were fired, much like I think a ray gun would be frightening to us now."
Social Studies,"Now, it didn't take very long for the relationship between the Spanish and the Aztecs to crumble and aided by their many native American allies and also by the spread of deadly disease like smallpox which decimated the Native American population, by 1521 Tenochtitlan had fallen, in fact, was in ruins."
Social Studies,"Moctezuma had died and the Spanish began building on the ruins of Tenochtitlan, Mexico City but much to the horror of the many Native American tribes that had allied with the Spanish, the Spanish would turn out to be much crueler imperial masters than the Aztecs had been and the smallpox that had ravaged the Aztecs, ravaged the rest of the Native American population as well as they lacked the immunity to European disease."
Social Studies,"Although much of the conquest of the Spanish Empire in the New World was done by conquistadors, adventurers, the Spanish Crown was eager to place some control over this new territory and one way that they did was through the Encomiendas System and the Encomiendas System was a labor system that in a way was kind of a combination of feudalism from Europe and slavery."
Social Studies,"So, the idea was that the Spanish Crown would grant land holders called encomenderos the right to the labor of Native Americans, perhaps a village or two and anything that those Native Americans produced through their slave labor, so gold if they mined it or agricultural products if they were working on a plantation and in theory what the Native Americans would get for this would be Christianization which to the Catholic Spanish Crown was an important goal to convert all of the world's people to Catholicism and also the protection of these Spanish feudal lords or encomenderos."
Social Studies,"In practice the Encomiendas System was really just another way of saying slavery and between the harsh treatment of the Spanish lords and disease, the native population of this region went from about 20 million when the Spanish arrived to only about two million by 1600, so that not very long after conquest, the Spanish began to bring enslaved Africans to labor in the New World as the Native American population had shrunk to a fraction of its former size."
Social Studies,"So, for the native people of Mexico the arrival of the Spanish was about the worst outcome of an alien invasion that you could imagine. Now, native people did resist the Spanish in many ways. Some ways were more subtle like outwardly adopting Christianity while maintaining their ancestral beliefs inwardly."
Social Studies,"The combination of Native American beliefs and Christianity together is called syncretism or the blending of two religious traditions but sometimes the Spanish pushed native people too far as in the case of the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 when after a few generations of being forced to shed all of their religious beliefs in favor of Christianity or face severe punishment, the pueblo people rose up against the Spanish led by a man named Pope, so that sometimes the Pueblo Revolt is also called Pope's Rebellion and they killed Spanish priests, burned churches, replaced them with kivas, their own place of worship and drove the Spanish out so that in the next 50 years it took the Spanish to reestablish control of this region, the Spanish took a much more accommodating approach to pueblo society."
Social Studies,The last aspect of Spanish colonial society that I wanna point out is the racial caste system that developed in the New World.
Social Studies,"Because the conquistadors were on dangerous adventures, very few Spanish women came with them in the New World and so, Spanish men had relationships with both native women and African women and Native Americans and Africans had relationships such that there was really an unprecedented mixing of peoples and cultures in the New World and to account for this incredibly diverse society the Spanish developed a caste system that very carefully ranked individuals by how much Spanish blood they had so that people with pure Spanish blood, criollos were at the top of the hierarchy, and people who had both Native American heritage and European heritage were called mestizo at the time whereas people with European heritage and African heritage were called mulatto at the time and so, as you moved up or down this scale you had more legal rights than the groups below you and this is what is known as a casta painting which very carefully categorized where every person fell on this hierarchy of race, so we see in the Spanish caste system the beginnings of assigning legal status to individuals based on their race but I think it's also important to note here that the casta system made a place for many different types of people in society and that will be important later when we contrast it with how English settlers treated Native Americans."
Social Studies,"The Spanish sought to Christianize and incorporate and enslave native people, whereas the English sought to completely eradicate them from the landscape.."
Social Studies,"So how is it possible to make a direct comparison between Native American cultures and European cultures? One way is to choose a few categories of social interaction and belief and identify how each group conceived of them. Here, I've chosen ideas about land and property ownership, gender roles, and religion as areas to compare."
Social Studies,"Now before we start, I wanna put a big asterisk here and say that these are generalizations, just as the English, French, Spanish, Dutch didn't have all exactly the same religion or a concept of proper gender roles. The Algonquians, Iroquois, Pueblos, and Mississippians weren't identical either, but there were some similarities among European groups and among Native American groups that allow us to compare and contrast them more broadly."
Social Studies,"So let's start identifying these differences and exploring what effect they may have had on how the two groups perceived and interacted with each other. One major difference between Europeans and Native Americans was in their ideas about land ownership. To Europeans, land was owned by individuals and passed down through families. They had the right to fence off a plot of land and prevent trespassing. For Native Americans, land ownership was less defined and more temporary."
Social Studies,"One tribe might claim control of a hunting range or one family might farm a plot of land for a season but they didn't own it forever. Most land was free for everyone to use but not to own. So when Europeans arrived, Native Americans might agree to let them farm and hunt in their territories but they didn't expect that Europeans would then fence off that land and prevent others from using it."
Social Studies,"Likewise, Europeans were confused when Native Americans continued to use land that they thought they had purchased to own forever. Native Americans also tended to have a more communal approach to property and trade. To them, trading relationship were important and they require a lot of feasting and gift giving to cement ties between tribes. Europeans were frequently frustrated by the amount of pomp and circumstance Native Americans demanded to complete what they saw as a simple business transaction."
Social Studies,"Partly, this had to do with how Native Americans viewed property in general. While Europeans gained high status in society by owning a lot of things and therefore being rich, Native Americans achieved high status by giving a lot of things away, being a source of riches for others. So unlike in Europe where there were huge gaps between the rich and the poor, Native American societies were comparatively egalitarian. It was pretty rare for someone to go hungry if their neighbor had food to spare."
Social Studies,"Europeans couldn't tell if Native Americans were just naturally generous, kind people or if they maybe just didn't get how business worked and to Native Americans, Europeans seemed greedy and selfish, allowing others to starve and do without so that they could enrich themselves. Differences in gender roles also confused the groups. In European societies, men were the heads of household and they were in charge of outdoor labor. Women took care of the home but they also have relatively few rights."
Social Studies,"They couldn't participate politically, own property, or get divorced. In Native American societies, men hunted and fished and conducted warfare which often meant that they were away from home for weeks or months. Consequently, women did the farming since they were home to tend the crops. Native women also had a lot more freedom than European women. They could get divorced, they could give political advice to councils."
Social Studies,"Many Native American societies were matrilineal so children belonged to their mother's family rather than their father's and when a couple got married, the man moved in with his wife's family, not the other way around. To Europeans, gender roles in Native society almost seemed like they were flipped upside down and they took this as evidence that Native people were uncivilized. To Native Americans, it looked like Europeans could barely care for themselves."
Social Studies,"They had to be taught how to farm, how to fish, even how to hunt effectively in the new world. Finally, Native and European religious practices differ, at least, on the surface. Native Americans tended to believe that one great creator had made the world and that nature was imbued with spirits who would reward or punish them based on how well they took care of the land."
Social Studies,"In fact, this actually wasn't that much different from the Catholicism of Europeans who believed in a single god but also many helpful saints. But where they differed was in exclusivity. When Europeans introduced them to Jesus and Mary and the saints, many Native Americans were happy to include them in their pantheon of helpful spirits. But this angered Europeans who insisted on exclusive worship of the Christian god."
Social Studies,"All of this differences lead to fraught interactions between Europeans and Native Americans. But despite these differences, they also adopted many useful aspects of each other's culture over time especially in terms of trade. Native Americans were keen to get their hands on the metal implements for cooking and farming and hunting that Europeans possessed as well as guns and horses which were great for transportation and also for making war."
Social Studies,"Europeans were also willing to take part in the social rituals and trading rituals of Native Americans, sometimes even marrying into Native American families so they could get access to furs hunted by Native Americans and to Native Americans as allies in their wars against rival European powers and the Americas. So as we wrap up, I encourage you to take a closer look at this chart."
Social Studies,"Is there anything you find particularly surprising about these differences? Where do you think that Europeans and Native Americans were most likely to find common ground between them? And lastly, which of these cultural aspects do you think was the most significant difference between Europeans and Native Americans and why?."
Social Studies,"In this video, I'd like to take some time to talk about two of the lesser known European colonies in the New World, New France up here in pink and New Netherland, this little orange dot right here."
Social Studies,"Now, you can see that compared to the extent of New Spain, here in the Caribbean and Mexico and expanding in South America, these colonial exploits were pretty small indeed, but I think it's important to learn a little bit about them because they help us see the ways in which the different goals of colonial powers led to very different types of settlement in the New World and very different relationships between Europeans and Native Americans."
Social Studies,"Now, though it's a little bit hard to see on this map, these two colonies focused their efforts around two rivers, the Saint Lawrence River and the Hudson River which runs along this little orange strip here. And along these rivers, you can still see the cities that were founded by these colonial ventures like Quebec City up in Canada, later Montreal and down here of course the most famous which started as New Amsterdam and later became the city of New York."
Social Studies,"Right about here is the Island of Manhattan on which New York City, formerly New Amsterdam, is located. Now, looking at this map, you might wonder, why was it that Spain have these giant swabs of territory really from coast to coast where New France and New Netherland really only followed along these rivers, at least to start with? And the answer really lies in this idea of goals."
Social Studies,"And New France and New Netherland sat on the rivers, rivers being the highways of the world really up until the invention of the railroad, because they were primarily interested in trade. So let's talk a little bit more about that. French and Dutch explorers were particularly interested in gaining valuable furs to trade from Native Americans living in the Northern part of North America that they could then sell in Europe."
Social Studies,"Long before European colonization began, beavers had been hunted pretty much to extinction in Europe while beaver pelts themselves were usually used to create fancy hats."
Social Studies,"This is a hat from a slightly later era, but you can get the sense here that Europeans met on something of an equal basis with Native Americans in the process of the fur trade, so Europeans wanted beaver pelts and also the pelts of other animals and often fish, another thing that was in great supply in this Northern region which is today the Northeast United States and Canada."
Social Studies,"So how did this focus on trade affect the relationships between Europeans and Native Americans in the area? Well, primarily they made relationships between them considerably friendlier and more cooperative than the relationships between the Spanish and Native Americans for example."
Social Studies,"Now, Europeans quickly discovered that it made a lot more sense to instead of sending hundreds upon hundreds of Frenchmen to Canada to hunt beavers themselves, they could instead pay Native Americans to hunt the beavers for them. And consequently, there were considerably fewer French and Dutch settlers in New Netherland and New France than there were in New Spain."
Social Studies,"And because there were fewer of them, they generally ended up doing things more on the terms of Native Americans so whereas the Spanish might have used their guns and their war dogs to force Native Americans to labor for them, the French and the Dutch were more likely to observe trading rituals like giving gifts and also fostering trade relationships through intermarriage."
Social Studies,"French traders learned the Algonquian language and married native women and had children with them so that they could be considered part of the family. They even allied with Native American Tribes against their own enemies and went to war with them as in the case in 1609 when French explorer Samuel de Champlain helped Algonquians in their war against the Iroquois. And like New France, New Netherland situated as it was in this very good harbor, the Island of Manhattan, was likewise very focused on trade."
Social Studies,"In fact, New Amsterdam was a little bit of a company town controlled by the Dutch West India Company which sought to make the most of all of the goodies that could be brought from North America and then shipped to Europe. In fact, you can get a sense of what the major concerns of the Europeans settling in this area were from this map."
Social Studies,"You can see that they point out where beavers, turkeys, foxes, and bears can be found all with their valuable pelts, but you also see that there's an extremely detailed rendering of where many Native American Tribes lived like this detailed rendering of what I believe is a Mahican village. The French and Dutch bothered to learn all of these names and map all of this territory because they cooperated with the Native Americans to get these pelts."
Social Studies,"It's hard to imagine a Spanish map that would go into such detail about native villages. It's important to remember that Europeans were competing with each other for resources in the New World hoping that they could secure the best trade deals for furs with Native Americans and prevent other nations from securing those furs. For example, the Dutch allied with the Iroquois in the New World as trading partners because the Iroquois were the long-time enemies of the Algonquians who were allied with the French."
Social Studies,"So just as the Europeans recruited Native Americans into their competitions to supply Europe with furs, Native Americans recruited Europeans into their inter-tribal feuds to supply the Americas with European goods. I wanna finish by just briefly comparing each nation's colonial goals with their outcomes and what sorts of people settled, what the relationships were like with Native Americans, and even how they attempted or didn't attempt to convert Native Americans to a form of Christianity."
Social Studies,"Now, as we saw with Spain, their goal was to quickly extract natural resources from the Americas and to set up plantations for tobacco and later sugar, plus to convert as many of the native people to Catholicism as possible by force if necessary and it was frequently necessary."
Social Studies,"Consequently, most of the Spanish settlers who came to the New World were men and adventurers who treated native people with violence and enslaved them in the encomienda system and in some cases had relationships with native women and African women that resulted in that very complex set of racial designations we see in the caste system. But France and the Netherlands by contrast came for trade."
Social Studies,"They wanted furs and fish and so they were very careful to cultivate very friendly relationships with Native Americans including by intermarrying with them in a deliberate and formal way so that they could take advantage of having natives do the hunting for them rather than having to do it themselves so that really only a few men came to New France and New Netherland, nothing like the numbers of Spain."
Social Studies,"And unlike the Spanish, although the French did attempt to convert natives to Catholicism, they rarely did so by force. Now, going forward as we talk about British colonization in the next few lessons, I want you to keep both the Spanish and the French and Dutch modes of colonization in your mind so you can compare and contrast English colonization with both of them."
Social Studies,"And as we'll see, the goals of the various English colonies whether it's to found plantations like in Jamestown, Virginia, or to escape religious persecution like in Massachusetts Bay, that goal will go on to influence not only who came to the Americas from Europe, but also their relationships with native people.."
Social Studies,"England, by contrast, didn't actually have a successful colonial venture in the New World until 1607 with Jamestown. Now from this distance it doesn't look that far behind, but this is more than 100 years later than Spain's first colonial ventures. So what was England up to? Why were they so late in the colonial game? That's what I'd like to take a closer look at in this video, and I'll also talk a little bit more about what conditions in England led that nation to start New World colonies."
Social Studies,"Now I think the biggest reason why England waited another 100 years to have a New World colony is that England had its own problems, and it had a number of problems in this time period, and we're talking about the 1500s here. And the first of these was ongoing conflict between Catholics and Protestants in England. Now this is a very long story."
Social Studies,"I don't have time to do justice to it here, but suffice it to say that the trouble started with Henry VIII, who we know from his many wives and many beheadings, and Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church in Rome to start his own church, the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church. Now this is a Protestant religion. I'm gonna put P here for Protestant."
Social Studies,"Now Henry had two daughters, Elizabeth who like him was a Protestant, and Mary, who was a Catholic, and Mary occupied the throne for a number of years, but Elizabeth managed to wrest it away from her and once Elizabeth was on the throne as Elizabeth I, England became a Protestant nation. So it's hard to be involved in world affairs when you've got kind of a crisis of succession going on, so one factor here is religious conflict."
Social Studies,Another reason why England is not headed over to the New World is that they have colonial problems closer to home in Ireland.
Social Studies,"England is trying to, and will succeed at, subduing Ireland as one of its colonies, and they're undertaking a very bloody and costly war, and they think of this Catholic Irish population almost as barbarian savages who don't know what's good for them and in the opinion of the English, what's good for them is English rule and Protestantism, when of course what the Irish really want is self rule and to be left alone, but they use very brutal tactics against the Irish, and we'll kind of see that again when they're met with another hostile colonial population in North America."
Social Studies,Another issue England is dealing with is economic depression.
Social Studies,"The Crown doesn't have a lot of money and there's a great deal of crime and poverty throughout the nation, so while the Crown can't actually afford to sponsor colonial exploits the way that Spain sponsored Columbus, they still managed to get some riches out of the New World by giving ship captains license to plunder Spanish ships coming back with New World riches, and these were called privateers, the most famous of them here is this man, Sir Francis Drake, and really, privateers are just pirates with a fancy name, but the logic here was, why bother trying to set up a colony here in Mexico or South America, the West Indies, and do all the work of setting up housing and trying to tame laborers and mining, when instead you could just let the Spanish do all of that and then put that gold on a ship and then use your awesome navy, 'cause England is growing a very awesome navy, to steal those riches."
Social Studies,"So England doesn't have a strong incentive to do all the labor when they can just steal it from the ships along the way. Alright, those are some of the reasons why it took England so long to start colonization in North America. In the next video I'll talk about the factors that led England to finally join the race for New World colonies.."
Social Studies,"So what changes that allows England to become a premier colonial empire and go on to found what will be the United States of America, today even an English speaking country? Well, some of these factors kind of turn to their advantage. Once the internal religious conflict has been sorted out, turning England into a Protestant nation, they turn some of that animus outward to Spain, a Catholic nation, and they feel that they have to compete with Spain for riches and for souls."
Social Studies,"So certainly, the Protestant nation of England doesn't wanna be left behind anymore than it already has been by Spain, which has clearly been reaping great riches from the New World in the form of gold down here in Mexico and Central America and sugar, the Sugar Islands, and they also don't wanna be one upped by the Catholic nation of France, which has been reaping some excellent profits trading with Native Americans up in the region which is today New York and Canada, and they're getting furs."
Social Studies,So there's clearly a lot to be had in the new world and a lot of Catholics to triumph over in having it. Another thing that allows England to join the imperial game in the New World is the invention of the Joint Stock Company.
Social Studies,"Now, Joint Stock Companies were kind of the precursor, I mean, more than kind of the precursor, really the precursor to the modern day corporation, and like modern day corporations, what they did was kind of spread both the riches and also the risk of any kind of entrepreneurial undertaking. And what I mean by this is that people could buy shares in a Joint Stock Company, and those shares were kind of divested from your personal wealth."
Social Studies,"So you could invest in something that, if it went belly up, wouldn't necessarily ruin you 'cause you just had a few shares. So it's, you know, similar to the stock market today, a very early version of that. So these Joint Stock Companies meant that adventurers, people seeking wealth, could go out to the New World, for example, with many different backers, the risk spread across all of them, and try to make profit for their investors."
Social Studies,So many what we would call promoters of the New World tried to drum up interest in expeditions to the New World.
Social Studies,"Now, everybody knows that Spain is making a killing from gold and sugar, and so they're saying, ""Well, maybe private individuals ""with the blessing, though not the sponsorship ""of the crown can go to the New World ""and start extracting some of these resources ""and start creating wealth for their investors."" And so England issues several charters to Joint Stock Companies that are still familiar names to us today."
Social Studies,"For example, the East India Company, which Americans know best as the company that supplied the tea that Bostonians dumped into Boston Harbor slightly before the American Revolution, but the one that plays the most role in the early founding of the United States is the Virginia Company, and it's under the auspices of the Virginia Company that explorers like John Smith head to Virginia and Virginia is named for Elizabeth the First, Henry the Eighth's daughter, who never married, and therefore was said to be the Virgin Queen, so a new land named after her was Virginia."
Social Studies,"Now, we'll talk more about the Virginia Company in the next video, but the last thing I wanna say about what prompted England to join the imperial game in the New World was that England was having a serious economic depression and some real poverty. Now remember that England was a highly classed society with aristocracy and gentry, and these were inherited roles, right? You couldn't rise to be among these ranks, generally."
Social Studies,"So, you know, about 95% of the population didn't belong to either of these groups, and a strong majority of those were in dire poverty in the 1500s and early 1600s, and there were a number of reasons for this. The market for wool, which England, being a major textile producer, had collapsed, so many people who had been wool producers were in dire straits."
Social Studies,"In fact, many of them were Puritans, and we'll see more about what happens to the Puritans who leave England in another video, and there's a process going on in this time period known as enclosure, the Enclosure Movement. And what enclosure meant is kind of what it sounds like, which is that early English towns and manor houses were kind of set up to have, you know, the house."
Social Studies,"That's the big manor house, so just bear with me and imagine here, and then they might have some forest filled with a nice deer to hunt, and then they might have some nice fields, just grass, and these were kind of considered common lands. So if you were a peasant, for example, you might graze your cows on these common lands. You might go hunting in the forest. Well, in this time period, these great English lords started to close off, enclose these common lands. So they'd fence them off."
Social Studies,"This kind of makes sense to our modern idea of property holding, right? It makes us understand who owns what thing and how it gets deeded, et cetera, but for very poor people, this was a huge transition because now they didn't have a place to raise their livestock. They didn't have a source of hunting, protein, so it made people who were already on the edge of poverty extremely poor. It was a very difficult time if you were already kind of living in the foraging or small farming aspect of English life."
Social Studies,"And so, because of this Enclosure Movement and depression, crime rates are going up in England, and this is a time when theft is still a capital crime. So if you're starving and you steal something to eat, you could be hanged, and so many of the English gentry, the people in Parliament, are looking around and saying, ""Alright, what's going on? ""Are we having a moral crisis?"" Because they don't think in terms that say, ""Alright, many people are poor."
Social Studies,"""Maybe they're going to steal."" Instead, they're saying, ""Why are people stealing? ""What's wrong with people?"" And so they think of this as surplus population, say there are too many people in England. Now this is patently untrue because there are way more people living in London today than there were in all of England at that time period, but the English Parliament, sort of major thinkers in England, start to think that there are too many people in England."
Social Studies,"There are just too many people for having enough stuff to go around, and so they start wondering. Maybe these people should go elsewhere. Maybe they should go to colonies where maybe they can buy more goods, produce more raw materials, and find a different place in the social structure and economy of England, and that starts to come true when the Virginia Company sets off for Jamestown, which they'll reach in 1607, and we'll talk about that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this is something I've been learning a lot about lately, and I think is really interesting. You know, we often think about this just in terms of the spookiness of, there's this colony and it disappeared, and we still don't know what happened to it. But actually, I think it has a lot to say about the process of colonization in the New World, and the many political, and weather, and economic factors that went into making a colony successful or not successful. - [David] So set this up for me."
Social Studies,"What is going on during the period of this early settlement of what they called Virginia, but actually turned out to be, where Kim? - [Kim] North Carolina. So this on the outer banks, and it's today, it's still Roanoke Island, but one of these sort of barrier islands off the coast of North Carolina. - [David] So, a great place to put a ship? - [Kim] Actually, what they call this area is the Graveyard of the Atlantic. - [David] So I'm hearing not so much."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Right, so this is an area where there are a lot of shoals, lots of ships run aground there. If you ever go to one of the museums on the outer banks, you can see this incredibly long listing of all of the ships that sank off the coast of North Carolina. It is a very difficult place to sail. - [David] What year is it when we first see, when we see the first colonization attempt at Roanoke? The first expedition."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Right, this all starts in the late 1570s with a man named Humphrey Gilbert, and Gilbert is convinced-- - [David] Is this him? - [Kim] This is actually Sir Walter Raleigh. - [David] Oh, he is cute. - [Kim] Yes, Gilbert's half-brother as it turns out. So Sir Walter Raleigh's half-brother, Humphrey Gilbert, thinks that it might be possible to make your way to the Indies and fabulous riches. Make that line a little bit bigger. By going on top of North America. So he thinks there's a waterway here."
Social Studies,"So he convinces Queen Elizabeth, then on the throne of England, to give him a charter to try to plant a colony somewhere on this side of North America. - [David] So they're looking for the Northwest Passage, is what they're looking for. - [Kim] They're looking for the Northwest Passage. They're hoping that they can find gold, and what they want to do more than anything else is just mess up Spain's chances in the New World."
Social Studies,"Because Spain, starting with Christopher Columbus, has been the leading old world power in the New World. They are just like, trucking back the gold and silver, and most of what England has done up until this point, is find Spanish ships that are coming back from Mexico, from the West Indies, and put what are called privateers, which is a nice word that the English used to mean pirate, to steal things. - [David] State-sanctioned piracy. - [Kim] State-sanctioned piracy."
Social Studies,"- [David] So like, Shakespeare is like a young man at this time, right? - [Kim] Yes. - [David] Like that is the period of Elizabethan England that we're looking at right now. - [Kim] Yeah, it's kind of, in some ways, a golden age, but when you think about how well the English are doing when it comes to colonization, it is not a golden age, they are way behind. So they're hoping maybe they can find a northwest passage to get all of the goodies over here in India, and the spice islands."
Social Studies,"They're hoping that maybe they could find some good minerals in this area, get some gold of their own. But at the very least, they'd like a nice port from which their ships could go out and steal more stuff from Spanish ships. - [David] (laughs) Sure. - [Kim] Yeah, this is a good, this is their plan. - [David] So this is kind of, if you'll permit me, this feel analogous to the space race during the Cold War. - [Kim] Yeah, absolutely."
Social Studies,"- [David] So Spain is this economic superpower that seems to have a one, you know, have a leg up on England. Just like how the Soviet Union launched Sputnik first."
Social Studies,"Got a satellite into orbit above Earth, and that spurred the United States to be like, ""No, we're gonna have a moon shot!"" - [Kim] Yeah, and it kinda turns out the same way in some aspects, because as we know, we're sitting here in California, we're speaking English, because eventually England is going to win its way to dominance in this entire region. But originally, Spain gets off to the fastest start, and England is just desperate to catch up. So unfortunately, Sir Humphrey Gilbert dies."
Social Studies,"He is lost at sea. - [David] So not this guy here with Queen Elizabeth. - [Kim] Right, then his half-brother, Sir Walter Raleigh, which he spelled with no I, so we'll do that, but today the city that's named after him, we still spell with an I. He picked up his half-brother's contract, which said he had to get a colony in the New World within six years of 1578. So he is under the gun to try to get something happening on the coast of North America by 1584 at the latest."
Social Studies,"So he picks up his friends, and decides to put together, what I kind of term as like the Ocean's Eleven of the actual ocean. - [David] (laughs) Okay. - [Kim] He finds some ship captains, and soldiers. - [David] A demolition's expert, a contortionist. (Kim laughs) A con man. - [Kim] Similar, this is like the, the 1500s version of this. He gets an artist, who we'll talk a lot more about. - [David] That's John White? - [Kim] That's John White."
Social Studies,"He gets cartographers, he gets what he considers his A-team, to go out and explore this coast. Pick up where his half-brother left off. The only problem was that Sir Walter Ralegh and Queen Elizabeth were sweethearts. And she forbid him from going on this dangerous journey. After all, his brother had also died on this journey. So she loved him too much, said ""You can't go."" But his friends went. So this is their first journey, and they go to North Carolina."
Social Studies,"They called it Virginia, because this whole area they named after Queen Elizabeth. - [David] The Virgin Queen. - [Kim] The Virgin Queen, and a lot of the things in this time period are kinda named after her, because all of these fellows were trying to capture her heart. So they go, and what's really interesting about this is that John White, this artist, shows us so much about what this area was like. And I want to show you some of the paintings that he made in this time period."
Social Studies,"- [David] So who were the native people that this expedition encountered? - [Kim] So they end up on the barrier islands of North Carolina, and this is where the colonists will eventually settle here, Roanoke Island. The major Native American groups in this area were Algonquian-speaking. So they are kinda in the middle of what we call the east coast today. - [David] So this is a tidewater people. - [Kim] They're a tidewater people."
Social Studies,"You can see that they live in long houses, like other Algonquian peoples, and these are primarily the Secotan people and the Croatoan people. Initially the English people get along with them pretty well. They exchange skins, and food, lots of things. The English come back, thinking this is a pretty good deal. - [David] So John White and company, John White and Sir Walter Ralegh's Eleven, or however many, right, return to England."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Right, and they say, ""This is a great place for us to settle."" So then they send a second expedition from England. This time with just soldiers. It's very similar to how Jamestown is going to work out a little bit later, which is to say they send sailors, they send soldiers, and they send people who might, for example, be good at finding gold, so artisans. And they're hoping to kinda get rich quick."
Social Studies,"They think maybe there are mountains nearby that might have gold or gems in them, or perhaps, they're always asking that native people, ""Do you have anything shiny? ""Have you heard of anything that's shiny nearby?"" Because they want to make their investors back in England happy by making a big profit. - [David] So this is like halfway between a forward operating base and a trading post. - [Kim] Exactly. - [David] Okay."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So they're not thinking about long-term settlement, but they're left there over the winter with the Secotan people, and this is just a bunch of rowdy soldiers who thought they were gonna get rich quick, and they don't, because there is no gold in North Carolina, not like there is in the south, that the Spanish do so well with. And they quickly come to grief with the Native Americans. They steal a lot of their food."
Social Studies,"- [David] Who steals whose food? - [Kim] The English steal the food of the Secotans, and they end up getting into a brawl over the possible theft of a silver cup. - [David] (laughs) Really? - [Kim] Yeah, they think the Native Americans have stolen a silver cup from them. They demand it back, the Native Americans say, ""We don't know what you're talking about."" And then the English kill a bunch of people. - [David] Oh my gosh."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So relations that were going pretty well, went pretty badly over, what I think, is kind of a minor incident. But by the time that the uh, supplies show up, because the English are sending supply ships on a regular basis, Sir Francis Drake, of piracy fame, shows up with supplies, and a bunch of these 100 men just get back on the ship and sail to England."
Social Studies,"- [David] So wait, before we go back to England with these men, what contributed to this disproportionate response, of like killing a bunch of people over a single silver cup? - [Kim] I think a lot of it was that many of these men, now and on later expeditions, are English veterans of the war in Ireland. So there is an Irish rebellion against English rule there, and the English take a very brutal stance toward the Irish."
Social Studies,"They just burned their villages, they decapitate Irish people and line their heads along sidewalks, I'm not making this up. - [David] Good lord. - [Kim] So, they're veterans of this really brutal Irish repression. And this is something that I think you see a lot with English people when they first are meeting Native Americans, they treat them like they treated the Irish, which is to say, very badly."
Social Studies,"They treat them as savages who are different religion, who need to be subject to the English, and need to be taught early on that they need to obey the English. - [David] So what happened after that, Kim? - [Kim] We'll get to that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"Sir Walter Raleigh and John White realized that a whole group of soldiers was probably not the right group to send to the New World. Instead he thinks, alright, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna send civilians. - [Man] Okay. - [Kim] We're gonna send families. So they send about 90 men, about 20 women, and maybe about 10 children. And say okay, you are going to start a colony and a settlement in the New World. So it's not just a trading post."
Social Studies,"- [Man] Yo, but back up, like still on Roanoke Island next to the Native Americans that hate them? (laughing) Is that where they're still putting the colony? - [Kim] Well, they were really hoping since they've discovered that this is a terrible place to sail-- - [Man] Uh huh? - [Kim] That they can actually head up to the Chesapeake Bay and make that their place of operations. - [Man] Why not just make landfall there? - [Kim] Well, they usually started by going from England all the way down to Bahamas."
Social Studies,"- [Man] Mm hmm. - [Kim] Where they could refuel. So this was an area where they already had power. So instead of going to the unknown land first, they would go down to the West Indies, meet up, - [Man] Get fresh water, get food. - [Kim] Get fresh water and supplies and then come up to Virginia, AKA North Carolina. Unfortunately, as the weather worked out, they couldn't make it farther than Roanoke Island. - [Man] Oh."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So they are hanging out with what they hope are their friends, the Secotans, and right after they get there one of the English colonists is murdered by probably a Secotan person, and it's because they say to their translators, we don't have enough food, you're gonna steal more food and we just can't have you here. It's obvious that they brought women and children, they're intending to stay, and the Native Americans have decided that the English are not to be trusted."
Social Studies,"- [Man] So this is just a whole series of tragic diplomacy by ultimatum movements, right? - [Kim] Yeah, it's really interesting because I think there are a couple of places here where things might have gone very differently. - [Man] You can see the inflection points if both sides decided not to play hardball with each other so much. - [Kim] Yeah, I think there are so many places here where ships get lost or they get grounded on the shoals outside North Carolina so they can't get more supplies."
Social Studies,"Or later storms will prevent reinforcements. Weather and a silver cup are kind of the things that keep the Roanoke Colony from succeeding. So right away after this new group of colonists arrives, one of them is murdered and so they ask their governor, John White, to go back to England and get them more supplies. - [Man] John White, the illustrator who made these images on the right. - [Kim] And he's now governor. - [Man] Okay."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] He's the only one of the original Raleigh's 11 who's still part of this venture. So he's now moved up in the ranks. So John White sails back to England, and then he runs into a big problem, the Spanish, basically. He wanted to get supplies. Some of these colonists, including the Dares, are actually John White's children. - [Man] Oh, snap. - [Kim] So this is his actual family that's here that he's trying to protect."
Social Studies,"So he goes back to England and he says, Sir Walter Raleigh, I need more reinforcements. But all English shipping is cut off because of the threat of the Spanish. The Spanish Armada is coming to England at this time period and so not a single ship can be spared to go try to bail out these colonists in the New World. - [Man] Oh, wow. So they're alone and entirely isolated on this new continent among people that do not like them because of stuff that people before them did."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Exactly, yeah, that's about the size of it. So it's like 1588 when John White sails back to England and because of the Spanish Armada it's not until 1590 that he can finally get back and try to find these colonists including his family. - [Man] Right. - [Kim] When he gets there this is all he finds, the word, Croatoan, carved into a tree. - [Man] What do you mean all he found? What happened to their town? - [Kim] It was completely abandoned. - [Man] Whoa."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So it looks as if they'd left of their own volition. - Okay. - Because it doesn't look like there was an attack there. And they had agreed beforehand that if they decided to go somewhere else, remember, they already knew that they were in unwelcome territory, so they thought maybe they'd go farther inland, they would leave traces, they would carve something in a tree to say where they had gone."
Social Studies,"Unfortunately, another storm hit, and so John White was forced to leave and go back to England without ever going to see the Croatoans, this other Native American tribe, along with their town called, Croatoan, to see where the rest of his family and the rest of the colonists were. - [Man] Did he ever return in his lifetime? - [Kim] No he did not. - [Man] Oh, that's heartbreaking."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So he never found out what happened to his family, and technically we never found out what happened to the Lost Colony at Roanoke, but there's some pretty good evidence about what might have happened to them. - [Man] Tell it to me, Kim. - [Kim] Alright, so here's what we think may have happened. So there are about 130 people, right? - [Man] Right. - [Kim] Assuming that none of them died from disease. - [Man] That's a charitable assumption. - [Kim] Yeah."
Social Studies,"Not all of them could have gone to see and live with the Croatoans. - [Man] Okay. - [Kim] Right, because they were a much smaller tribe than that. So they could never have been all supported by these people. What we think happened is that some of them went to live with the Croatoans who are along the coast. So if John White comes back then they can connect up with him again. So that's what we think happened to some of them."
Social Studies,"We also think that some of them went further inland to a more stable environment around what is maybe called, Merry Hill. So about 15, oh sorry, about 50 miles inland from Roanoke Island. - [Man] Okay. - [Kim] Today Merry Hill, North Carolina. And we think some of them may have gone north. So here's the evidence about these various things. - [Man] How do we know that these colonists went there? - [Kim] So when John White was sailing to Roanoke he saw big fires along the coast where the Croatoans lived."
Social Studies,"So we think the English may have been there trying to signal them, but he went straight to Roanoke, and then because of his troubles with his ship had to go back to England. So there's strong evidence there. Also, later an Englishman heard a legend from the people who lived in that region that some of their ancestors had been White people, and they had English coins."
Social Studies,"So I think it's probably safe to say that some of them did actually intermarry with Croatoans and lived there for most of the rest of their lives. The ones who went north we know about because John Smith, the captain of the Jamestown Colony in 1607, met up with some Native Americans who told him that there had been White people living in the area who had lived peacefully among the Native Americans until just recently when they were massacred by the Powhatans."
Social Studies,"Powhatan was the father of Pocahontas, right? So there's some overlap here. - [Man] So he was trying to get the lay of the land, how the local people felt about the English, and the intelligence that he got was, oh, everyone's cool with the English except for the people that you're living right next to. - [Kim] (laughs) I think it was probably intended, yeah, to be maybe a warning. - [Man] Yeah."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] We think what might actually have happened was that the people from Roanoke had intermarried with another Native American tribe and had become kind of indistinguishable from them, and then the Powhatans, who were kind of a larger empire, actually attacked them. So they were killed off in a raid against other Native American groups. - [Man] I see."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] And the last thing that we think that they probably went inland is from a recent archaeological dig which has discovered, it's called English Border ware. - [Man] Okay. - [Kim] In this town near Merry Hill, North Carolina, and it was only made in this time period before these English colonists left. So we know it has to have dated before 1588. - [Man] 90 or so, okay."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Yeah, so it's highly likely that at least some of those people had been living in this area because we have an archaeological record of them. - [Man] That's so cool. - [Kim] What I think is really interesting about this is we actually know a lot more about this than I think popular legend says that we do. - [Man] Yeah, I always thought that the Lost Colony at Roanoke was one of those unsolvable secrets of history. - [Kim] I think it tells us a lot about the historical process."
Social Studies,"In some ways we know a lot about this. In other ways we don't know much at all. There are some things in history that we don't have records about, and perhaps never will. But if I had to say that there's one thing that's really haunting about this Colony at Roanoke is just how different things might have been had they chosen to be friendly about the theft of a silver cup, that may or may not have happened, rather than angry and violent."
Social Studies,"We could be talking about the Colony of Roanoke as the very first successful English Colony in the New World. - [Man] You and I could have been speaking an Algonquian-English dialect right now. - [Kim] Quite possibly. So it shows us just how important even the smallest events in history can be to the way that things turn out, and how much people's choices really do matter.."
Social Studies,"In 1607, when the Virginia Company, a joint-stock company, or an early precursor to the modern corporation, which spread out both the shares, the wealth, and the risk of an expedition like one headed to the New World. They received a charter for New World exploration from King James I, who had now taken over for Queen Elizabeth, and their goals were kinda the same as many of the goals of explorers in this time period. They wanted to find gold."
Social Studies,"They wanted to find a passage to the Indies that might make it easier for them to get the luxurious materials like spices and silk that were so expensive to get over the land route that was the silk road. And, James in particular was hoping that they could maybe get one up on the Spanish, who had been doing so well for more than 100 years in the West Indies."
Social Studies,"Now one of the important things to note about this is that no one who went to Virginia expected to set up a colony there and live there for the rest of their lives. What they expected was to go for a couple of years, mine tremendous amounts of gold, which they hoped were lying in giant piles all over the ground. Get tremendously wealthy, and live like kings for the rest of their lives in Europe. So this Virginia Company expedition was intended to be short-term."
Social Studies,"But, as it'll turn out, that will not be the case. So how did things go for the Virginia Company compared to the Roanoke Island colonists? Well, not terrifically better. They sailed in early 1607 into the Chesapeake Bay, and they spent some time looking for what might be a good place to settle, and they eventually chose a site here on what they'll name the James River, for King James, and in the town that they'll call Jamestown for the same reason."
Social Studies,"It's hard to overstate how terrible the land that they chose at Jamestown was, and it was terrible for a couple of reasons. One reason is that the soil isn't terrifically good there. It's marshy, it's not great for growing subsistence crops, which you'll need to survive."
Social Studies,"And more importantly, it's buggy, and by buggy I mean that there are tons of mosquitoes, and mosquitoes carry diseases like yellow fever, malaria, and those mosquito-borne diseases will have a tremendous effect, a huge death toll for the early settlers at Jamestown. The other thing I can't overstate about the colonists at Jamestown was just how incredibly unprepared and unsuited they were to be colonists in the New World. Remember, this was essentially a get rich quick scheme."
Social Studies,"Well, who are the sort of people who'd like to get rich quick? Investors, for the most part."
Social Studies,"These were gentlemen, and the English definition of a gentleman is really someone who has title, someone who has status, someone who does not work with his hands, and all through that first summer when they probably should've been planting crops to try to survive through the winter, instead, these gentlemen were busy looking for gold, which means that when winter rolled around, things got pretty dire at Jamestown, and we'll talk about that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"Now, if you think about people in this time period, they in England are taking a look over at Spain and seeing Spain bring ships full of gold and silver back to Europe from the New World, and they wanna get in on that action. And as far as they know, the whole New World is just piled up with silver and gold. So in the first months, they sent gentlemen, and the English definition of a gentleman here is someone who does not work with his hands, to try to find gold in Virginia."
Social Studies,"Now, spoiler alert, there is no gold in Virginia. But that whole first summer, when they were there, they could have been planting crops, they could have been fishing, I mean this is actually a pretty bountiful area when it comes to natural resources in plants and animals. But they were trying to find gold, they were trying to basically get rich quick, this was the scheme. But then winter rolled around."
Social Studies,"Those who hadn't already been killed by mosquito-borne illnesses, like malaria or yellow fever, were now subject to starvation. And there the story gets even more complicated, because the English settlers, who were all men, by the way, they were adventurers, they were not there to start families, start a long-term colony in the New World, they just wanted to find gold and get out. So as these English colonists are starving, they start to run afoul of local Native Americans."
Social Studies,"There were an Algonquian tribe living in the Virginia tidewater, who were under the rule of this man here. This is a drawing of him done by John Smith, who we'll talk about in a second. His name was Powhatan. His real name was Wahunsunacawh, but the English called him Powhatan, and the people that he ruled, the Powhatans."
Social Studies,"And as the English settlers realized that they had not put away enough for practically any stores to get them through the winter, they started raiding the food supplies of the Powhatans, which, of course, didn't make them very happy, they were also trying to survive the winter. Then the Powhatans kidnapped John Smith, and there's an engraving of him here. Uh, and they kinda tried to show him their power. So there's a legend that Powhatan was intending to execute John Smith."
Social Studies,"The daughter of Powhatan, Pocahontas also wasn't her real name, that was her nickname, it kinda meant little playful person. Her real name was Matoaka, but we know her today by her nickname, Pocahontas. And Pocahontas intervened and kept her father from executing John Smith, either out of the goodness of her heart or maybe because she had a crush on him. This is pretty much completely untrue. The Disney version of this story says that Pocahontas and John Smith go on to fall in love and get married."
Social Studies,"The fact of the matter was that Pocahontas was probably about 13 years old at the time. And she will go on to marry an Englishman, but not John Smith, John Rolfe, who is famous in another way, which we'll get to soon. It's also quite likely that Powhatan didn't actually intend to execute Smith."
Social Studies,"Instead, what he was doing was kind of a ritual of power and mercy, so he's doing kind of a mock execution, saying, ""All right, I have the power to execute you."" But then, Pocahontas, playing her ritual role, steps in to say, ""No, have mercy."" So he says, you know, ""I could kill you ""because I'm a strong leader, ""but because I an also a merciful and just leader, ""I will not."" So after his kidnapping, John Smith really kinda steps up as the savior of Jamestown, which probably would have completely collapsed were it not for him."
Social Studies,"And in 1608, he takes over and says that, ""He who shall not work shall not eat."" So you gotta pull your weight if you're gonna get supported by the rest of the colonists. Nevertheless, the first years at Jamestown were pretty rough. In the winter of 1609 to 1610, which they called the starving time, the colonists were so hungry that they resorted to eating vermin, and they resorted to eating each other. One man actually killed and ate his wife in one of the few known examples of English cannibalism."
Social Studies,"So Jamestown was a pretty rough place to be. Only about 15% of the settlers who went to Jamestown actually survived. In fact, that following spring of 1610, they decided to give up and head back to England. They were met, just as they were leaving, by new supply ships that continued the Virginia experiment, which will become much more successful after the discovery of tobacco. We'll get to that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"And these new orders were carried by a new commander, here this was Lord De La Warr. Spelled a little bit different, but the state of Delaware today is named after this gentleman. And Lord De La Warr said, ""Well, it's been great ""that you've all been trying to get along ""with these Powhatans, but let's get rid of them."" So he switched the English from their small amount of conflict with the Native Americans over stealing food, to a pretty much all-out war of extinction against the Powhatans."
Social Studies,"And De La Warr was a veteran of the Irish campaigns to subdue that colony. So he brings his tactics of complete brutality and submission of the native population to the New World. He raids Native American villages. He burns their crops, and generally promotes an idea that they'll be no such thing as peaceful co-existence between English settlers and Native Americans. That the only thing for Native Americans to do is go away or die."
Social Studies,"And these conflicts between the English colonists and the Native Americans living in this Virginia tidewater are called the Anglo-Powhatan Wars. The first Anglo-Powhatan war ended in 1614 with a brief period of peace, when this fellow here, John Rolfe married Pocahontas. As kind of a peace offering."
Social Studies,"But, by the time that the second Anglo-Powhatan war was over in 1625, pretty much the entire Powhatan tribe had either been killed, or driven from the area, and therefore this English war of extinction against Native Americans had succeeded. Now John Rolfe made another contribution to the colony at Jamestown, beyond his marriage with Pocahontas, he also discovered that tobacco was a perfect crop for the kind of marshy Virginia soil."
Social Studies,"And tobacco was a commodity that was getting hotter and hotter in Europe, and so they discovered that they could grow pretty much as much tobacco as they possibly could, and markets in Europe would just buy it and buy it and buy it. And so, although the colonists at Jamestown didn't find the gold that they were hoping for, they found a very different way to get rich, and that was through cultivating tobacco."
Social Studies,"And this is going to have enormous consequences for the development of Virginia as a colony, both in terms of its geographic development, and also the development of its labor force. As tobacco is an incredibly labor-intensive crop, these English planters in Virginia will quickly look for ways to staff a labor force in the New World. And one way that they will do this is through the importation of African slaves. The very first slave ship arrived in Jamestown in 1619."
Social Studies,We'll talk more about that in the next video..
Social Studies,"So even though they didn't find gold in Virginia, they found something that was almost as good and that was a luxury commodity that people in Europe were very eager to buy. But, tobacco was incredibly labor-intensive to grow and process. So, in this video, let's talk a little bit more about what that need for labor meant as the Virginia colony began to grow. Now in the last video, I mentioned that the very first ship bearing enslaved Africans arrived in Jamestown in 1619."
Social Studies,"So, just twelve years after Jamestown was founded Africans had been brought to the area. So this shows that enslaved Africans were some of the very first people who weren't of native origin in the new world and would help shape the English colonies pretty much from the very start."
Social Studies,"But even though there were enslaved Africans in Virginia that early, the system of broad race-based slavery that will really characterize the American South up until the Civil War didn't get started right away and there were a couple of reasons for that. One was, as we mentioned many times, it was not particularly healthy to live in this area. You can see here, this is pretty much all a giant swamp,."
Social Studies,"To this day some people joke that one of the reasons that Washington DC was founded here in this area of Virginia is that it is so unpleasant to be there, they thought it would keep the American government smaller because legislators wouldn't actually want to go to the Capitol. So a pretty good number of people who came to the new world in the early years died of mosquito borne diseases. So swamp, standing water, mosquitoes, leads to epidemics."
Social Studies,"So, say I'm an English planter, and I want to plant a lot of tobacco, many acres of tobacco. So I'm going to need some people to help me. Now I have some choices. I could purchase an enslaved African person, from one of these ships, and that might cost me hundreds of pounds. Slaves are pretty expensive, and since it's such an unhealthy environment in this area, there is a reasonable chance that any person that I purchase might die within a year or so, and then I'd lose my investment."
Social Studies,"So, this is a pretty cruel and terrible form of economics, but if you're a planter in this time period, this is exactly how you're thinking. Now, my other option for help is to bring over white laborers from England and these are called indentured servants."
Social Studies,"So, perhaps there is a young man living in London, he has lots of older brothers, so he's not going to inherit anything, he doesn't have much in the way of economic opportunity, so he thinks I could go for a new start, in the New World, but I don't have the money to pay my passage on a ship across the Atlantic."
Social Studies,"So, what the planters would do, is they would say, alright, I will pay your fare across the Atlantic, and maybe that's 15 pounds, say, and in exchange you will work for me for a period of, say three to seven years. Some indentures were shorter than that, some were longer, but this is kind of a general guideline of how long they might work. And at the end of that three years, you will get land of your own and I'll give you some tools and clothes. Things you need to succeed."
Social Studies,"And then you can be your own planter. So this was a pretty good investment, if you were a young person without many opportunities in England. There's only one problem and it's the same problem we've been talking about all along, is that this is a swamp full of mosquitoes and you are quite likely to die in Virginia. So this actually turned out to be a pretty good deal for the planters who were there early. They also took advantage of something called the headright system."
Social Studies,"Which meant that they got 50 acres of land in Virginia, and of course this is just Native Americans land that they're just appropriating for themselves, but that's a whole separate issue. So you got 50 acres more land, every time you brought one person over from England. So if you could afford to bring more and more of these indentured servants over from England, you could amass huge, huge amounts of property. Just gigantic tobacco plantations."
Social Studies,"And in early on in the history of indentured servitude, very few of the servants, a pretty small percentage, actually lived to finish their indenture and to make good on this promise of land for themselves and tools and clothes to get started. So this very quickly, begins to build a social structure in Virginia, where there are few planters, who are extremely wealthy, who own lots of land and then there's everybody else."
Social Studies,"There's a large number of indentured servants, who've only been there for a couple of years, who may or may not live to see out the end of their indenture. So this is kind of a large lower class and then there are a handful of small farmers who managed to live through their period of indenture and are now getting started on their own and then there's just a tiny smattering of enslaved Africans, so just a few slaves in Virginia. This is in the early years of the 1600s."
Social Studies,"So how do we get from a world where the vast majority of workers in the southern part of what will become the United States, are white, to a world where the vast majority of people working on plantations were enslaved black Africans. We'll talk more about that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"And these indentured servants would come from England, and the planter that they proposed to work for would pay their passage across the Atlantic. And in exchange the servant would agree to work for that planter for a period of three to seven years. And this is an example of what one of these indentures might have looked like. It's in old-timey writing, so it's a little hard to see, but here you can see that there's three years is the amount of time that this person promises. This is from Pennsylvania."
Social Studies,"Kinda gives you a good sense of how someone would say, ""Alright I'm gonna work for this person for this long, ""in exchange for my passage, ""and it's a contract."" And this was a pretty good deal for planters because for every person that they brought over from England, they got another 50 acres of land, meaning that if you had the money to bring over quite a few servants, you could expand your landholdings very fast."
Social Studies,"And the other good thing about this, at least in terms of the planters was that these indentured servants had a pretty high rate of death. It was not healthy to live in this swampy area of Virginia. So quite frequently, planters didn't actually have to make good on their promise to set these indentured servants up with some land of their own, some tools to work it, because they didn't survive through their indenture."
Social Studies,"So if this system of indentured servitude, and the headright system that gave planters more land for bringing over more servants, was working out so well for them, why did African slavery become the dominant form of labor in Virginia, starting about 1700? Now when we think about tobacco cultivation, and later, cotton cultivation, in the American south before the Civil War, what we think of is enslaved African laborers."
Social Studies,"And indeed, by the year 1700, about 15% of the population living in Virginia was enslaved Africans, going from just a handful at the beginning of the century. So what caused this incredible transition in not only labor, but also racism, to happen in early America? Well there's one major event that historians tend to point to as a turning point in American slavery. And that is the rebellion led by Nathaniel Bacon in 1676. So let's talk a little bit more about that."
Social Studies,"So to understand Bacon's rebellion, we have to backtrack a little bit, and talk about the development of political power and tobacco in Virginia. So in 1619, the Virginia Company established the first government in Virginia. It was called the House of Burgesses. And this is really important because it is, in effect, the first at least semi-democratic form of government in the new world. In a way, it's kind of like a parliament that was set up for Virginia so that they could debate local issues."
Social Studies,"And it's going to be the House of Burgesses and its later House of Delegates that ends up leading the charge for the American Revolution more than a century later than this. But as we think about the way that political power was distributed in Virginia, you can guess who might have a lot of say in the House of Burgesses, and these are the tobacco planters. So the government of Virginia, although it is a democracy of these land-owning men, is still got most of the power at the very top."
Social Studies,"'Cause as we talked about in the last video, the power system in Virginia looked like a handful of planters at the top, a very small number of free white farmers who had their own land, but nothing like the gigantic tracts of tobacco plantations that the planters had, then a whole lot of white indentured servants, who have very little political power, since they are at basically the mercy of the planters. And then, just a tiny handful of black slaves."
Social Studies,"And in this time period, white indentured servants and black slaves, black free people, also a tiny number, didn't have that much difference when it came to political rights. In fact, white indentured servants frequently complained that they felt that slaves were treated better than them. Which may have been the case, because they were worth more."
Social Studies,"Remember they were worth hundreds of pounds, whereas white indentured servants cost just a couple of pounds to come over, frequently died, so they were less of an investment than slaves. The other important factor here is just what it takes to grow tobacco. Tobacco is a labor-intensive crop, we know, but it's also kind of a crop that is extremely hard on the soil. It depletes the soil fast. Which means that there is a constant need for new soil."
Social Studies,"And when you're coming from the coast, here's our Atlantic Ocean over here, and this is Virginia, and our Jamestown colony along the River James, more and more planters, as they come over, remember we have this headright system, we have a system that says that if indentured servants finish out the terms of their indenture, they get land of their own, means there is constant pressure to add more and more land so you can farm more and more tobacco. And you start going farther and farther into the interior."
Social Studies,"So what does this mean? It means that land becomes relatively scarce pretty fast. And it also means that as white settlers continue to move west toward the Appalachian mountains, which are over here, I hope you enjoy this beautiful map, it's certainly a work of art, they are running up against more and more anger and conflict with Native Americans who are living in between the coast and the Appalachian mountains."
Social Studies,"And now it's definitely in the interest of the House of Burgesses, the government here at Jamestown, to make sure that there is as little conflict with Native Americans as possible. Remember we had these wars of extinction with the Powhatans. That wasn't a fun time for anyone. And so the House of Burgesses, which is now somewhat responsible to the King of England, since he acquired it from the Virginia Company as a royal colony in 1624, they have a relatively friendly attitude toward the Native Americans."
Social Studies,"They're hoping to avoid conflict. And so their governor, Governor William Berkeley, spelled Berkeley but pronounced Barkley, I don't know why. He refuses to take on another war of extinction against the Native Americans, which makes a lot of white servants and white freeman pretty angry. It's the late 1600s now, and more and more of these indentured servants are living to finish out their terms of indenture."
Social Studies,"They have now built up some immunity to these diseases that have killed so many other people in Virginia. And they're finding it really hard to make a living because the planters don't want to give quite so many rights, quite so many perks, to people who live out their indentures. Remember this was a good deal for planters when these white servants never actually survived to make good on the promises of land."
Social Studies,"And now that they are, planters don't want to extend them things like a promise of land, because land is already scarce. So when servants are finishing up their indentures, they're finding it difficult to make a living. They often have to continue to work for the planter they had been indentured to for very small wages, they don't have land of their own, they can't get started. And this is a world composed almost entirely of men, so they can't even find women to marry."
Social Studies,"And I think if there's anything we've learned from U.S. history, it's that you never want a whole lot of unemployed, angry, young men hanging about, because young men with a lot of time on their hands get up to trouble. And one young man in particular was this fellow here, Nathaniel Bacon, who was incensed at Governor Berkeley's refusal to take a harsher stance against the Native Americans on the west, where all of these white farmers wished that they could settle."
Social Studies,"And so he gets up a militia, full of young white men, and also African American men, to actually go after the Native Americans. So this is a biracial raid force for Native Americans, and they raid Native American villages, and kill many Native Americans living in the area, and Governor Berkeley wants them to stop. And instead of stopping, they marched to Jamestown, the capital of Virginia, and set it on fire."
Social Studies,"So this is a group of landless white men, landless African American men, who have rebelled against the government of Virginia. These are my flames, the House of Burgesses. They run Berkeley out of town. And it's hard to know where this would have ended, because Nathaniel Bacon himself died. And he died of illness, like many other Virginians in this time period, so the rebellion kind of petered out without his leadership."
Social Studies,"But clearly this was a really scary moment for the House of Burgesses, and for the leaders and planters in Virginia. And they started to think, alright well maybe this indentured servitude thing isn't working out so well, because once these indentures are up, we've got this whole set of landless free whites who technically have the rights of Englishmen, but we have little work for them, we have little land for them, and it's going to end up with constant rebellion."
Social Studies,So maybe we should think about a different source of labor. One that will never get its freedom. And it just so happened that there were many such laborers for sale on the coast of west Africa. And we'll talk more about that in the next video..
Social Studies,"Because even though this was quite a gigantic swath of territory, these tiny little islands in the Caribbean were incredibly profitable for English investors. Because sugar was a commodity that fetched very high prices in the Colonial Era. In this video I want to focus on the southern colonies and the British colonies in the Caribbean, which although they were somewhat separated in land. Got them next to each other here, but kinda imagine that this is the tip of Florida."
Social Studies,"So that belongs down here, and all these little islands in the Caribbean are far to the south of mainland North America. So what united these colonies, even though they were divided in geography, is that they were plantation colonies. They were in southern or tropical regions, which meant that they had long growing seasons that made them ideal for planting cash crops. That is crops that are specifically grown to be sold."
Social Studies,"Now we've already talked a little bit about the crops of Virginia, which would be tobacco, but in this video I want to talk a little bit more about two other crops. Sugar, which was grown in the Caribbean, and rice, which was grown in the Carolinas. Growing these cash crops for export was the main focus of these colonies, and their social structures were organized around producing those cash crops. So let's talk bout sugar."
Social Studies,"Now we hardly think about consuming sugar in our tea or coffee today, but in the Colonial Era it was an incredible luxury and it commanded very high prices. One of the reasons for this is because sugar was extremely labor intensive to make. The sugarcane plant is actually indigenous to Asia, but Europeans brought it to the New World with the hopes of turning it into a cash crop."
Social Studies,"They planted it in the tropical areas of the Caribbean and then they imported enslaved Africans to work on their sugar plantations. Now you can see a little bit in these two prints of what sugar processing was like. You would have to grow the cane stalks, press the juice from them, boil the juice until it created crystals. Sugar processing happened 24/7, and unlike tobacco you really had to be very wealthy to grow sugar because it required a huge capital investment upfront."
Social Studies,"You had to buy a lot of land and grow a lot of sugarcane and get a lot of machinery if you hoped to produce enough to make a profit. So a handful of very wealthy plantation owners, who mostly stayed in England because the tropical diseases of the Caribbean were too likely to kill them off. These sugar barons had unimaginable wealth. The tobacco planters of Virginia were nothing compared to them. And they were ruthless about turning a profit."
Social Studies,"In fact they thought that it would be more profitable in the event of the deaths of enslaved people from overwork or disease or some kind of accident in sugar processing, to just replace enslaved workers rather than make their work less dangerous. Growing sugar was so profitable that the Caribbean islands, which were so small, couldn't even spare room to grow food. They imported all their food from elsewhere so that every square inch of arable land in the Caribbean could be used to grow sugar."
Social Studies,"Now with so many enslaved people coming into the Caribbean, by the mid 1600s, enslaved Africans in the Caribbean far outnumbered white people. And consequently the white slave owners became increasingly fearful of slave uprisings. So plantation owners who were, of course, in control of the colonial government began to crack down on enslaved people, codifying the racial status of enslaved Africans. In 1661, Barbados passed a slave code that was incredibly harsh."
Social Studies,"I won't go into all of it here but the gist of it was that the lives of enslaved Africans were to be very closely monitored. They would require passes to travel. They had no legal rights. And if a slave owner maimed or killed an enslaved person there would be no repercussions for that violence or death. We will see aspects of the Barbados Slave Act in the statutes passed in the southern mainland colonies, and later southern states in the United states."
Social Studies,"And although we tend to think of plantation slavery generally looking like the slavery we would see later in Georgia or South Carolina, large cotton plantations, for the vast majority of enslaved Africans, their experience would have been much more like what we saw in the Caribbean. In fact, 90 percent of all enslaved people were sent to the Caribbean or South America. Only a little over 300,000 would be sent to mainland North America."
Social Studies,"So if you're looking for the most typical experience of slavery from the point of view of the people who lived it, life on the sugar plantation was a much more likely prospect than life on a cotton plantation. In fact it was English planters in the Caribbean who decided that they might strike north to create a new plantation colony, which they called Carolina after the English King Charles."
Social Studies,"Now Carolina was founded as one big colony in 1670, but by 1712 it was separated into two colonies, North Carolina and South Carolina. And the wealthy plantation owners who founded Charles Town, also named after King Charles, brought most of the aspects of plantation slavery they had picked up in the Caribbean with them. The Pass System, the lack of legal rights, the lack of repercussions for whites."
Social Studies,"One main difference, however, was that in the Carolinas rice cultivation took the place of sugar cultivation as the main cash crop. Plantation owners quickly discovered that many West Africans had worked on their own rice farms before enslavement. And so they particularly wished to purchase West Africans to work on rice plantations. This is an image here of a rice plantation."
Social Studies,"Obviously, this a photograph, so it would be from a couple hundred years after the settlement of the Carolinas, but I think it gives you a sense of what rice cultivation looked like. I want to finish by just briefly talking about the colonies of Maryland and Georgia, which were also plantation colonies. But I've grouped them together because they were both founded for altruistic reasons."
Social Studies,"They were proprietary colonies originally like Pennsylvania, for example, meaning that they were the possessions of one person rather than a company or the crown. Maryland was founded in 1632 by an English catholic named Lord Baltimore who wanted to create a haven of religious freedom for Catholics in North America. In 1649, Maryland passed the law concerning religion, also known as the Maryland Act of Toleration, which extended religious toleration to everyone who believed in Jesus."
Social Studies,"So all Protestants, all Catholics, but on the flip side it prescribed death for anyone who did not believe in Jesus like Jews or Atheists. Georgia was founded a century later in 1732 by an English humanitarian named James Oglethorpe. And Oglethorpe was trying to reform prisons. In England people who couldn't pay their debts were thrown into debtors' prison, which was kind of silly because when they were in prison they didn't have the opportunity to try to make money to pay back their debts."
Social Studies,"So Oglethorpe founded the colony of Georgia with the idea that people who were suffering from debt could go to this new colony and work it off. And for that reason he also outlawed slavery in the early years of Georgia's existence, but by about 1750 the pressure to include slaves in the Georgia economy so that it could keep up with South Carolina, for example, grew too great. And so slavery was permitted."
Social Studies,"So although the colonies of the West Indies and the southern part of North America were in different places and sometimes founded for different reasons, they were all united by the fact that they relied on slavery, and in many cases had a much larger enslaved African population than white population. And they focused for their economies on plantation agriculture."
Social Studies,"Now you'll notice that in this video I haven't spent much time talking about the experiences of enslaved African people, and that's because I want to devote another video to that. So check out our video on Atlantic slavery.."
Social Studies,"In fact, all British colonies had some amount of slavery and all British colonies had some involvement in the institution of slavery, whether that was bankrolling it as a financier, growing food that was intended for the slave colonies in the West Indies that didn't want to spare even an acre of land to grow something other than sugar, or shipping enslaved Africans by either owning or captaining the boats of the middle passage."
Social Studies,"In fact, one of the largest ports where slaves entered the North American colonies and were sold at auction was at Newport, Rhode Island. But despite this, the largest share of enslaved people were in the southern colonies, which focused on plantation agriculture. So, Maryland, Virginia, and then even farther south into the British colonies in the Caribbean. In some of these southernmost colonies, you can see that enslaved Africans outnumbered white people by sometimes quite a considerable amount."
Social Studies,"As the enslaved population in the colonies grew, colonial governments began passing more and more restrictions on the lives of enslaved people and began codifying who was or was not a slave. For example, if a white man and an enslaved woman had a child together, would that child be free like her father or enslaved like her mother? What about the opposite case? In Virginia in 1662, the government passed a law specifying that the children of enslaved women would follow the condition of their mothers."
Social Studies,"Other laws prevented interracial relationships and defined enslaved Africans as chattel slaves, which means personal property, and as the personal property of slave owners, enslaved people had little to no legal rights. So, over the course of the 1600s, slavery became stricter and more exclusively defined by race. The experience of being enslaved was unimaginably physically and emotionally taxing."
Social Studies,"Since enslaved people had no legal protections, owners could maim or even kill enslaved people with little to no repercussion. For women, life in slavery also meant the constant threat and frequent reality of rape at the hands of slave owners."
Social Studies,"Religion, dance, music, and family helped enslaved people deal with the harsh realities of everyday life and enslaved people also developed both covert means of resisting slavery, like, for example, breaking tools, which made it more difficult to work, or overt means of resisting slavery, particularly in slave uprisings. One of these, the Stono Rebellion in 1739 in South Carolina resulted in the deaths of about 42 whites and about 44 blacks."
Social Studies,"The South Carolina government responded to the rebellion by making slave codes even harsher. I wanna finish by just reiterating how central the institution of slavery was to not just some, but all of the English colonies. In the 19th century, Americans would refer to slavery as the peculiar institution, meaning not so much that it was strange, but that it was specific to the south part of the United States."
Social Studies,"But slavery really wasn't specific to the south part, it was the bedrock of the colonial economy, not just in the south, but in all the industries that contributed to slavery in the north as well, those who financed, fed, shipped, and even bought the products made by enslaved people created the economic prosperity of the North American colonies.."
Social Studies,And I think both of these stories tells us a little bit about the founding mythology of the United States.
Social Studies,"Were the original settlers here looking for religious freedom or were they here looking to make a quick buck? Well, in this video I'd like to take some time to explore the New England colonies, the story of the people who landed at Plymouth Rock and then later, at Boston, to begin the colony of Massachusetts Bay and we'll see as we go along, just how different the settlers in Massachusetts Bay were from those at Jamestown and also some of the ways in which they were quite similar."
Social Studies,"Now, there's no question about who got here first. As you can see, Jamestown was founded in 1607, but it wasn't too much later that the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620, and then they were followed by a much larger group of Puritans, who landed at Boston and founded Massachusetts Bay in 1630. So let's talk about Puritans."
Social Studies,"So who or what was a Puritan? This is an image of Cotton Mather, he was a prominent Puritan minister, fact the Mather family will go on to be one of the great theological families of Massachusetts."
Social Studies,"Puritans started in England and their main concern was that they believed the Church of England, the Anglican Church, was too much like the Catholic Church and this is a fairly legitimate criticism, because in many ways, the Anglican Church was very similar to the Catholic Church, except that instead of being headed by the Pope, the Church of England was led by the king. So Puritans hoped that they could purify the Church of England from its many Catholic influences."
Social Studies,"So that's where Puritan comes from, purify, and by this, they meant that there were too many rituals, too much pomp and circumstance, and not enough focus on the Bible itself. So they kind of wanted to strip away a lot of the fanciness of the Church of England. In the 1620s, the Puritans began to face more persecution in England."
Social Studies,"Now, why did the English government care about a group of religious folks who were not big fans of the Church of England? Well the answer is, that there was no separation of church and state and so as the king was the head of the church, if you're casting doubt on the church, you are then casting doubt on the king and so the Puritans did not make themselves very popular in England and sensing that they might be in trouble, many Puritans began to emigrate to the new world."
Social Studies,"They'd seen lots of tracts about Virginia and how one could make a new life there and they thought that perhaps, if they went to Virginia and they were originally aiming to go to Virginia, they ended up landing a bit north of there, that they could set an example of what a righteous church and a righteous society would look like, because they believed that the church and the society of England were becoming much too corrupt, much too divorced from the principles of the Bible."
Social Studies,"So in 1620, one group of Puritans set out for the new world and landed at Plymouth Rock and we call them the Pilgrims, and then in 1630, a second group set out and they were just Puritans more broadly. And over the course of the 1630s, about 14,000 Puritans emigrated from England to New England, Massachusetts Bay, in what's called the great migration."
Social Studies,"So what was the difference between these two groups, The Pilgrims and the Puritans? Well, the Pilgrims who arrived in 1620, they were separatists and what that means is that they thought that the Church of England was so corrupt that there was just no chance that they were going to be able to save it. So they wanted to separate from that church altogether and live a completely separate life at Plymouth."
Social Studies,"They had a pretty small settlement, about a hundred people crossed over on the Mayflower, the ship that brought them to the New World, but the group that came over in 1630, the Puritans, they did not want to separate from the Church of England altogether. They wanted to purify it and they hoped that by setting an example of a righteous society, they would actually convince people back in England to adopt their ways, invite them back, and that all of England could become like New England."
Social Studies,"This man here is John Winthrop and he was a lawyer who became a leader of the Puritans, he was elected governor pretty much for his entire life and he wrote that he wanted Massachusetts Bay to be like a city upon a hill and be a kind of a beacon of light, showing the world what a good society could be like."
Social Studies,"Now, obviously the New England Puritans did not get their way, they were not invited back to England to become the model of English society, but they did become the model of society in Massachusetts Bay and New England, more generally, and I think a strong influence on American culture, writ large. So how did life in New England compare to life in Virginia? Well, a lot depended on the different environment of the colony and the reasons that migrants came to New England."
Social Studies,"Because the environment of New England was colder, the land was rockier, it was both a healthier place to live, because tropical diseases couldn't flourish there the way that they could in the marshy areas of Virginia and it was also the unsuitable place for large-scale plantation agriculture. So they couldn't grow the kinds of crops that Virginia grew, like tobacco or even sugar in the West Indies."
Social Studies,"So that meant that in New England, most of the industry was either family farming and fishing and also some trading, since they were on the coast. And because most Puritans came over to help build this city upon a hill, they came in family units, not as single men, like in Virginia, so there was a much more even ratio of men to women."
Social Studies,"The families that came over tended to be well-off enough to pay their own passage across the Atlantic, tended to be kind of middle-class, artisan types and so New England didn't have the kind of influx of indentured servants that Virginia had, nor did it have an influx of enslaved Africans as laborers, because most New Englanders were farmers and they were small farmers, so they relied on their own family as labor."
Social Studies,"So a major consequence of these motivations for emigrating and this environment, was that New England society was relatively egalitarian. There were very few very wealthy landowners, like there were in Virginia, and very few people who were completely at the bottom, like servants and enslaved people."
Social Studies,"People who lived in Virginia had a life expectancy of up to 70 years, which was one of the highest life expectancies in the world at this time and because reading the Bible so important to the Puritans, New England also had one of the highest rates of literacy in the world at this time, but for all of these positives, there were plenty of reasons why living in New England wasn't so much fun. Most of them related to the strictness of the Congregational Church."
Social Studies,"Puritans canceled Christmas, that they thought was too much of a pagan ritual and though you would think that their own experience of religious intolerance in England would have led them to be more tolerant to dissidents, that was not the case. Anyone who disagreed with a Puritan theology or leadership, was given the option to go somewhere else or be executed."
Social Studies,"For example, Roger Williams, who questioned the Puritans' actions toward Native Americans was expelled from Massachusetts Bay in 1636 and he went on to found the colony of Rhode Island, where religious dissenters could find a place of refuge from Massachusetts Bay, just as the people of Massachusetts Bay had found refuge from England. One of these was a woman named Anne Hutchinson, who in 1637, was expelled from Massachusetts Bay for daring to be a woman who preached the Bible."
Social Studies,"So in this video, I've explored some of the background to Puritans and Pilgrims and aspects of New England society and religion. In the next video, we'll continue our exploration of New England's life through its politics and policies toward Native Americans.."
Social Studies,"Now, when the pilgrims first came over on the Mayflower, they agreed in what was called the Mayflower Compact to kind of work together and hold each other in mutual esteem. And some people say that this is one of the first founding documents showing democracy in the New World. New Englanders, like Virginians, were very far from the mother country and they had to fend for themselves."
Social Studies,"So, English colonists learned to make decisions by themselves, 'cause asking for help from across the ocean wasn't very easy and took a really long time. So, because England was so far away and really not paying much attention to the American colonies at all, there was a tradition of self-government among English colonists. But what was different about democracy in New England than democracy in Virginia was that most people in New England were middle class. They were small farmers."
Social Studies,"Most people were about the same social station and that meant that they were used to having about the same amount of political power. So, in New England, most towns had town meetings where the men of the town would gather to solve local problems. Now, this was, of course, a very limited democracy where only white men have a say, but for the era of the 1600s, it was very democratic indeed."
Social Studies,"For all the ways that New England and Virginia were very different, there was one way in which they were virtually identical and that was their treatment of Native Americans. Just as early compromise and cooperation with the Powhatan tribe turned into the English attempting to eradicate Native Americans from the eastern seaboard, New Englanders originally cooperated with local Algonquian tribes like the Wampanoags or Narragansett Indians."
Social Studies,"But as English demands for more land and more food began to disrupt Native ways of life, relationships soured and cultural misunderstandings between the two groups soon led to outright war. When English settlers made treaties with Native Americans asking for land, Native Americans thought that they were asking for the rights to hunt on that land, not the rights to fence in that land and not allow Native Americans on it."
Social Studies,"So, because English ideas of property did not align with Native ideas of property, soon, when Native Americans went to hunt on their traditional lands, they found the English prosecuting them as intruders. And because Algonquians practiced Three Sisters farming where corn, beans, and squash were grown together, English people, who separated all their crops, didn't recognize that those fields were actually Native agriculture and allowed their cattle and pigs to roam through them, destroying Native crops."
Social Studies,"With so much pressure on their source of food, Native people began to lash out at English people who thought of themselves as the victims of senseless Indian attacks. By 1675, many tribes in the area decided to work together to oust the English led by a man named Metacom. In fact, I think Metacom was only one of the leaders, but the English called him King Phillip and believed that he was the instigator of this war. So, in 1675, Metacom and other groups began to attack English villages."
Social Studies,"But in 1676, the English recruited Indian allies of their own and turned the tide, so that by the end of 1676, about 3,000 Native Americans had died to about 1,000 English. And those that were remaining, the English either executed or sold into slavery. So, in this way, they were not very different from the English people of Virginia at all. Metacom's war, like the Anglo-Powhatan Wars in Virginia, really marked the end of Native American resistance to English colonization on the east coast."
Social Studies,Survivors fled further inland or north and joined other tribes that continued to resist the English for many decades to come. I wanna finish by just briefly summarizing some of the similarities and differences between English settlement in New England and English settlement in the Chesapeake Bay that we've been talking about throughout these videos.
Social Studies,"Here, I've just made a quick chart comparing some of the aspects that we've talked about, and, as I see it, there are three real differences between New England and the Chesapeake, and two real similarities. Now, one thing that was really different between them was just their environment. New England was far north of the Chesapeake, so it was much colder and rockier, which didn't permit the settlers of New England to conduct plantation agriculture at a large scale like we did in the Chesapeake."
Social Studies,"So, instead, they had small family farms, they fished. Compared to the Chesapeake Bay where although it was very hot and marshy, not a healthy environment at all, it was, with its very long growing seasons, a great place for plantation agriculture, particularly growing tobacco. Another major difference between the two regions was who came to each of these places and why. In New England, settlers came for religious freedom for the most part."
Social Studies,"Puritans attempting to escape persecution in England hoped that they could set up their Puritan city on a hill in Massachusetts Bay. So, consequently, they were middle class families who came as a family unit. They had a lot more women in New England than they did in the Chesapeake, which meant that their natural rate of growth was going to be higher, because they could have more families and more families could have more children."
Social Studies,"In the Chesapeake, by contrast, most settlers were single men who were coming to seek their fortune, either white men, often as indentured servants, or enslaved Africans who were forced to migrate to the Chesapeake Bay to labor in tobacco plantations. So, there were fewer women and the kind of rate of population growth really only depended on more and more people immigrating as the unhealthy environment led to quite a bit of death from tropical disease."
Social Studies,The last major difference I see is in the labor systems of each of these regions and the kinds of class systems that they generated.
Social Studies,"In the Chesapeake Bay, as a group of early planters became more and more prosperous and brought in more and more enslaved laborers, there was a great disparity of wealth, as the poorest were at the bottom of the social hierarchy, including enslaved people, indentured servants, a few small farmers who were independent and had made it, and then, at the very top, the tobacco planters who held most of the wealth, but made up, really, quite a small percentage of the population."
Social Studies,"In comparison, people in New England had a general equality of wealth, meaning that most people were small farmers getting by comfortably. There weren't many people who were at a distant top of the social hierarchy and not that many people who were stuck at the very bottom. Most people in New England were middle class, but there were some similarities between New England and the Chesapeake. In both of these regions, local government was unusually democratic for the era."
Social Studies,"In New England, the citizens of a town would meet in town meetings to discuss local issues and pretty much all white men had a say in those meetings. In the Chesapeake, there were also local assemblies like the House of Burgesses in Virginia. And although most of these democratic institutions were dominated by elites, these elected assemblies were still considerably more democratic than the monarchy of England."
Social Studies,"And the last way that New England and the Chesapeake were quite similar to each other were in their attitudes toward Native Americans. In both New England and the Chesapeake, the English carried on wars of extinction against local Native American tribes, whether it was the Wampanoags in Metacom's war, or the Powhatans in the Anglo-Powhatan Wars. English colonists simply could not imagine a world in which they coexisted peacefully with Native Americans or in any way incorporated them into their societies."
Social Studies,"Now, I started this video series with a question about who was the real spiritual ancestor of the United States."
Social Studies,"Was it the New England colonies with their pilgrims and search for religious freedom, or was it the Chesapeake colonies with their search to find fortune? Well, perhaps the evidence that we've taken a look at here has persuaded you one way or another, but myself, I think, that comparing the two of them, we can see that, in many ways, English colonization was directly impacted by the environment and by the individuals who came to each of these settlements."
Social Studies,"But there are some larger trends about English settlement. In both the cases of the New England colonies and the Chesapeake colonies, English people who came to the New World had unusually democratic forms of government. They were independent, used to taking care of themselves, but they were also united with their approach to Native Americans."
Social Studies,"Unlike the Spanish, who incorporated Native Americans into society, even if at the lowest rungs, and the French or the Dutch, who cooperated very much with Native Americans, English people saw Native Americans as an obstacle and one that needed to be removed.."
Social Studies,"These colonies that were here kind of on the center of the eastern seaboard, south of Massachusetts and north of the Southern Colonies of Virginia, particularly Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and this little, tiny purple colony right here, Delaware. Now what's unique about the Middle Colonies compared to the northern or southern colonies is not just that they were kind of in a central location, but also that they were proprietary colonies, which means that they were the property of individual owners."
Social Studies,"So unlike Jamestown, for example, which was founded by a company, the Virginia Company, the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by one man, William Penn, who was granted his land by the king of England in exchange for a debt that the king had owed his father. So in the early years of these proprietary colonies, they were kind of the playgrounds of the people who owned them. They could set their own rules for the most part."
Social Studies,"And that freedom resulted in colonies that were more ethnically diverse and more religiously tolerant than their neighbors to the north or south. So let's look at the colony of Pennsylvania as an example. So Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn, and Penn was a English aristocrat from a very good family who'd converted to the Quaker religion."
Social Studies,"Although the real name for Quakers was the Religious Society of Friends, they got the nickname Quaker because they seemed to quake when they were in religious ecstasy. Like the Puritans, Quakers faced religious persecution in England because they did not follow the Church of England, which was a form of rebellion against the king who was the head of the Church of England. But in addition to the Quakers' strange ideas about religion, they also had some strange ideas for the time period about social status."
Social Studies,"Quakers believed that all people had the light of God in them and therefore were more or less equal in stature. So for example, women could preach in church, as you see in this image right here. So when William Penn converted to the Quaker faith, Penn had a really rough time of it. So he came upon an idea that perhaps he could make a haven for Quakers and for religious dissenters more broadly in the New World."
Social Studies,"So he negotiated with the king who owed his father a debt, and in exchange for this debt, the king granted Penn land in North America, which was named Pennsylvania, sylvania being Latin for forest. So kind of Penn's forest, Penn's woods. And Penn decided to extend his religious tolerance not just to Quakers, but really to all people."
Social Studies,"All Protestants, no matter what their particular sect, could have citizenship, run for office, vote, and Catholics and even Jews were welcome in Pennsylvania, although they did not have the right to vote or hold office. This was incredibly radical for the time period when it was common for nations to have a state religion and to persecute those who didn't follow that religion."
Social Studies,"Penn advertised for his new colony and particularly hoped that industrious people, people with skills like carpentry or blacksmithing, would come to Pennsylvania and make it a prosperous colony. And they did. The ease of getting citizenship, the religious tolerance, and the plentiful and cheap land of Pennsylvania drew many settlers to the colony such that its principal city, Philadelphia, was the largest city in North America before the Revolution, with about 40,000 inhabitants."
Social Studies,"Because Quakers were pacifists, that is they did not believe in violence or war, they even lived peacefully with Native Americans in the early years of Pennsylvania settlement. But as more immigrants of different faiths came to Pennsylvania and began pushing west, that short era of peaceful co-habitation ended. Likewise, because Quakers believed in the innate equality of all human beings, they were not fond of slavery."
Social Studies,"The environment in the Middle Colonies was not so cold as it was in the north, not so hot as it was in the south, it was kind of middling. And so it was a very good place for farming, particularly cereal crops like wheat. You can see this print here shows wheat growing in this field. And just as the name suggests, Pennsylvania had a lot of wood, so it was also a good place for timber. And the excellent ports at Philadelphia and New York City made it an excellent place for trade."
Social Studies,"Because it was such a good place to grow food, the Middle Colonies got the nickname the Breadbasket Colonies. And the patterns of land ownership reflect this. Since the soil was good, your average farmer owned more land than a New England farmer, but not as much as a Virginia farmer who would've had many acres to grow tobacco. So much like the environment, the farms in the Middle Colonies were middling in size."
Social Studies,"In fact, if I had to put the Middle Colonies on a spectrum, in many places I'd put them right in the middle when it came to an economy that was more agrarian. The Middle Colonies had a little bit of both, unlike the Chesapeake and southern economies which were strongly agrarian. And unlike the New England colonies who began manufacturing quite early. Likewise, when it comes to the distribution of wealth in the Middle Colonies, once again I'd put the Middle Colonies right here in the center."
Social Studies,"There were plenty of middling farmers, many indentured servants, and a handful of people who became quite wealthy, unlike the Chesapeake where there were a handful of extremely wealthy landowners while most people lived at the bottom of the social scale, and unlike New England where small farming led to a fairly even middle class."
Social Studies,"So the Middle Colonies had a mixed economy of industry and farming, and a fairly balanced class structure with people at many different levels, putting them smack dab in the middle. But for all of the ways that the Middle Colonies were middling, there were also a few ways that they were quite extraordinary. Well, we've already mentioned that the Middle Colonies had a level of religious freedom that was virtually unmatched anywhere else in the world."
Social Studies,"For example, Pennsylvania extended citizenship to all Protestants and tolerated Catholics and Jews. In comparison, the Chesapeake and Southern Colonies required citizens to belong to the Anglican faith, the Church of England, and religious tolerance for the Catholic Church in Maryland and New Englanders were extremely strict. For example, in Massachusetts Bay, anyone who was not Puritan was expelled or executed."
Social Studies,"Although there is of course the exception of Rhode Island, where religious dissenters could find safe haven. The other extraordinary aspect of these middle colonies was just the sheer amount of ethnic diversity there was. By the time of the American Revolution, less than half, only about 49% of inhabitants were from England or had an English background. The rest were German, French, Dutch, Scotch-Irish. And just a few Africans as there was relatively little slavery."
Social Studies,"In comparison, New England was perhaps the least diverse of the colonies. Most people were English, with a handful of remaining Native Americans and Africans. And the Chesapeake and Southern Colonies were largely African and English, with again just a few Native Americans. The people of the Middle Colonies spoke many languages, practiced many faiths, and had a strong possibility of upward mobility economically since farms and businesses prospered and the Middle Colonies grew rapidly in population.."
Social Studies,"They didn't, but they did find that they could grow a valuable cash crop in tobacco. Over the next century more and more English settlements began haphazardly popping up along the Atlantic seaboard of North America. Some founded as religious refuges, some as proprietary colonies, some as joint stock companies. Compared to the Spanish Empire in the New World, which had clear goals and unified colonial systems, the English Empire was pretty disorganized."
Social Studies,"Internal strife like the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution, meant that the government kept changing hands, and some monarchs took a more hands on approach towards the colonies than others. This benign neglect of the American colonies left them to develop self-government and a sense of independence. But even in the early 1770s most American colonist thought of themselves as English citizens who were part of the British Empire."
Social Studies,"They read the same books, spoke the same language, drank the same tea, and fought the same enemies as their counterparts on the British Isles. Nevertheless, there was something clearly different about the 13 colonies in North America. After all, there were more than 30 British colonies in the Caribbean and North America by 1776. So why did those 13 in particular unite and rebel? So that leaves us with a question."
Social Studies,"During this period of colonial development, how British were the American colonists? What aspects of society brought them closer with the mother country, and what aspects brought on resistance to Britain's control? Let's take a look at the major political, social and economic exchanges that took place between the British Empire and the 13 colonies, and compare whether they either brought the colonies in the mother country closer together or created resentment that drove them further apart."
Social Studies,"Okay, first let's look at the political exchanges between the colonies and England. One thing that they shared was a political culture. A shared sense that all citizens, both at home and in the colonies, enjoyed the rights of Englishmen. So I would say that the political culture that the colonies, and later the United States, inherited from England was a factor that united them with Empire."
Social Studies,"But because the colonies were far away from the mother country and because the mother country was often too distracted by its own problems to take an active role in managing them, the colonies also developed their own local representative governments. This led to a tradition of self-rule and self-taxation, and the colonists were irate any time the British colonial governors attempted to interfere with their representative bodies. So I would say this tended to divide the colonies from England."
Social Studies,"What else happened politically? Well, during this time period there was also a lot of warfare against competing colonial powers in North America, particularly France and Spain, who were supported by Native American allies. For the colonists warfare against a common enemy strengthened their sense that they belonged to the British Empire. But they also felt frustrated when they didn't receive enough help defending their settlements or when British regulars insulted their colonial militias."
Social Studies,"So these conflicts were probably both a source of unity and division between the colonists and the British Government. Next, let's look at some of the social and cultural exchanges that happened between the colonies and England during this period. A big area of cultural exchange was in religion. America became the destination of choice for religious dissenters since most of the colonies were fairly tolerant of a broad range of religions. The established Church of England was pretty weak in the colonies."
Social Studies,So religion in general didn't tie the colonies together with the mother country. But in the early 1700s both England and the colonies experienced a shared religious revival with the Great Awakening. One of the most popular preachers throughout the colonies was the English parson George Whitefield. So we might put religion down as something that both united and divided the colonies from Great Britain.
Social Studies,"Another shared cultural experience was the Enlightenment, which spread ideas about reason and self-government through books and pamphlets that were read all over the Atlantic world. Ben Franklin, the American printer and scientist, was as famous in England as he was in the colonies. So the shared ideas of the Enlightenment brought the Empire together, at least at this point. Another aspect of cultural exchange was fashion and consumer goods."
Social Studies,"The elite American colonists dressed like the English gentry, built homes in the English style, imported luxury goods from England, and drank tea like the fashionable British. So these cultural exchanges definitely were a force uniting the colonies with the mother country. Last, let's examine economic exchanges. One thing that the colonies had in common with the rest of the British Empire was their dependence on slave labor to produce cash crops."
Social Studies,"British investors and the owners of slave ships and plantations in the Caribbean were deeply involved in the system of slavery. And so were the 13 American colonies, which produced food for enslaved laborers, turned slave produced molasses into rum, and shipped enslaved people across the Atlantic, not to mention the American slave owners in the South. Slavery was central to the united economic prosperity of the British Empire."
Social Studies,"Another central aspect of the British Empire's economy was mercantilism, an economic philosophy that championed using colonies as sources of raw materials and as markets for finished goods. Mercantilism both helped and hindered the American colonies by making sure that their raw materials got preferential treatment in England, but also by preventing them from developing industries of their own. So I would say that mercantilism both united and divided the colonies from the Empire."
Social Studies,"Along with mercantilism came the Navigation Acts, a series of laws passed by Parliament that attempted to prevent the American colonies from trading with other countries. Basically a way to enforce that the benefits of mercantilism went to England alone. But there were two major problems with the Navigation Acts. First, the British Government rarely enforced them, especially when it was occupied with other matters."
Social Studies,"The other problem was that even when efforts were made to enforce the Navigation Acts, American merchants responded by smuggling and bribing officials, not by obeying the law. So the Navigation Acts worked to divide the colonies from the Empire, both because they didn't work and because they hampered American's belief in free trade. Taking a look at these three categories as a whole, you can see that the colonists had mixed feelings about their role in the British Empire."
Social Studies,In terms of social and cultural exchanges it seems like the colonies were tied into a greater world of ideas that spanned across the Atlantic. But both politically and economically there were developments that bonded the colonies closer together with Great Britain and developments that had the colonies tugging at their leashes and trying to run free. These mixed feelings might help to explain why in 1754 the colonies had not yet pursued their independence.
Social Studies,But are there some things that I've identified here as promoting unity that might not be so unifying by 1776? What changed between this point and the signing of the Declaration of Independence that pushed the colonists off the fence and into revolution?.
Social Studies,"So if you've been following along this far, you may have noticed two things. One, that the people who named this war seem to be very bad at math because 1754 to 1763 is nine years, not seven, and that this war seems to have two names, both the Seven Years' War and the French and Indian War, which is a name you perhaps have heard before. Well, lemme tackle those two oddities in reverse order. So not only does the Seven Years' War have two names, it has a whole number of names."
Social Studies,"It's called the Seven Years' War, the French and Indian War, the War of the Conquest, the Pomeranian War, the Third Silesian War, the Third Carnatic War. This is a war with a whole bunch of names, and the reason that it has a whole bunch of names is that it was fought in a whole bunch of places. The Seven Years' War was really the first global war, and we're talking 150 years before World War One."
Social Studies,"Aspects of the Seven Years' War, as you can kinda see from this map, were fought in Europe, in South America, the coast of Africa, in India, the Philippines, and of course, in North America. The many different names come from the many different fronts of this war, and I would say that French and Indian War is actually the name for the North American front of this war, or theater of this war. So there are two reasons why I think Seven Years' War is a better name than French and Indian War."
Social Studies,One is that Seven Years' War gets at the idea that it was not just happening in North America.
Social Studies,"It was happening all over the world, so it shows that it was a global war, but I also think Seven Years' War is a better name than French and Indian War because I think French and Indian War is kind of confusing because you would think that it means that the principal parties in this war were the English versus the French and the Indians, when in fact it was the English and their Indian allies versus the French and their Indian allies."
Social Studies,"Native Americans fought on both sides of this conflict, so rather than the English and Indian versus French and Indian War, let's go with the shorter Seven Years' War, which brings us back to our awkward date range. So the reason that it's called the Seven Years' War is because the English didn't actually declare war on the French until 1756. So even though fighting started a little bit earlier in North America, the true range of dates, at least in legal terms, is from 1756 to 1763, or seven years."
Social Studies,"It's a complicated name for a complicated war, but really what it came down to was England and France duking it out over who was going to be the supreme imperial power in the world, and they were concerned about who was going to have the most territory in the world, therefore, their concern over who was going to control North America and their competing claims here, and also access to trade."
Social Studies,"So who was going to be able to trade with North Americans? Who was going to be able to trade with the lucrative Indian subcontinent, and who would be the leading power in Europe? So let's dial in a little closer on the North American theater of this war, which will have the most effect on the future United States. Alright, so here is map of territorial claims by European powers in North America before the Seven Years' War."
Social Studies,"Now you can see that there are some places where they overlap, which is really gonna be the heart of the problem in this conflict. So England, shown here in red, I'm gonna outline it a bit, was, as you know from your early American history, here along the eastern seaboard of what's today the United States, and also up into Canada. France claimed this interior region of Canada and today of the territorial United States, and Spain was in the mix here."
Social Studies,"Remember Spain has still been a fairly influential colonial power in Florida and in contemporary Mexico, and also down here in Cuba and South America. Alright, so we've got three major European powers in the mix here in North America, England, France, and Spain, but what this map doesn't show is the American Indian powers, who are also in this area."
Social Studies,"So most of this region really west of the Appalachian mountains, is Indian country, and the majority of inhabitants were Native Americans, and they really held the majority of power in this region as well. So major Native American groups that are in play in this conflict are Iroquois Confederacy, and also Cherokees, Hurons, Algonquians, Abenakis, and Mi'kmaqs, and that's just a small sampling."
Social Studies,"So you can see that there are a number of important Native American tribes who are specifically in this area of Canada, which is disputed, and also moving in the greater Appalachian region. So what does each of these groups want? Well, England definitely wants territory. They want to make sure that they're English settlers along the eastern seaboard, whom we'll soon be calling Americans, have room to expand."
Social Studies,"The French wanna make sure that they still have access to trade with Native Americans because their main concern is fur, which is a very valuable commodity in Europe, and Spain wants to make sure that they have access to their sugar islands and also their precious metals in the Caribbean and in South America."
Social Studies,"Now it's worth noting, 'cause I think this is really interesting to students of American history, that all of this territory, all of North America, was way less valuable than all of this territory because we're not talking about just value in land. We're talking about value in commodities, and what the Caribbean had was sugar, and sugar is the most valuable crop in this time period."
Social Studies,"So a tiny island down here in the Bahamas is probably worth more to a European power than the entire interior of North America, and what do these Native American groups want? Well, some of them want help with revenge on each other. Many other smaller Native American groups have been displaced by the Iroquois, who are here in upstate New York, kind of Quebec region."
Social Studies,"So the Iroquois is actually expanding and really defending their claim as the largest Native American empire, but the other thing that they want is to make sure that their territory is no longer encroached upon by English settlers in particular. Now one mistake I see early students of U.S."
Social Studies,"history making is thinking that all Native Americans kind of shared a cultural and political bond, right? That they saw themselves as one larger people who had to unite against the encroachment of Europeans, and that was definitely not the case. Native Americans had been living in this territory for thousands of years, and they had enemies and beef with other groups that went back way longer than the arrival of Europeans in North America."
Social Studies,"So when nations like England and France arrived with their weapons and their trade goods, the American Indians didn't look at each other and say, ""Oh wait, now we're all one race. ""We need to join together against ""the encroachment of whites."" They saw England and France and Spain as possible avenues to getting one up on their older enemies. So when an English trader sold a gun to, say, a Huron, he was way more likely to go after, say, the Iroquois with that gun than he was to go after a French trader."
Social Studies,"So another reason why the Seven Years' War is a better name for the French and Indian War than French and Indian War is because these Native American groups did not ally all with France. In fact, the Iroquois and Cherokee ended up allied with England, and most of the other Native American groups ended up allied with France, but they were fighting each other in addition to fighting England."
Social Studies,"Alright, so the stage is set for this conflict with all of these competing groups in this unclear territory, and how this turns into a war, we'll get to in the next video.."
Social Studies,"Would it be England? Or would it be France? Now in the North American theater of this war, England, France, their Native American allies on both sides were vying for territory and particularly territory along the Appalachian mountain range in upstate New York, Canada. This kind of western territory that was the border between the English settlement and Indian country to the west."
Social Studies,"In this video, let's talk about how the war actually progressed and what it's consequences were for North America and later, the United States. All right, so we've got the English, the French, and a number of Native American tribes all kind of jostling for position in North America. Now what stresses the British out the most the presence of the French in the Ohio River Valley. Both, the British and the French have laid claim to this territory."
Social Studies,"And they're both eager to strengthen their territorial claims, by building forts, and otherwise having a show of possession of the area. They argue over who had a presence there first. So to establish the English presence in the Ohio River Valley the English send a young officer named George Washington to build a fort. George Washington is only 22 years old at the time."
Social Studies,"And he and his men go out this area and they run into some French with their Native American allies at Fort Duquesne which is where the Alaganee, Monhongahela, and Ohio rivers come together. Which is today, Pittsburgh. So George Washington and his allies get the jump on the French. But, that doesn't last very long. They're overpowered and they fall back and establish Fort Necessity. On account of it was necessary."
Social Studies,"And they managed to hold out for a little while but eventually the French, the Canadians, and their Native America allies forced Washington to surrender. And he goes back to Virginia. So that's 1754. And we'll call that Fail number one. All right, so then a year later 1755, the British try to displace the French from Fort Duquesne once again. And they send Major General Edward Braddock George Washington, once again, now he's 23. Back to Fort Duquesne and it's a complete disaster."
Social Studies,"This time, the French and their Indian allies get the drop on the English, and with a much smaller force, completely desinate the English troops. And Braddock is killed. And George Washington has to take command of the retreat. So that's Fail number two."
Social Studies,"In general, this war does not go terribly well for the British at the beginning, except in one area, Acadia, where the British manage to attain control and they kick out the French settlers, the Acadians, who are transported down to the French settlement of New Orleans. In Louisiana. Where eventually, their name becomes garbled and they're known as the Cajuns. Not the Acadians, but the Cajuns. In 1756 England finally gets around to actually declaring war on France."
Social Studies,"But it's really not for another year that the war starts to actually go well in 1757. And the reason that the war starts going well for the English, finally, is that the Prime Minister, William Pitt, decides that he is going to pour money into this endeavor. So he thinks that the English have just not had enough men, materials, money, Indian allies, up until this point. So he is really going to commit the British empire exiling the French from this area of North America."
Social Studies,"So between 1757 and 1760, things really start looking up for the British. They finally capture Fort Duquesne. And they capture the Ohio Valley. Nova Scotia. Upstate New York. And, Quebec. So, by 1760 pretty much all the fighting is done in North America. The English have more or less forced the French out of the eastern seaboard and Canada. And in 1763, the English and the French sit down to hammer out the Treaty of Paris."
Social Studies,"So the Treaty of Paris, in 1763, and I apologize, I cannot help the fact that there are like a million treaties of Paris. There's also the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War. There's the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish American War. Paris was the place where you made treaties and they're all called the Treaty of Paris. But this is the one that happened in 1763. In general, this was a big victory. For the English. The English not only got most of France's possessions in the New World."
Social Studies,"They got New France, AKA Canada. They got Spanish Florida. Spain was fighting on the side of France. So they lose that. They got a bunch of Sugar Islands. In the Caribbean. And they pretty much got recognized as the premiere power in Europe. And the premiere imperial power. So, the largest and most powerful empire in the world. And let's not forget that the colonial Americans citizens of Massachusetts, and New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, they were on the winning side here."
Social Studies,"They fought alongside the British regulars. They repelled the French and their Native American allies. This was actually a pretty big confidence boost young America. But there were some other consequences of this war. On the not so good side, the Seven Year's War was not particularly good for Native Americans, in general. Both those who had allied with the British. And those who had allied with the French."
Social Studies,"They no longer had two imperial powers vying against each other in North America that they could play off of each other. Now, Native Americans were only dealing with the British. Who certainly were not giving them a fair seat at the table. Not long after the Seven Year's War, they will institute what's called the Proclamation of 1763. Which was basically a boundary line along the Appalachian mountains saying that that was going to be the end of white settlement."
Social Studies,"That they would reserve all the lands west of the Appalachians for Native Americans. Well, you can imagine how much the American white settlers respected that. Which is to say, they completely ignored this boundary line. So, the Native Americans will continue to be pushed farther west. And to develop more of what we call a race consciousness. The idea that they were all in one big group together who had to combine forces to repel English settlement."
Social Studies,"The other major outcome of the Seven Year's War was taxation. Remember that William Pitt won the Seven Year's War by pouring money into it. At the end of the Seven Year's War England is in a lot of debt. And, they have just gone to a lot of trouble to protect their North American interests."
Social Studies,"Now, as they are looking for ways to make revenue to make up the deficit, the Seven Year's War has placed on them, they look at their North American colonists and say, ""You should pay your way."" the American colonists, who have been used to more than century of called salutary, or benign neglect, are shocked and outraged that the British empire is now clamping down on them. And the colonists reaction to those new taxes will propel the colonies into revolution.."
Social Studies,"The Declaration of Independence was really the point of no return for the young United States of America, making an appeal to the rest of the world, to say that their time as a colony of the United Kingdom had ended. The principle author of the Declaration of Independence was this man here, Thomas Jefferson. I tried to find a picture of him as a young man. In fact, at the time, he was about 10 years younger than you even see him here. He was 33."
Social Studies,"Where did young Thomas Jefferson get all of the ideas that he expressed in the Declaration of Independence, and what happened to those ideas, once he put them down on paper? In this video, I'd like to explore some of the origins and effects of the Declaration of Independence. We often think that the Revolutionary War started with the Declaration of Independence. We think of 1776 as being this opening moment of the Revolution. In fact, parts of the Revolutionary War had been going on for some time."
Social Studies,"It was in 1765, more than a decade earlier, that some of the first unrest over taxation, specifically the Stamp Act, had begun. In 1773, the famous Boston Tea Party, when a group of colonists dumped over 300 crates of tea into Boston Harbor had happened. In 1775, over a year before the Declaration of Independence, the first shots of the Revolutionary War had taken place outside Boston, at the towns of Lexington and Concord."
Social Studies,"By the time the delegates had met in Philadelphia, the Revolutionary War had been a shooting war for more than a year."
Social Studies,"Why was it that in July of 1776, the delegates finally made the Declaration of Independence? The primary reason that they did it at this time, was because they wanted help, and they were particularly eager to get the assistance of the nation of France, which had been a long time enemy of the United Kingdom, and the delegates really knew that the new United States of America would have no hope of winning a war against a massive imperial power like Great Britain, without the help of another world power, such as France."
Social Studies,"In a way, what Jefferson was doing in the Declaration of Independence, wasn't so much declaring, but rather explaining why the states were declaring themselves independent, with the hope that they could get the sympathy and the help of the international community. Let's read some of the Declaration of Independence. I know that this is a gigantic block of text here, but bear with me. We'll grow through it fairly quickly."
Social Studies,"""The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen"" ""United States of America."" You'll notice here that he specifically points out that there are 13 United States. This is important, because it gives you a sense that they aren't really thinking of the individual former colonies, now states, as one larger country, but rather as a collection of states, a confederation of allied states, instead of a single nation."
Social Studies,"""When in the course of human events it becomes necessary"" ""for one people to dissolve the political bands"" ""which have connected them with another"" ""and to assume among the powers of the Earth,"" ""the separate and equal"" ""station to which the laws of nature,"" ""and of nature's God entitle them."" ""A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires"" ""that they should declare the causes which impel them"" ""to the separation."" Here's this explanation part, saying, we feel it necessary to explain why we want to separate from Great Britain."
Social Studies,"""We hold these truths to be self-evident."" ""That all men are created equal,"" ""that they are endowed by their Creator"" ""with certain unalienable rights,"" ""that among these are life, liberty,"" ""and the pursuit of happiness."" ""That to secure these rights,"" ""governments are instituted among men,"" ""deriving their just powers from the"" ""consent of the governed."" ""That whenever any form of government becomes destructive"" ""of these ends,"" ""it is the right of the people to alter,"" ""or to abolish it,"" ""and to institute new government,"" ""laying its foundation on such principles and organizing"" ""its powers in such form,"" ""as to them shall seem most likely to effect"" ""their safety and happiness."" I think this might be the most important passage of the Declaration of Independence, and let me tell you why."
Social Studies,"In this paragraph, you can really see the influence of the Enlightenment on Jefferson's thought. The Enlightenment was a period in the 1600s and 1700s, when people began to explore scientific observation and reason. They became more interested in observing the world around them, and trying to make reasoned arguments from what they saw, as compared to accepting the religious explanations for how the world worked."
Social Studies,"During the Enlightenment, many philosophers began to rethink government as well, and of questioning whether the governmental system in Europe and other places was the right system. There was one philosopher, in particular, who really captured Jefferson's imagination, and his name was John Locke. John Lcoke was an English philosopher, who had lived in the 1600s, and he wrote a book that had really influenced Jefferson and many thinkers in this time period, called Two Treatises on Government."
Social Studies,"There are two really important points in Locke's work. One was the idea of natural rights. What Locke meant by natural rights, are rights that were endowed by nature, that all people were born with. If you think about Europe in this time period, there was a sense that some people were born with more rights than others. In fact, there was the idea of the Divine Right of Kings, that the king, or monarch of any sort, had been born the king because God wanted that person to rule. Locke rejects that."
Social Studies,"He says when people are born, they're all born the same, and they all have rights that can't be given away, that are unalienable, and those are life, liberty, and property. Sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it? The other important idea that Locke had, was the idea of the Social Contract."
Social Studies,"The idea of the Social Contract was that, government came from the people, that society members got together, and agreed on what the forms of government should be, so that the only just government, was one that took into account the opinions of the people who live within it. You see that here, too."
Social Studies,"""Governments are instituted among men,"" ""deriving their just powers from"" ""the consent of the governed."" There's a third thing that Locke suggests that Jefferson also gets at, which is that when governments become tyrannical, when they do not abide by the Social Contract, it is the right of the people to rebel. All right, back to the Declaration. Most of the rest of the Declaration is just a list of grievances of what the King has done to the colonies that has made them very angry."
Social Studies,"This is an extremely abridged list of them. I highly recommend you read the entire Declaration, 'cause I think it gives you a really good sense of what the colonists were thinking at this time period. Here are some of the highlights. Jefferson says that the ""King has kept among us, in times of peace,"" ""standing armies without the consent of our legislatures."" Those are the British regulars who have been stationed in North America for a long time."
Social Studies,"""For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world."" The Navigation Acts, that said the colonies could only trade with Great Britain. ""For imposing taxes on us, without our consent."" The idea of taxation without representation, which really motivated the colonists to rebel. And so forth and so on. Now, it's worth noting that the Declaration of Independence, as an explanation hoping to get France on the side of the new United States, worked very well."
Social Studies,"The United States allied with France, which led them to win the Revolutionary War in 1783. As we close, it's worth pondering, what it was that Thomas Jefferson really meant by the phrase, ""All men are created equal."" The Revolutionary War didn't abolish slavery in the United States. In fact, Jefferson himself owned over 100 enslaved people of African descent."
Social Studies,"When Jefferson said, ""All men are created equal,"" was he thinking only of all white men? Was he thinking only of elite white men? After all, after the Revolution, only a handful of propertied elite men could vote. But then, there's this larger idea here. He's saying that your ordinary man wasn't born any different than someone who was born a king, so why should someone who was born black be different than someone who was born white? It's hard to imagine how Jefferson separated those things in his mind."
Social Studies,"Certainly, others at the time period, realized that there was an inherent contradiction between slavery, and also between the rights of women, and the idea that all men are created equal. Over time, the rhetoric of the Declaration of Independence would go on to spur many different movements for independence and civil rights. The most notable of which being the French Revolution, which took much of its rhetoric from the American Revolution."
Social Studies,"Later, in 1848, the first women's rights movement would gather at Seneca Falls, New York, and release what they called the Declaration of Sentiments. Which began, ""All men and women are created equal."" So Jefferson's ideas here, are both deeply radical, insisting that ordinary people are just as good as kings, and even more, entitled to decide their own form of government. But that Revolution only went so far. It didn't change much about the status of every day citizens in the United States."
Social Studies,But it put forward an ideal which we've been working toward ever since..
Social Studies,"So could you take us through a little bit what the Articles of Confederation were and the context in which we first brought them on as a governmental system? - [Leah] Sure, so I think the most important thing to understand about the Articles of Confederation and why we would talk about this is because one of the biggest debates that we have in our history is about the balance of power between the federal government and state governments."
Social Studies,"When the Articles of Confederation were first created, it was in the middle of the American Revolution. They were created in 1777, and so the question becomes, well, how can we run a government that looks as different from monarchy as possible? - [Kim] Right, so they're trying to run away from the past that they're getting away from in the Revolutionary War and trying to create a separate government that doesn't have any of those abuses that they are rebelling against."
Social Studies,"- [Leah] If they're running away from a monarchy, what they're running towards is what we would call limited government. - [Kim] OK. - [Leah] So their central government, which is synonymous with a federal government, the central government is actually really, really, really small. - [Kim] OK. - [Leah] They don't have an executive branch. They only have Congress. They don't even have a judicial branch. So Congress is made up of all 13 states. Every state had one representative. - [Kim] OK."
Social Studies,"- [Leah] In order to change the Articles of Confederation, if they wanted to pass an amendment, they had to get unanimous consent from all 13 states. - [Kim] OK, so they're trying to make sure that all of the states are represented equally, but that also sounds like it would have a lot of hurdles to overcome when it comes to getting consensus. - [Leah] Yeah, for laws, you had to get nine out of 13 states to actually pass a law."
Social Studies,"So if you can imagine, if you're in a room of 13 people and you all have to agree on one pizza topping for the rest of your lives. (Kim laughs) It would be almost impossible, right? - [Kim] Wow, OK, alright, so it sounds like there are some problems with the Articles of Confederation, but did they do anything good for us in this early period? - [Leah] Yeah, so the biggest thing is that it unites all 13 colonies who are now states under one government. - [Kim] OK."
Social Studies,"- [Leah] This government is able to pass a really favorable treaty with Britain and end the Revolutionary War in 1783, the Treaty of Paris. - [Kim] OK, so this is kind of the government that gets us through the revolutionary war and is with us when we first start in the 1780s."
Social Studies,"- [Leah] Yeah, and one another specific law that they pass is the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and this Northwest Ordinance kinda tells us how we are going to expand as we move west and what are we going to do with that land, and that's a really important idea when we're moving forward with our country. The only problem is with the Articles of Confederation is there is a lot of things that we still have to figure out as we're growing, there's a lot of growing pains."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So what led the early government of the United States to realize that they wanted to abandon these Articles of Confederation in favor of a different constitution? - [Leah] So the inciting incident is Shays' Rebellion. It happens in Massachusets, and it's a group of farmers led by this guy named Daniel Shays. What's happening is that we had just gotten out of the Revolutionary War, and a lot of of the people who had fought in the Revolutionary War still hadn't gotten payment for their duty."
Social Studies,"They also were experiencing really high state taxes, so Daniel Shays and these farmers are very upset, obviously, in their wanting their money and so they started rebelling, but the problem is, with the way that the central government that was built, first, Congress had no ability to levy or collect taxes. If they couldn't collect taxes, they had no ability to actually pay back their farmers."
Social Studies,"Along with that, they didn't have any money to create a military, so each state had their own militia, but the United States as a whole as a country did not have a military to suppress this rebellion. So on both ends, we are in a really bad situation politically. - [Kim] Wow, so, there's this moment where you find armed rebellion against the United States for a lack of money and the US government finds that it can't raise money and it can't raise an army to put down this rebellion."
Social Studies,"- [Leah] Exactly, and so there is this fear immediately. And what we see is a lot of the founding fathers that we know and really respect today like George Washington and Ben Franklin and Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, they get together and they say this is a problem, we need to change what we have, and this leads to the Constitutional Convention in which we draft our second constitution."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Right, yeah, so in 1787, the leaders of the United States get together and say, alright, the Articles of Confederation aren't working. We're gonna need a stronger central government, even though we were trying to get away from the monarchy and now let's think of something that's going to work a little bit better for us.."
Social Studies,"What were the Articles of Confederation, and why did they need to get replaced? - Well, the Articles of Confederation were the first loose set of rules to govern these 13 states, but they were a mess. Essentially, they allowed the states to be kind of their own little sovereign islands. So, it was not a united nation. It was like an Archipelago of islands. And, the reason they were a mess. There's a couple of things."
Social Studies,"when they tried to repay the Revolutionary War soldiers, Congress and Washington with very little power, had to go to the states and say, please give us some money so we can repay the soldiers. A lot of the states said, no thank you. We're not going to do that."
Social Studies,"Then if you had a river that rolled through several different states, and you wanted to have a trade agreement with the Spanish, for example, to use that river and trade along it, then the government didn't have one way to negotiate with the Spanish. Individual states had to do it, and individual states had different interests. Some wanted to trade with the Spanish. Some didn't want to trade at all. And so, how do you get those states to agree on something? There was also not universal coinage."
Social Studies,"The states all made their own money and differently. Well, states might print a bunch of money in order to payoff some debts, and then the money in one state is worth less than the money in another, who regulates all of that? So, commerce, and industry, and self-defense. There was no way to raise an army an pay for it. So, the nation was crumbling before they got to Philadelphia in 1787."
Social Studies,"- And to your point, in most countries the parts of the country are called things like provinces, but ours are states, because they view themselves as individual countries. - Absolutely, and because of course, the Articles of Confederation had been formed in the wake of this fear, and the experience of the fear of a monarchy."
Social Studies,"So, they wanted personal liberty, and get the monarchy and national control, throw it all away, because they believe that once you consolidate control, in a national government of any kind, that it would trample liberty. And so, after having fought a revolution for the purposes of liberating the people, you're not gonna design a government that then stomps down on that liberty."
Social Studies,"So, they created something that gave the states lots of flexibility, and then that flexibility allowed everybody to go off in their different directions. - So, Articles of Confederation, maybe too much independence for the individual states. So, it seems like there was a consensus to fix it. What was the central debate when they decided to fix it? - Well, there was a consensus it had to be fixed, but when they got to Philadelphia."
Social Studies,"First of all, Rhode Island was invited and said no thank you, so 12 of the 13 states showed up. And, they knew they wanted to centralize things. But, what did that mean? And, did it mean one president, or a council of presidents? Did it mean a strong Congress? How strong? Could they tell states what to do? Well, if they did that then they were acting just like George III had acted."
Social Studies,"So, they had to iron out all of these issues to bring enough central control, and enough quick movement of government, that it could address national problems, but not so much that it trampled and stomped on that liberty. And, that was the constant debate. Constantly trying to figure out how to keep the balance between giving enough national power, but enough liberty. And that, some of the biggest fights included fights over slavery, North versus South, fights over big states versus small states."
Social Studies,"Who has representation in this national government, and how do you figure that out? And then of course, the question of do we want a president? Will it be a single person, and how the dickens do we elect that person? Which led us to the Electoral College, which has had some bumpy history. - And, where do you think we ended up? If on a scale of zero to 10. If was zero was a complete, you know, independent states, and 10 is a federal government that just controls everything."
Social Studies,"Where do you think the US Constitution ended up relative to the Articles of Confederation? - Well, in September of 1787, when it gets September 17th, 1787. When the new Constitution gets voted on, it is a stronger national document that has basically three main parts. One, the people are at the heart and center of it. It is the people who are the representatives, or at the center of the republican government. The second thing is that the national government can tell states what to do in some instances."
Social Studies,"Those instances are circumscribed, but it can happen. The states have to fall in line. That was very new, and there is this thing called a presidency which is created. Single person, created really in the mold of George Washington."
Social Studies,"So, it is a nationalized government, but with a strong attention to this question of protecting liberty through a balance of power system, so that both the national government has checks and balances, and also the relationship between the federal government and the state government has a number of checks and balances."
Social Studies,"So, even though they went in a more centralized direction, they were constantly attentive to this idea of liberty, keeping it free in the states, and not messing with them too much in their effort to get some kind of centralized control. - So, it sounds like they might have gone from a one or a two with the Articles of Confederation, to maybe a seven? - Well, they went, I think they went from a one or two to maybe a five or a six, which has now moved. - Over time."
Social Studies,"- Over time, closer to maybe an eight or nine. - Fascinating.."
Social Studies,"That was more than a decade after the Declaration of Independence. So there was this 11-year plus period before the United States had its modern day constitution and during that time, fought the Revolutionary War, won in 1783, and tried out a completely different system of government called the Articles of Confederation, which we talked a little bit more about in another video. Now the Articles of Confederation had a very strong sense of limited government."
Social Studies,"In fact, you could think of the Articles of Confederation as being a little bit more like a loose confederation of states, where each state had one vote in the legislative branch, the branch that makes laws, and they had to really agree on most things, nine out of 13 for most legislation and unanimous agreement for any kind of amendments to this system. And I think it's clear why the founders first went with this system of limited government because they had just revolted against a monarchy."
Social Studies,"They thought of the states as being in what they call just kind of a league of friendship, can almost see it as being similar to the European Union today, independent nations who do some things together for foreign policy reasons and economic reasons. Now by the late 1780s, it was becoming clear that the Articles of Confederation were not working. With such a weak central government, it was really hard to get things done. They couldn't raise taxes. They couldn't raise a military."
Social Studies,"Some states were even putting taxes on the goods of other states. So in 1787, delegates from 12 of the 13 states, Rhode Island did not participate because Rhode Island was not a big fan of central government, came together in Philadelphia, in the same place where they had signed the Declaration of Independence, to think about how to revise the Articles of Confederation. And some very notable figures were there. George Washington is one of them. See Ben Franklin over here, and James Madison."
Social Studies,"Although some people that you might have expected to be at the Constitutional Convention were not, namely, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams who were out of the country being diplomats at the time. So the delegates at the Constitutional Convention have a pretty difficult problem to solve."
Social Studies,"They want to have a stronger central government, one that can get things done, make sure the states play well together, raise armies, raise taxes, but they don't want a central government that is too strong because they just escaped from monarchy. They don't wanna recreate monarchy in the United States. So they're looking for a very delicate balance of a government strong enough to get things done but not so strong as to promote tyranny."
Social Studies,"Now even though the delegates were supposed to be revising the Articles of Confederation, some people had, in secret, been considering completely throwing out the Articles of Confederation and starting anew. But one of the biggest hurdles they had to solve was what would a new sort of legislature look like. So the Virginia delegates suggested a plan for the legislature, it's the law-making body, that would be bicameral, means two room or two house from bi, meaning two, and camera, Latin for room."
Social Studies,"And their idea was that there would be a lower house, similar to the House of Commons in English Parliament, that would be directly elected as individuals would vote for the representatives but the number of representatives that each state would get would be decided by their population. Now Virginia was the largest state by population by far and so, this plan would have worked out pretty well for them because they would have gotten the largest proportion of representatives."
Social Studies,"Small states like Delaware, and Georgia, Rhode Island, would have very few representatives indeed, comparatively. They also wanted to have an upper house, similar to the House of Lords in the British Parliament, which would be appointed by state legislatures. But just like the lower house, the number representatives would also be determined by population. Now as you can imagine, the small sates were not big fans of having representation based just on population, so they came back with a different plan."
Social Studies,"This was called the New Jersey Plan. So the little states said, ""All right, the Virginia Plan ""gives way too much power to the big states. ""We want an equal voice in legislation."" So the New Jersey Plan, much like the Articles of Confederation, gave one vote to each of the states so that the small states would have the same representation in Congress as the large states and their plan was for a single chamber or unicameral legislature."
Social Studies,"So this really wasn't much different from the Articles of Confederation at all. So how did the delegates resolve this issue of how to balance the voices of large states with large populations with small states that had small populations? Because in a situation where all states have an equal number of votes, like in the New Jersey Plan, the 60,000 residents of Delaware could have as much say as the almost 700,000 residents of Virginia. Meaning that the people who live in Delaware were in fact more powerful."
Social Studies,"But at the same time, you wouldn't want it so that people living in the larger states could get their way all the time. What if the people in Delaware had a very legitimate concern that those in Virginia didn't share? It would be impossible to get all of these states to agree, to amend, or replace the Articles of Confederation if some of them felt like their interests aren't being taken into account at all."
Social Studies,"So to solve this issue of how to weight the representation of the states, the delegates came up with what's called the Great Compromise or sometimes the Connecticut Compromise. And in a way, what they did was combine these two plans. They made a legislative branch that was bicameral, two house, with a lower and an upper house and this lower house become the House of Representatives, where each state would have representatives in proportion to their population."
Social Studies,"So states that have large populations have more representatives. States with small populations have fewer representatives. And those representatives would be directly elected by the people. Now, and this time, the people was a fairly small proportion to vote in 1790s. You had to be a white man with fairly significant property, so it wasn't full suffrage. It wasn't event full suffrage for white men, but these folks were elected by vote. And then this upper house would be the Senate."
Social Studies,"And in the Senate, each state would have two senators, regardless of their size, so that as legislation moved through Congress, first from the lower house, where it would be approved and if approved, sent to the upper house, there, all states would have an equal voice in whether legislation was passed. And in this upper house, the senators would not be directly elected but rather appointed by state legislatures. And in fact, senators were appointed into the 20th century."
Social Studies,Now the Great Compromise wasn't the only compromise made at the Constitutional Convention. They made a number more and we'll talk more about those and about the other two branches of the government in the next video..
Social Studies,"In fact, there are seven more articles of the constitution. So here, I'd like to spend some time taking a closer look at some of the other articles, paying special attention to the executive branch and the judicial branch, but before we do that, I just want to take a moment to marvel at the size of the constitution. Not because it's so big, but because it's so small."
Social Studies,"This is the first page of the constitution, famously starting with, ""We the people,"" but the entire original constitution could fit on four pages. Compare that to the constitutions of many other nations which are hundreds of pages long, and I think the idea here in having a constitution that's really only seven articles long was that it was gonna set down principles."
Social Studies,"This wasn't going to be a whole set of laws that outlined everything that a state should do in any situation but rather a set of broad ideas around which lawmaking decisions could happen. In a way, you could think of the constitution as being kind of broad enough to be flexible."
Social Studies,"They spoke in larger generalities that could be applied to many different situations, and I think the proof that this was a good way to think about putting together a constitution is just in the fact that we'd still have this constitution today, more than 200 years after it was written in 1787. The US Constitution is the oldest constitution in the world that is still in effect at the national level. I think that's a pretty big deal."
Social Studies,"How did this constitution work? Well, let's look a little bit more closely at these first three articles and the branches of government they created. One of the ways that the framers of the constitution attempted to remedy the problems caused by the single branch government under the Articles of Confederation was creating a three branch government. One branch, established in Article 1, would be the Congress and within this building is the House of Representatives and the Senate."
Social Studies,"And this would be in the eyes of the framers, really the most powerful of the branches. They gave Congress the power to make law, to tax, to raise an army, to coin money."
Social Studies,"They really envisioned that most of the day to day operations and most of the power of government would fall under the duties of Congress, but one thing that the Articles of Confederation had lacked was a powerful executive, so the second branch of government, established in Article 2 is the executive branch, the head of which is the president. The job of the executive would be to enforce or carry out the laws made by Congress, and that would include doing things like waging war."
Social Studies,"Remember that the first president was George Washington, who had been the General of the Revolutionary Armies, but the president could also kind of have the front lines on dealing with foreign nations, so negotiating treaties, and would also have the power of appointing many government officials. And lastly, the third branch would be the judicial branch of government, established in Article 3. The head of the judicial branch would be the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land."
Social Studies,"Of course, there are many other smaller courts below it at the state and district level. The Supreme Court's job, along with other courts, would be to interpret the law, to see whether or not things done by Congress and the president fell within the bounds of the constitution. And the framers really thought that the judicial branch would end up being the weakest branch of government, although both the presidency and the Supreme Court have grown in power over the years."
Social Studies,"Now, this is an incredibly brief overview of these three branches. These articles include lots more in them about the specific powers of each of these branches and the kinds of requirements one would need to become a representative or president, so I highly recommend that you read more about the Constitution and check out these articles."
Social Studies,"But what I want you to get out of this is that the framers here were trying to separate the powers of government, so they wanted to make sure that to avoid having too much power in government. Remember that they are trying to escape from the monarchy."
Social Studies,"They want to make sure that government power is kind of diffused among these three branches with the idea that they're going to have to argue with each other to get things done, they're going to have to cooperate with each other to get things done, so the separation of powers is one of the key principles of the Constitution. Another key principle is checks and balances."
Social Studies,"What do I mean by checks and balances? Well, this is the idea that each of the branches of government has the power to check in the sense of stop, like checkmate in chess, the other branches of government. I think of this as kind of like a giant governmental game of rock, paper, scissors. Now, there are many ways that these branches can check each other, but I just wanna give a couple of quick examples to help you understand what that might be like."
Social Studies,"Alright, say that Congress makes a law, and the president doesn't like that law. The president can use the power of the veto to kill that law, and if Congress gets annoyed enough with the president, they might use their power to impeach the president. What about the judicial branch? The judicial branch's main checking function is declaring laws unconstitutional. The president or Congress may put through a law that the Supreme Court says is not consistent with the Constitution."
Social Studies,"The judicial branch can then kill that law by declaring it unconstitutional. What happens if the other branches are unhappy with the judicial branch? One way that the president can check the judicial branch is through appointing judges. This would kind of change the composition of the court, the people on the court, and so over time, the presidency can influence who is on the Supreme Court and how they rule on laws."
Social Studies,"And lastly, if Congress isn't happy with the Supreme Court, they might be able to impeach justices, or change jurisdiction of the lower courts. In this way, like the separation of powers, the framers intended to make sure that one branch couldn't get too powerful, because it would be able to check the other branches. You could really think of this as being a brilliant way of harnessing peoples' natural inclination to look out for themselves."
Social Studies,"As rivalries developed, as people tried to do what they thought was best, they could help keep government honest by fighting among themselves, and as they all strove and checked each other, it would keep all of government from becoming too powerful.."
Social Studies,"You see these ideas all over the literature of the time period, perhaps most famously in Thomas Jefferson's language in the Declaration that all men are created equal, endowed with certain unalienable rights, the idea that everyone has the natural right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. You would see it in the most famous slogan of the revolution, no taxation without representation, the idea that the people would have a say in the laws that affect them."
Social Studies,"The revolution even went so far as to criticize the idea of monarchy, which pamphleteer Thomas Paine called absurd. These ideas criticized long-standing social norms about who deserved to rule versus who deserved to be ruled. It's likely that most of the founders thought these ideas primarily applied to the political struggle between the colonies and Great Britain, but it wasn't just elite white men who considered these radical notions and thought about how to apply them to their own lives."
Social Studies,"These revolutionary ideals increased the awareness of inequalities in society more broadly and caused some people to call for changes in voting rights, in the institution of slavery, and the status of women. One major change that the revolutionary ideals caused was an expansion of political democracy in state governments. So after the revolution, all the states wrote new constitutions. And every one of them instituted a representative government through an elected legislature."
Social Studies,"And almost all of them also reduced the property requirements for voting and office-holding, which previously had limited the franchise to wealthier white men. After the revolution, a majority of white men had the right to vote. And voting rights would continue to expand until all white men had the right to vote by the 1830s. In fact, some state constitutions, like New Jersey's, didn't specify who could vote, so long as they met the new lower property requirements."
Social Studies,"So between the revolution and 1807 when they changed the law, property-owning women and free people of color could vote. Another social change that was brought on by these revolutionary ideals was the emergence of the abolition movement to end the practice of slavery. So almost all of the founders were slave owners, and they didn't seem to notice any contradiction between the idea that all men are created equal and keeping Africans in perpetual bondage."
Social Studies,"But that did not mean that others missed the connection. During the revolution itself, many enslaved people escaped, filed petitions for freedom, or they joined the military to gain freedom on the side of the Americans, but more frequently on the side of the British who offered freedom in exchange for serving in the army."
Social Studies,"After the revolution, northern states either abolished slavery, or they began a process of gradual emancipation, so saying that enslaved people who were children might remain in slavery until they were in their mid to late 20s and then would be free, and their children would be free, so that over the course of the late 1800s and early 1900s, in most northern states, slavery was either entirely eliminated or phased out to the point that there was a very small enslaved population."
Social Studies,"Southern states did not abolish slavery in response to the revolution, and this would continue to expand sectional tensions between the north and the south until the Civil War. The last change in social values that I wanna discuss relates to women's role in the war. Women played a pretty crucial role in supporting the independence movement, and they also drew on the rhetoric of revolutionary ideas to support their claims for an improvement in status."
Social Studies,"Abigail Adams, who was the wife of John Adams, wrote to him while he was in Philadelphia working on the draft of the Declaration of Independence with Thomas Jefferson and others. She wrote, in the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors."
Social Studies,"If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation. In general, the revolution didn't result in a huge change of status for white women and none at all for enslaved women, but one idea did emerge that would foment social change farther down the line, and that was the idea of republican motherhood."
Social Studies,"So republican motherhood was the notion that for this new democratic American nation to work, the country was going to need virtuous citizens. And who taught men how to be virtuous citizens? Their mothers. So thinkers of the time period, particularly a Philadelphia physician and singer of the Declaration of Independence named Benjamin Rush, argued that women should receive more robust education in order to better educate their sons."
Social Studies,"So instead of only learning household skills or etiquette, women should learn philosophy and mathematics. Now, while this concept was mainly in the service of improving the education and virtue of men, it did result in the expansion of women's education and the founding of new schools and colleges for girls. And many of the girls who attended those schools would go on to be major reformers and activists in the women's rights and abolitionist movements in the 19th century."
Social Studies,"I wanna finish by just briefly taking a look at John Adams' response to his wife's letter encouraging hin to remember the ladies, which is not nearly as famous as her letter, but I think still tells us a lot about the ideas of the time period. He said, as to your extraordinary Code of Laws, I cannot but laugh."
Social Studies,"We have been told that our struggle has loosened the bands of government everywhere, that children and apprentices were disobedient, that schools and colleges were grown turbulent, that Indians slighted their guardians and Negroes grew insolent to their masters, but your letter was the first intimation that another tribe more numerous and powerful than all the rest were grown discontented. And there at the end he's referring to women. You can tell that John kinda takes this as a joke."
Social Studies,"He can't imagine that the ideas that he and the other founders used so persuasively in the American Revolution would lead women and African-Americans and working class people like apprentices to apply those same notions to themselves. But perhaps the joke was on John Adams after all, because that is exactly what they did.."
Social Studies,"He thinks, frankly, that rewriting the rules of the country, it's not gonna work. But they finally convince him to come and they make him president of the convention. And they put him at the front of the room, and he says almost nothing during the entire four months. But what he does is at the front of the room he is a model, because, remember, he resigned his commission as commander of the Continental Army and gave up power."
Social Studies,"He didn't seize the power that he had as, he was basically the biggest celebrity in America, and he gave his commission back to the government, which was an act of sublimating his own personal self interest for the benefit of the republic. And that's the model they wanted for the Constitution."
Social Studies,"So he didn't say much, but they designed basically, as one writer said that what they were essentially doing was writing his future job description, because everybody in the room knew he would ultimately become the president, because there was nobody else in America like him. And what was important was not that he was a general, but that he had this virtue inside of him, which was that he would know how far to go and when to stop, and when to protect those liberties."
Social Studies,"And so he sat on a chair with a sun on the back of it, and at the end of the proceedings, Benjamin Franklin, who was the only other great, kind of, superstar in America who participated in the convention said that he looked at that sun on Washington's chair, and he wasn't sure whether it was a rising sun or a setting sun, but now after they finished their work, he had decided that the sun was rising, which was basically anointing and blessing everything that had happened there, and this new office of presidency that they had created, that George Washington was to go walk into, and that's why Washington's statue is in front of Independence Hall where the Constitutional Convention took place."
Social Studies,"But in the dialogue over four months, you almost never see his words. He was there as a symbol and participant, but not like James Madison, or James Wilson, or Gouverneur Morris who were in there in the nitty gritty of every little detail. - Do we know what Washington was thinking, did he want the job, did he have a view, or he just said, ""Hey, I'm just gonna do what everyone else decides""? - Fortunately, they did everything in secret."
Social Studies,"Washington was so virtuous that he didn't even write about it in his diary. Now, fortunately, we have other people who did keep diaries, and James Madison took notes and said, ""Publish them only after all 55 members are dead."" What Washington thought is he wanted a central government, because as a general he knew there had to be an army to handle rebellions, and there had been Shays' Rebellion that had tested under the Articles of Confederation."
Social Studies,"So he wanted a strong government, but he was, and he was very worried that having been successful revolutionaries, they could do what he knew was hard by history, which is that revolutionaries aren't very good at creating governments. And so he knew that what they were doing was a real risk and a real gamble. He believed that it could be done, however. He believed that a strong national government was required."
Social Studies,"But then was he was given the job, he was incredibly nervous, this incredible military leader basically thought that he might fail. It was more likely than not that this whole darn thing would fail and that he might fail. And as he rode to his inauguration, he kept writing letters and in his diary talking about how the expectations of his countrymen were just too much for him. And that was both a personal worry, and he also worried about monarchy."
Social Studies,"How does monarchy build? It's either when a monarch demands power or when the mob hands all of the power to the person and says, ""Do everything for us,"" and gives them ultimate power. And what they knew in the convention was that human beings were sinful and could not handle power. If they were given the power, they would abuse it as surely as the sun comes up in the morning. And he was worried that if given too much power, perhaps he could be susceptible to that."
Social Studies,"And so he was for as confident and as much of a model of strength that he was, he was a very nervous guy. - And it sounds like an unusual person where the power, at least as the history I've read, didn't corrupt him and he didn't try to do a power grab. - That's right, Washington was constantly, he was a man of a rigid code, and he believed that the standards were necessary for the proper kind of human behavior."
Social Studies,"He wrote a list of a hundred different things that a gentleman should do to comport himself in the proper way in society, and that's what made him such a good model. - I'd like a copy of that. - (laughs) Yes, exactly. - I have a feeling I don't check most of them off. (laughing) - We'd all be better. But things like clearing your throat, how you behave in the presence of a lady. And he believed in these codes, because he believed if everybody maintained them, then the system would work."
Social Studies,"This was during the period where Newton's laws were making people think about a clockwork universe where if everything runs, if the machine is put together with tension, right, so it recognized that people were not angels, tension in the machine, but if everybody did their thing and the pieces stayed in their lane, as it were, then the clock would work."
Social Studies,"And so he had that code which tried to keep him in his place and keep everybody else in his place, and he set a standard, and then everybody tried to live up to it, as opposed to saying, ""Well, that standard's nice, ""but I'm now gonna go do this."" And that's why when he resigned his military commission, and he also undid a coup that some of his men were planning back when he was leader of the army."
Social Studies,"They were basically gonna go to Congress and say, this is in Newburgh, New York, they were gonna go to Congress and say, ""Unless you give us our money, ""we're gonna stage a coup."" He found out about the plot, went to his men and said, ""This is a sin both against the revolution ""and my own personal virtue, ""because I put myself on the line."" They backed off. And what he coulda done is say, ""Let's go, let's ride to Washington and get you your money. ""You fought in this war."
Social Studies,"""Your wives and children are begging and poor. ""You deserve this money. ""Let's use our power and authority and take it,"" and he said, ""No."" Joseph Ellis, the historian, writes about it as being the last temptation of Washington as a general. He has the chance to grab the power, and he says, ""No, we shouldn't do it."" And that's why he was a model, because he could resist the pull of power, and that's the image in which they wanted to create this new government. - Wow.."
Social Studies,"Now on the left side here, we have the data from the Northern part of the country. Now in purple you can see the percentage of the population of each colony that was enslaved in 1754, and generally, it wasn't a very large amount, think New York here had the most at about 14%. By 1800, however, you can see that the percent went down considerably."
Social Studies,"Some, like Massachusetts, outlawed slavery altogether, so they're at 0%, and others like New York or Rhode Island, began a process of gradual emancipation, phasing out slavery. Another thing to note is that new territories in the West that were claimed by the United States either had very small amounts of slavery, like in the Indiana Territory, or none at all, like in the Northwest Territory, where slavery was outlawed. Now let's compare that to the same period in Southern Regions."
Social Studies,"In most of the South in 1754, enslaved people made up a very significant portion of the population. In some cases, like in South Carolina, outnumbering whites at a rate of more than 60% of the population. And unlike in the North, as you see here in teal, in 1800, enslaved people remained a really quite large percentage of the population. In some cases, the percent of people who were enslaved grew considerably, like in Delaware or in Georgia, and in other places stayed about the same."
Social Studies,"In places like Virginia and South Carolina, the percent of the population that was enslaved actually dropped over this time period, but not because there were fewer slaves, but rather because the white population had grown faster than the enslaved population in the same time period. And unlike in the Northern Territories, the percentage of enslaved people in the new Southern Territories claimed by the United States, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, was quite significant as well."
Social Studies,"So what's happening here? Why, over this 50 year period, did slavery begin to die out in the North, while surviving, and even expanding West, in the South? How much change was there over this time period in the regional attitudes about slavery? And how would we even go about figuring that out? One way that we can attempt to measure the extent of change is by identifying the things that stayed the same during this time period, which we call Continuities, or aspects of society that continued on being the same as they were before, and Changes, aspects of society that were different than before."
Social Studies,"There are many different aspects of society that historians can trace changes and continuities in over time, like changes in politics or art or gender roles, but for this video, I'm gonna choose Economics and Ideas. Why am I choosing those two? Well, first and foremost, because slavery was an economic practice. It was a source of labor that supported the production of agricultural products."
Social Studies,"Second, I know that in this time period, the American Revolution introduced radical changes in ideas about Liberty and Equality, which stand in stark contrast to the institution of slavery. So let's compare the Economic systems and Ideas about slavery in each of these Regions, in 1754 and 1800, to see what changed and what stayed the same. So first, let's look at the Economic systems."
Social Studies,"In the North, where the climate and the soil was not suited for large scale plantation agriculture, the economy centered around family farms in 1754. Proximity to the coast facilitated fishing and shipping, and the people who actually did this work tended to be either the owners of the farms or the boats, or indentured servants, and a small number of enslaved laborers who worked for them. None of these activities really required the labor of a large number of enslaved people."
Social Studies,"All right, well, what about in 1800? Farming and fishing and shipping were still going strong, but as the first Industrial Revolution began to take off in the late 1700s, factories began to spring up in the North, and the cheapest labor source for these factories was immigrant laborers, not slaves, not indentured servants. Now let's look at the Economic systems of the South in 1754 and 1800."
Social Studies,"In 1754, plantation agriculture based on enslaved labor was the central economic system, and it was also the central economic system in 1800."
Social Studies,"But unlike in the North, where the technological innovations of the Industrial Revolution made indentured servants or enslaved laborers unnecessary, the major technological innovation of the cotton gin made cotton easier to process, and therefore, saved it as a profitable crop, which made slave owners eager to expand the institution of slavery, rather than phase it out. Next, let's take a look at the ideas about slavery, which were commonly held in each of the regions."
Social Studies,"In 1754 in the North, I would say a few people questioned the existence of slavery. Northern Shipping was involved in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The idea that masters deserve to rule slaves was as natural as the idea that kings deserve to rule their subjects. Even free people of color were rarely considered full British citizens, the way people of English descent were. How did things change in 1800? The Revolutionary War had a strong effect on the ideas about slavery in the North."
Social Studies,"Northerners apply the Revolutionary ideals of Liberty and Equality to long-standing ideas about social rules, and they found that slavery was incompatible with them. So after the Revolution, Northern States either abolished slavery or began to phase it out with gradual emancipation. But I wanna caution you into thinking that this turned the North into a racial utopia."
Social Studies,"People of African descent were still not permitted to become American citizens, even though the immigrants, who were beginning to flood in from Europe were. So I think it would be fair to say overall, that the North had never really needed slavery, and therefore, when the Revolution led many to question the institution of slavery, it was pretty easy to abolish it."
Social Studies,"How does that compare to the South's transition in this time period? Well, by 1754, the notion that slavery was natural and enslaved Africans were property was pretty well-ingrained. But the ideas of the Revolution didn't have quite the same effect on the South as they did in the North. If anything, by 1800, white Southerners were determined to enact harsher slave codes than ever because they feared uprisings, since the ideals of the American Revolution had inspired the Haitians to overthrow the French."
Social Studies,"So why did these changes in continuities over time matter? Well, because by 1800, you start to see attitudes around slavery crystallizing in the United States, creating a North where slavery was rare and considered a perversion of the ideals of the Revolution, and a South where slavery was central and considered natural and perhaps even a desirable way to organize society."
Social Studies,"And as white settlers from each of these regions moved farther and farther West, into territories that were opened up by the American victory in the Revolutionary War and by Indian removal, both Northerners and Southerners would export their Economic systems and their ideas about slavery into these adjacent Western lands. By 1820, this gradual process would erupt into Sectional crisis over slavery.."
Social Studies,"He fell asleep, and when we woke up the next morning, he went back into town and found that everything had changed. Instead of a sleepy village, there was a bustling town, and the inhabitants all seemed to be loudly debating over an election. One person wanted to know if Rip favored the Federalists or the Republicans, groups that he had never heard of."
Social Studies,"The King George Tavern had transformed into something called the General Washington Tavern, and outside it, someone had put up an unfamiliar flag bearing stars and stripes. Gradually, Rip realized that he had been asleep not just for one night, but for 20 years, and that he had slept through the entire American Revolution. Now, this is just a story, and it's a pretty fun one, I can't do it justice here, but I highly recommend you read it."
Social Studies,But this story reveals a lot about how Americans thought about the amount of social change that accompanied the American Revolution.
Social Studies,"If you, like Rip Van Winkle, fell asleep in the British colonies and woke up in the United States, which aspects of life would be familiar to you and which would be completely alien? In other words, how much did the American Revolution really affect society? If we set out to answer this question as historians, what we're really doing is exercising the historical thinking skill of continuity and change."
Social Studies,"What changed and what stayed the same from before the Revolution to after it? We know that the Revolution changed the political status of the British colonies in North America, which went from being part of the British Empire to being an independent nation, but how big of a deal was that, really? Was it not much more than erasing British colonies from the map and writing in United States instead, or did I actually lead to far-reaching changes in how people lived? If we're trying to answer this question, we really only have three options."
Social Studies,"First, things changed a lot. There was a great deal of change, and things were very different after the Revolution compared to beforehand. Second, things didn't change much at all. The Revolution was a revolution in name only, and most things were the same afterwards. Or third, some things changed but other things stayed the same. When we're asking what changed and what stayed the same over time, we need to be consistent about the aspects of society that we choose so that we're comparing apples to apples."
Social Studies,"So, let's decide which aspects we're going to compare over time. There are a lot that we could choose from, religion, slavery, gender roles, class and social structures, political institutions. It's a little like a choose your own adventure book for historians. All right, I'm gonna choose political institutions, social structures, and gender roles."
Social Studies,"Why am I choosing these? Well, I guess that I'm interested in how the ideas of the Revolution, that all men are created equal and that government should represent the will of the people, played out in reality. Did the Revolution really lead to more equality for men or for women? Did government really become more democratic? So, let's pretend that we're Rip Van Winkle, taking a gander at the society around us before and after the Revolution."
Social Studies,"I'm not gonna go into a whole lot of detail here, but if there's anything you're not familiar with, just jot it down and then you can look it up when you have a chance. So, what were political institutions, social structures, and gender roles like before the Revolution? Well, first of all, there were 13 separate colonies, not just one single nation. The colonies were ruled by a hereditary monarch, the King of England, and they had virtual representation in Parliament."
Social Studies,"Colonists considered themselves Englishmen who were entitled to the rights of Englishmen. Colonies had property requirements and usually also religious requirements for voters. Economically, things weren't too bad for your average white colonist in the North, although by the eve of the Revolution, there was a growing number of poor people as land become scarcer. American colonists were generally better off than the working class back in Britain."
Social Studies,"In the South, however, the planter aristocracy ruled, with a handful of wealthy white slave owners dominating society and politics. White indentured servants still existed in both the North and the South, although the practice was becoming a little less common. Most African Americans, excepting a few free people of color in the North, were enslaved and had no hope of social mobility, save for running away."
Social Studies,"Indigenous people were taking advantage of the dueling empires of Britain and France as best they could, but after the Seven Years' War, the departure of France meant that they were dealing with Britain alone. The British government tired to prevent more conflict between white settlers and indigenous people with the Proclamation of 1763, which stipulated that the colonists could not expand west past the Appalachian Mountains."
Social Studies,"Gender roles in the American colonies mimicked those of British society pretty closely. White men did farm labor. Women cared for the home and children. A woman had no political or legal identity apart from her husband in a practice called coverture, so a married woman couldn't own property or vote. Both enslaved men and enslaved women worked in the fields. (yawns) All this history has tired me out. Let's take a little rest and come back to our chart in a minute."
Social Studies,"(crickets chirping) Ah, that was a nice nap. Hang on, what year is it? Did we sleep through the whole American Revolution? Yikes, let's finish this chart quickly. How different were political institutions, social structures, and gender roles after the Revolution? In terms of politics, things had changed. Instead of 13 separate colonies ruled by a king and Parliament, there was one nation ruled by a three-branch government, where citizens were directly represented in Congress."
Social Studies,"Instead of the rights of Englishmen, people appealed to Enlightenment ideas of natural rights, with protections from government tyranny enshrined in a Bill of Rights. Many states reduced or eliminated property and religious requirements for voting, expanding the electorate among white men."
Social Studies,"Overall, social structures were pretty similar, with the exception that the institution of slavery was being phased out in northern states, and the indentured servitude of whites was being phased out pretty much everywhere. In the South, slavery continued. For indigenous people, American independence meant that that Proclamation line was no longer being enforced and white settlers saw western lands as one of the prizes of victory in the Revolution. Gender roles also looked pretty similar to before the war."
Social Studies,"Coverture remained, and men and women continued working at the same tasks that they had prior to independence. One minor difference was the elevation in the status of white women, who earned respect for their contributions to the war effort as Daughters of Liberty. After the Revolution, they took up roles as Republican mothers who instilled civic virtue in their sons and also required more education in order to properly inculcate those values."
Social Studies,"So, what do we make of these changes in continuities? The biggest area of change was going from hereditary monarchy to democracy, expanding the vote for white men. The ideas of liberty and equality had some impact on social structures and gender roles, leading to the gradual abolition of slavery in the North and some new opportunities for women. If I were to answer our question with one of those three options, I'd say some things changed and some things stayed the same."
Social Studies,"The Revolution changed the rhetoric of rights and expanded democracy for white men but didn't have much of a positive impact on the lives of women, enslaved people, or indigenous people. Now, you could choose totally different aspects of society to look at and come up with a completely different take than me. This is what being a historian is all about. If we take care to select aspects of society to compare across time, we can answer some tough questions about how society changed. Sleep tight.."
Social Studies,"He said, ""The American continents, ""by the free and independent condition ""which they have assumed and maintained, ""are henceforth not to be considered as subjects ""for future colonization by any European powers. ""In the wars of the European powers ""in matters relating to themselves ""we have never taken any part, ""nor does it comport with our policy to do so."
Social Studies,"""We owe it, therefore, to candor ""and to the amicable relations existing ""between the United States and those powers to declare ""that we should consider any attempt on their part ""to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere ""as dangerous to our peace and safety."" So, basically, in one fell swoop, James Monroe told the crowned heads of Europe to stay out of the Americas. He said, ""As far as I'm concerned, ""the era of colonization is over."" Stop giving us the side-eye."
Social Studies,"Stop looking at your maps and trying to decide where you might place a little colony next. No more European colonization in the Americas. What's more, don't interfere. The Americas are the United States' concern so we don't want the powers of Europe to meddle in any of the affairs of Latin America or South America. You can keep your system, and by system, Monroe meant monarchy, out of the Americas. This is the hemisphere of democracy. So, this is an incredibly bold statement."
Social Studies,"Let's not forget here that the United States is not exactly a world power in 1823. They could, at best, be said to be a minor power, even in the Americas. The United States is not a major world military power, it's not a major world Navy power. Let's remember that in this era, having a strong Navy was tantamount to being able to take over the world. They're kind of a second-rate nation in a second-rate part of the world."
Social Studies,"So, what was the response when the United States made this incredibly bold assertion that they would not permit any more colonization or interference in the Americas from Europe? Mmm... Crickets. Nobody really cared. To the established powers of Europe, the United States was no more than a little mosquito, buzzing around, maybe making a lot of noise, a bit annoying, but pretty easy to swat."
Social Studies,"No matter how much noise the United States made, the only thing that mattered to the great powers of the world was whether or not the United States could enforce the Monroe Doctrine, which with such a weak military presence, they certainly could not. Nevertheless, the Monroe Doctrine became a key facet of American foreign policy throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century."
Social Studies,"It became a justification for Manifest Destiny and would play a major role in the foreign policies of Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. So, where did the Monroe Doctrine come from? Well, let's take a minute to look at some of the major world events of the time period and the major players who brought the Monroe Doctrine about. All right, dateline 1820. It has been a bad couple of years for monarchy in Europe."
Social Studies,"For one thing, the Napoleonic Wars and the French Revolution have been convulsing the powers of Europe for several years. By 1815, the Revolution has more or less finished and the monarchies of Europe have been reinstated. But, this revolutionary fervor coming from the French Revolution, coming also from the American Revolution, has started to spread. So, movements for independence are now taking hold in South America."
Social Studies,"There's a Chilean movement for independence, Argentinian movement for independence, Venezuelan movement for independence. So, they've kind of caught the democracy bug. The people in the United States are cheering for their southern brethren, saying, ""Excellent work, picking up democracy, ""breaking away from old-fashioned, monarchical, ""tyrannical Europe."
Social Studies,"""We're totally on your side."" But it's easier to make an independence movement happen when the home country is distracted with another war, aka the Napoleonic Wars."
Social Studies,"Once the Napoleonic Wars are over, the monarchies of Europe start saying, ""Hmm, you know what? ""Since Spain is in control of these nations, ""now Spain has the time and energy ""to consider maybe putting down these revolutions."" So, they're no longer distracted by war, and they have the manpower and the bandwidth to think about maybe trying to reinstate, or secure, Spanish rule in South America where nations have been in the process of revolution."
Social Studies,"Now, we don't know the extent to which Spain was actually planning on putting these revolutions down, but we do know that the United States and England were very concerned that the monarchies of the continent-- France and Spain-- might join together and try to put down all of these revolutions. Now, wouldn't they want that? Well, for the most part, it kind of came down to markets. If you think back to early American colonial society, the economic system was known as mercantilism."
Social Studies,"Mercantilism is the practice of colonies kind of existing to enrich the mother country. So, all trade goes through the home country. That means that the home country is going to be making sure that the colonies are not trading with any other international partners because they want to be the ones who are enriched by the natural resources of the colonies. So, when Chile and Argentina and Venezuela revolt from Spain, it means that their markets are now opened up to the United States and to England."
Social Studies,"So, England and the United States are not eager to see these new nations be returned to their colonial status because, thanks to mercantilism, they're not going to be able to trade with them anymore."
Social Studies,"With this idea in mind, the British Foreign Secretary, a man named George Canning, approached the American Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, and he said, ""Why don't we make a joint proclamation ""between the United States and Great Britain ""saying that the powers of Europe ""should not interfere in the New World.? And John Quincy Adams thought, ""Hmm, I'm not sure if I like you British folks."" Remember that the War of 1812 had not taken place too long beforehand."
Social Studies,"The United States was not quite ready to be friends with the United Kingdom yet. And they were a little bit afraid that if the United States made a joint declaration with England that it would seem a little bit like a flea on the back of a rottweiler saying, ""Don't mess with us or we'll bite you!"" The United States didn't have nearly the strength to actually make an equal partnership so it might have looked a little bit like they were hiding behind the British in a joint declaration, but J.Q.A."
Social Studies,"thought this actually still sounded like a pretty good plan so he floated the idea to President James Monroe. Now, there's kind of a movement of nationalism going on at this time in the United States. Even though the United States didn't technically win the War of 1812, they kind of felt like they had. So, they're busy kind of creating a new nationalist rhetoric in the United States. They're feeling pretty good about themselves. They stood up to their old foe of Great Britain, and won."
Social Studies,"Or, at the very least, didn't lose, but to them it was kind of the same thing. So, John Quincy Adams crafts for James Monroe what will become known as the Monroe Doctrine. Now, Monroe is not only concerned about the possibility of European powers coming down here and trying to start fights with each other over the fate of South America. Monroe was also worried about Russia, who had recently made some territorial claims in Canada, saying that their territory should come all the way down there."
Social Studies,"The Russians have started putting some forts on the coast of California, close to modern day San Francisco. So, Monroe sees the old monarchical powers of Europe sort of encroaching both from the north and the south here. And so, in 1823, he makes the announcement of the Monroe Doctrine. He says, ""No more colonization. ""Russia, get out of there. ""And no more interference, in general. ""So, don't try to turn these new republics ""back into colonies under the rule of monarchies."
Social Studies,"""In fact, just keep your monarchy ""out of our hemisphere altogether."" Monroe makes this statement completely outside of the relationship with the United Kingdom so it doesn't have this kind of riding on the coattails feeling of being allied with Britain. But nevertheless, the only way that the United States can actually count on the Monroe Doctrine being enforced is because the British Navy is so incredibly powerful. I'm going to draw a very bad boat here."
Social Studies,"Nobody who heard about the Monroe Doctrine thought, ""Ah, man, we better not make the United States angry."" What they thought was, ""Ah, man, we better not make the British Empire angry."" Because they knew that the British Navy, which wanted neutrality of the seas, which wanted to be able to continue to have these trade relationships with new nations in South America, would defend the neutrality and the independence of South America by proxy, and by doing so, kind of enforce the Monroe Doctrine."
Social Studies,"So, this is interesting. You could think of this as being a little bit weaselly on the part of Monroe, declaring that the Americas should remain free of the influence of Europe, but counting on the United Kingdom to enforce it. Or you could think of it as perhaps a brilliant policy maneuver. I don't know."
Social Studies,"Certainly, the nations of South America and Latin America appreciated this declaration of independence for the Americas coming from the United States, but they certainly knew that it was more about the United States making sure that they, themselves, were protected than wanting to have a real equal partnership with South America. So, the Monroe Doctrine really didn't amount to much for most of the 19th century."
Social Studies,"It was certainly a justification as the United States continued to push west in their quest of Manifest Destiny, but it will become increasingly important in the 20th century as the United States steps onto the world stage with things like the Spanish American War, under the auspices of William McKinley, and making famous Theodore Roosevelt, saying that the Caribbean is the province of the United States, and the nations of Latin America and South America."
Social Studies,"They're only to be dealt with through the United States. So, you can see the Monroe Doctrine as a very early expression of the United States' intention to become a world power and to be the leading and most powerful nation in the Americas. And you can also see it as an expression of American isolationism, which will really be the leading aspect of American foreign policy up until the Spanish American War."
Social Studies,"As early as George Washington's Farewell Address, Washington expressed the view that the United States should just not get involved in the business of Europe. That that would only lead to heartbreak."
Social Studies,"While the Monroe Doctrine is now kind of taking not only that idea that the United States should not become involved in the affairs of Europe, but also turning it around and saying that Europe should not become involved in the affairs of the Americas, drawing an even stronger barrier between the old world and the new.."
Social Studies,"So this is kind of a large period of history, and I don't think it's really important for you to have a laundry list of dates of exactly when what thing was invented, but just kind of take in the idea that in the first half or so of the early 19th Century there were many new inventions in both factory work and in transportation and communication, and that how people did business changed a lot."
Social Studies,"So I wanna take some time to look into all three of these revolutions: The Industrial Revolution, The Revolution in Transportation and Communication, and just the broader Market Revolution. So I know this is a subset of itself, but I'll get to that. And in this video I wanna start out by talking about The Industrial Revolution. OK, so what was The Industrial Revolution? This was, broadly speaking, a revolution in the kinds of machinery that people used to make finished goods."
Social Studies,"Now, if you think about the early republic in the United States you often think of kind of an agrarian society; and that was how Thomas Jefferson, the author of The Declaration of Independence, really imagined the United States, as a nation of small farmers. But Thomas Jefferson didn't necessarily see all of these revolutions in industry coming."
Social Studies,"He couldn't anticipate that; and so, in the 1790s, early 1800s, a bunch of new inventions came to the United States that completely revolutionized how things were made. So in this time period the United States kinda slowly begins its transformation from being a nation of farmers to a nation of people who worked for wages, by the hour, and then used the money that they made from that hourly labor to buy the things that they need."
Social Studies,"So how did this happen? One event that historians often point to is the introduction of the textile mill to the United States. So this fellow here, his name is Samuel Slater, and Samuel Slater was an Englishman who worked in a textile mill. And remember that the United Kingdom was the world's capital of textile production in this time. And they were so jealous of their position as the world's leading textile producer that they even made it illegal to export the plans for a textile mill."
Social Studies,"Samuel Slater decided that even if it was illegal to export actual plans, it wasn't necessarily illegal to export his brain, so he decided to memorize how these textile looms worked; and this is powered by a water wheel. And then he actually got in disguise, put himself on a ship, and came to Rhode Island to set up a textile mill. In fact, people were so angry that he did this that in his home town he's actually known as Slater the Traitor."
Social Studies,"So what was new about this? Well, I think the water-wheel aspect is really one of the key innovations here. So instead of being powered by humans or perhaps being powered by animals, now American machinery can be powered by an outside source: so water or steam; and that means that these mills and factories later are going to kinda congregate around sources of power, like rivers for example."
Social Studies,"So if you've ever wondered why so many American cities are next to rivers, it's usually because they needed them to power mills. So starting in the 1790s, and really into the early 19th Century, there's this slow transformation toward factory labor. And you can see in this image here that a lot of the people actually laboring in these factories were women because young men kind of had a pretty good path forward in life at this time period."
Social Studies,"They could be farmers, like their fathers; maybe they could learn a trade. But for young women there wasn't necessarily a form of income outside the house, and so a man named Charles Lowell decided to set up a whole series of textile mills in what will be called Lowell, Massachusetts. It's just outside of Boston. And then he primarily employed young women to work in these textile mills."
Social Studies,"Think partly because young women were associated with working with fabric; women frequently did the spinning and the sewing in the household; but also because women you could probably pay a little bit less than young men for the same kind of labor. So this is kind of a very slow revolution toward individual work. Because as a nation of farmers, most people would have worked in a family unit. And even some of the very earliest factories in the United States would hire family units."
Social Studies,"It was known as the Rhode Island System. By this time, by Lowell's mills, he started hiring individual workers for individual wages. And the working conditions were pretty brutal. Most women at the Lowell mills worked 12-hour days with no air conditioning, remember, this is long before there's air conditioning, for pretty low wages. I'd say probably about three dollars a week."
Social Studies,"But despite the pretty harsh conditions, for many of them this was a really good opportunity 'cause this was the first time in their lives they'd ever had any chance to make money of their own, to be away from their families. It's kind of expected that if you were a young woman in Massachusetts you wanted to go work in the Lowell mills. You could go there for a few years of your life, make a little bit of money, and then go back to your hometown, meet someone, get married, start a family of your own."
Social Studies,"So if kinda makes work for women outside the home respectable. And textile production is going to continue to ramp up in the United States. In the late 1840s a man named Elias Howe invents a really excellent sewing machine. He's not the first man ever to invent a sewing machine. There were versions of them stretching back to think even the 1750s, but Howe's sewing machine brought together a lot of different capacities that made it kinda the best sewing machine."
Social Studies,"And it will be even further refined by Isaac Singer, who we associate today with the Singer Sewing Machine. And so these massive textile mills really become the backbone of New England commerce. But, they never would have gotten started without another invention, which was the cotton gin. And the cotton gin was invented by Eli Whitney in 1793."
Social Studies,"And what's important about the cotton gin, so here's the gin, and basically it's kind of a box with some spikes on it that allows you to take these balls of cotton and separate them from the seeds. And separating cotton from the seeds was an extremely labor-intensive process. If you've never held a ball of cotton, it's extremely sticky, so you kinda have to wade through the little bits of cotton, pull out these seeds. It takes forever."
Social Studies,"And so an average day's work would not produce all that much cotton that was ready for market. Well, Whitney completely revolutionizes this with the cotton gin. These little spikes help separate the cotton seeds from the cotton ball, and revolutionizes how much cotton can be produced by a single person in a single day. Whitney's cotton gin made it possible for a single person to process 50 pounds of cotton in a single day, which is just an order of magnitude more than they were able to do beforehand."
Social Studies,This is really interesting 'cause it had kind of a massive human cost in the form of really bolstering the institution of slavery in the American South because when farming cotton was so labor-intensive it really wasn't very profitable; and so the institution of slavery was actually starting to die out a little bit.
Social Studies,"Before the 1790s people were saying: ""Eh, I don't know if it's actually worth it to keep slaves."" So if it weren't for the cotton gin, the United States might actually have outlawed slavery considerably earlier than it ended up doing in the 1860s."
Social Studies,"So it's interesting to note that even though these inventions really changed the fabric of American society, allowed some people to earn money who had never been able to earn money before, it also meant that the institution of slavery was really entrenched in the United States and would only continue to expand until the 1860s. So that's a little bit of a peak into the human cost of The Industrial Revolution."
Social Studies,And we'll get more into what some of those costs were and what some of the benefits were in the next video..
Social Studies,"All of these were altered in the first half of the 19th century, thanks to a couple of simultaneous trends. The Industrial Revolution in which new technologies were developed to make production more efficient and revolutions in transportation and communication, which made it easier to get goods and people to far distances more quickly and to communicate over considerable distances more quickly."
Social Studies,"And these really resulted in a reorganization of American society that some historians have actually said was more revolutionary than the American Revolution. So in the last video, we discussed some of the new technologies which changed American work in the early 19th century."
Social Studies,"One of these was the introduction of the textile mill, which was powered by a water wheel, by Samuel Slater, which helped textile mills become the chief industry of New England, also helped women start working outside the home in the Lowell Mills, started by Charles Lowell and also began the system by which factory owners would hire individuals, rather than family units, to work for wages in their factories."
Social Studies,"The other major invention that had a really important impact on American society was the cotton gin, which was a machine that separated cotton seeds from the fiber and it made the production of cotton considerably more profitable. And so, with cotton a profitable crop, the American south really invested in cotton and investing in cotton as its main cash crop meant they really entrenched the system of slavery."
Social Studies,"So even though in the 1780s, early 1790s, many southern states were thinking perhaps they'd abolish slavery because the institution was not overly profitable, as cotton became the cash crop of the south, the institution of slavery would be entrenched and continue to grow until the 1860s. So those are some of the new technologies of production. In this video, I wanna spend some time talking about the revolution in communication and transportation that happened also in this time period."
Social Studies,"So just like inventions like the textile mill or the cotton gin made it easier to work faster, inventions in transportation and communication in the early 19th century also made it possible to transport goods faster and to transport information faster. So I wanna talk about just a few of these transportation inventions. One of these was the railroad. Now, the railroad was not invented in the United States."
Social Studies,"Rather, the United States imported the railroad technology from England and Germany and this is one of the very first railroads in the United States, I think it's kind of adorable 'cause you can see how it still is really owing a debt, stylistically, to a wagon. Even looks like a wagon here on the end. So railroads begin to come into the United States in the early 1800s and first they're mostly for cargo or helping to move stone, things to help build canals, which we'll get to in a second."
Social Studies,"But soon they're also passenger rail stations. And the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, or B&O railroad, which you may know from your Monopoly board was one of the first passenger rail lines in the United States. Another major transportation revolution of this time period was shipping on water."
Social Studies,"So, in 1807, inventor Robert Fulton came up with the steamship and so a steamship, and you can see the little smokestacks right here, makes it much easier to power the ship and one thing you can do then is go against the tide of a river, so instead of just, for example, going down the Mississippi River to the port of New Orleans, you can also go back up the Mississippi River which means commerce can go more easily in both directions. Another major innovation of the time period are canals."
Social Studies,"And this here is a map of the Erie Canal, which was completed in 1825 and a canal is a relatively narrow, relatively shallow waterway but it still allows cargo barges to move across what otherwise would be really hard to navigate territory, so, you know, it's hard to see here, but there are mountains here, right. So, now you can take cargo across mountains, across large stretches of land by ship, which is much faster than trying to do it on foot or with a wagon."
Social Studies,"I think it's actually hard for us to imagine now, but in the early 19th century and really for most of time before then, waterways were the highways of the world. It was a lot easier to get from Boston to London across the Atlantic by ship than it would have been to get from Boston to the Appalachian Mountains on foot. Before the invention of air travel, before the Interstate Highway System, and really, up until the invention of the railroad, waterways were the easiest way to get around in the world."
Social Studies,"And the last communication revolution that I wanna talk about is the invention of the telegraph, which a portrait painter-turned-inventor named Samuel Morse first patented in 1844 and Morse invented Morse Code because the telegraph worked by sending pulses down copper wires and so it made it easy to communicate through coded messages of dots and dashes."
Social Studies,"So, dots and dashes corresponded with letters which allowed you to send messages over extremely long distances, so you could send a message by telegraph in an instant, as opposed to sending a letter, which might take days or even weeks to get to its destination. So, all of these revolutions in transportation and communication kind of translate into two major transformations in American business at this time period."
Social Studies,"One, is that the scope of business that you can do is much greater because now, if you're a farmer who lives in, say, Rochester, your radius of... your radius of people you can sell your produce to before it goes bad is considerably larger. Now, instead of just being able to get to where you can get maybe in a wagon's trip of a day, you can send your crops on the Erie Canal and suddenly, you're dealing with a much larger market."
Social Studies,"So, they're not only creating a national web of commerce, they're also creating an international web of commerce because these canals and steamships go to international ports which mean that you can now do business from the western part of New York with people who live in London."
Social Studies,"And the other thing that increases here is the pace of business, right, so instead of having to negotiate a business deal through a series of letters, which might take you many weeks, now you can negotiate a business deal by the telegraph and it's only gonna take you a couple of days. Likewise, it might have taken you weeks to send your logs for example, down the Mississippi River. Now you have them in a steamship and it takes just a couple of days."
Social Studies,"So there's an overall expansion in the number of people who can participate in markets. The expansion of the distance at which you can participate in a market and the pace at which you can do it. You can do business much faster with these revolutions in transportation and communication. And in the next video, I'll talk more about how these transformations in technology and the scope and pace of American business affected the society of the United States in the early 19th century.."
Social Studies,"Now this is from a slightly later period, but I think it gives you a good sense of what it was like to work in a textile factory. With the Market Revolution really comes the emergence of factory labor in the United States. And there are a couple of ways that, that's important. One is that people start working for wages. It's a move away from subsistence farming and a barter economy, which also means that people aren't necessarily in charge of themselves anymore."
Social Studies,"And there's a lot that goes along with that, which means that people stop being their own bosses. Instead, they report to other bosses. And that can be problematic because it means that you have a lot less control over your daily life. So imagine that you're a farmer and you're really sick. Oh well, you know maybe you don't plant some seed that day and you do it the next day. Imagine that you work at a textile mill and you get really sick, you don't report to work and you get fired."
Social Studies,"So people are no longer able to set the pace of their own lives by and large. And with things like interchangeable parts, for example, fewer and fewer artisans, so masters of a craft, are making goods from start to finish. So it used to be perhaps you would be a master shoemaker, a master cobbler, and you would make every part of that shoe from tanning the leather to nailing in the sole."
Social Studies,"The system of interchangeable parts, which will later become even more codified as the assembly-line system, means that most people are only doing one part of a task. So instead of doing all of making a shoe and saying at the end of it, ""I made this shoe, ""I am a master maker of shoes,"" now your entire job might just be to hammer in one nail and then hand off the shoe to the next person."
Social Studies,"So there's never anything that you can point to and say, ""I made that."" So a lot of people say that this is a period when people stop being able to take pride in their own work or at least not as much pride. But what's even more important about this process of interchangeable parts, assembly-line labor, is that it leads to an overall, what they call, deskilling. So removing the skill from labor."
Social Studies,"And what's important about that is that if you've broken down a task into enough small parts that you've got people literally hammering in the same nail on a different shoe 12 hours a day, then you don't necessarily need highly trained artisans to do that. And what happens if you are not highly trained, we'll call this unskilled labor, and you decide you want to strike for higher pay? Well, your boss doesn't need to train anyone to hammer in that nail so you'll just get fired."
Social Studies,"So it makes the labor force in general a little bit more precarious because you don't need an exceptional skill to have a factory job, but you are easily replaced. All right, let's talk about entry into a market system. Now what do I mean by this? In this time period, the United States develops what's called a market economy."
Social Studies,"And that's different from what most people had been doing up until that point because people in the United States had mainly shipped raw materials over to Europe, England particularly, to be processed and made into finished goods. And this is similar to the system of mercantilism that you might be familiar with from the colonial era. Well, the war of 1812 and some of the conflict leading up to it, led the United States to embargo England, which was a manufacturing center."
Social Studies,"So people couldn't send their raw materials there. They responded by investing in their own factories. So the war of 1812 is actually a pretty important moment for the development of domestic industrialization at home. And so now, instead of this kind of import/export or barter economy, people are making deals with other investors all over the United States, all over the world. So this gives people an opportunity to invest and to speculate."
Social Studies,"And that means that as they're a part of an international market of investment speculation, they're prone to the kinds of booms and busts that characterize capitalism, right? Now we often think of the Great Depression as having been the first major American depression. But really, it was the largest and most recent up until that point, because after the war of 1812, the United States kinda goes through approximately a 20-year cycle of boom and bust."
Social Studies,"So boom is when things are getting better, things are looking up, the economy is going really well, and then a bubble of some kind bursts. And in 1819, they had the very first of these bubbles burst, it's called the Panic of 1819 in land speculation. And this is the first time that the United States had actually experienced any kind of economic depression. So imagine how frightening that would have been to them."
Social Studies,"One of the hardest things about market-based capitalism is that individuals don't really have control over the larger market. It's not one person that made the Great Depression happen. It was an overall loss in consumer confidence or perhaps overproduction, right? If too many people are supplying the same commodity, the price is dropping through the laws of supply and demand."
Social Studies,"So now, the laws of supply and demand and the pressures of an international market are really changing the nature of American commerce because they're enmeshed in that market. And that has all kinds of political and social ramifications for the United States."
Social Studies,"Understanding the volatility of belonging to an international market kind of helps explain why Andrew Jackson was so obsessed with the National Bank at this time period, right? Because it represents this confusing matrix of international supply and demand and people getting credit or not getting credit."
Social Studies,"And being part of this international market is something that's going to have a major effect on the American South, and particularly the enslaved population that lives in the American South because they're going to be supplying cotton to the world's textile mills. And those are textile mills in New England and textile mills in England. And as the world demands cotton for processing, the South is going to supply that cotton, which is picked by enslaved individuals."
Social Studies,"And one of the reasons that the Confederacy believes that it can succeed as an independent nation is because they're supplying cotton to England. And when England managed to find its own supply of cotton from Egypt and India, the economic chances of the Confederacy were sunk. And the last thing that I think is related to this Market Revolution is the Second Great Awakening."
Social Studies,"Now I don't wanna go into too much detail about this because of a whole separate series of videos about the Second Great Awakening, but this Second Great Awakening was kind of an explosion of religious fervor, which was happening at almost exactly the same time as the Market Revolution. And many American historians actually think that it's these confusing and confounding and anxious forces that lead a lot of people to take up religion."
Social Studies,"Because as the world is changing around them, as people now have to relate in different ways to their neighbors as bosses and employees rather than bartering partners, and as they're swept up in international markets that are outside their control, people look for new explanations and comfort in an increasingly confusing world. So that's one explanation for the Second Great Awakening."
Social Studies,"So I started out this series of videos by saying that some historians have argued that the Market Revolution was actually more revolutionary than the American Revolution. Now that's a difficult question to answer because we're talking about a revolution in politics as opposed to kind of a revolution of economics. But I will say that though the American Revolution dissolved the political bonds between the United States and Great Britain, its social and economic impact were relatively limited."
Social Studies,"Most people kind of ended up in the same place socially after the American Revolution as they were before it. But the Market Revolution changes an awful lot in American society in terms of how they participate internationally and how people organize their daily lives. So I think there is a strong argument to be made that this revolution of economics, technology, even religion, is considerably farther reaching than the American Revolution.."
Social Studies,"The spoils system. Even some aspects of American political character that are still with us today emerged in this time period and by that, I mean the kinds of traits that we like to see in our politicians to consider them electable. So in this series on Jacksonian democracy, I'm gonna take you on a journey from the earlier American political culture, some of the major changes that came about in the Jacksonian period, and then just discuss some of the ways that this still influences us today."
Social Studies,"All right, so if Jacksonian democracy was a new thing, what came before it? Well, in the very early era of American political life and I'm talking here from approximately 1790 to about 1820, American politics was very aristocratic. There were a couple of families that tended to dominate politics. The Adams family, for example. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and these men were kind of considered to be, maybe a higher character of man."
Social Studies,"They were the quintessential citizens of a republic and along with that came a certain amount of wealth and status and education. In between George Washington and Andrew Jackson, every single person who served as president had a college degree. Many of them were Virginians and particularly Virginian planters. You see a lot of Virginians and a lot of people from Massachusetts in the first couple of years of the republic."
Social Studies,"Many of them kind of shared a concern that there could be too much democracy, shall we say, that even though the United States was a democracy, many of the founders of the United States worried about the tyranny of the majority, the tyranny of the mob, that they had set up this democratic experiment where many people could vote, but they were afraid of having just too many people voting 'cause they looked down on lower classes of society in that time period."
Social Studies,"They worried that if you didn't have a stake in the country, usually shown by property ownership, either in terms of land or in terms of wealth, then you wouldn't have the proper investment in the fate of the nation in order to make a rational decision about what sort of policies should be enacted. So in the early years of the United States, many states had voting laws that restricted the franchise to just propertied men."
Social Studies,"So really, a quite small proportion of the overall populous of the United States could vote."
Social Studies,"Interestingly, this actually meant that in some northern states, both free people of color, free black men and women could vote because they met the requirements for property ownership, but in the early 1800s, 1810s, these ideals of democracy began to catch on more and more among the common people and as new states joined The Union, like Ohio and Illinois, they came in with state constitutions, saying that all white male citizens could vote, regardless of whether or not they owned property or they paid taxes."
Social Studies,"So in this time period, white male citizenship became associated with voting and some of the other states began to rewrite their state constitutions to grant the vote to all white males and it probably won't surprise you that when they rewrote those laws, they managed to take out the little loophole for free people of color and women with certain amounts of property."
Social Studies,"So by the end of this period, in the 1850s, all property requirements for voting had been eliminated and any white male above the age of 21 in the United States had the right to vote and we'll get to what that meant for American politics in the next video.."
Social Studies,"He would stand for office. You wouldn't promote yourself, that would be vulgar. Instead, you would have men of well-known character promote you. But by the 1820s, very few Americans believed in the idea that there could be such a thing as too much democracy that you would have to avoid the mob rule. Instead, they wanted the mob rule. They wanted a great expansion of democracy and that was to them the real character of the United States."
Social Studies,"Now I should also mention that this expansion of democracy was part of a larger international expansion of democracy. Similar laws that eliminated property restrictions on voting were also being passed in England and France at this time period. So there's kind of an international wave to broaden the franchise, but the extension of voting in Europe is nothing like the extension of voting in the United States."
Social Studies,"There are nearly twice as many eligible voters in the United States in the 1830s as there are in Britain with a population that's half the size. So while European nations are taking small steps toward expanding the franchise, the United States is taking huge steps in this time period. So the first election where we start to see the influence of this new wave of voters is in the election of 1824 and let me give us a little bit more space to talk about this."
Social Studies,"So the election of 1824 was a contest between John Quincy Adams, son of American founder John Adams, Andrew Jackson, famous war hero from the War of 1812, the victor of the Battle of New Orleans, and Henry Clay, who will become known as the great compromiser for having pretty much spent his entire political career either running for president or putting together some kind of compromise. Now, John Quincy Adams I think kind of epitomized the older school of American democracy."
Social Studies,"He was reticent to campaign on his own behalf. He was very interested in academics and internal improvements. He didn't really see himself as being part of a particular political party. In fact, all three of these men were actually running as republicans 'cause in the era of good feelings there's only the Republican Party. So you can see how confusing this might as been as a voter to have three different candidates from the same party and they're supposed to be different than each other."
Social Studies,"So in this election, Andrew Jackson wins the popular vote and John Quincy Adams wins the electoral vote and Henry Clay wins neither. Now in a situation like this, who got to be president was decided by the House of Representatives. Well guess who was speaker of the house. Henry Clay. So he's out of the running himself, but he is in a position to make quite an impact on who wins the presidency. Well John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay didn't have a whole lot of common, but they sure both hated Andrew Jackson."
Social Studies,"So Clay and Adams meet and Henry Clay says, ""Yeah John Q., ""I'll see if I can get the House to vote for you,"" and that's what happens. So the House elects John Quincy Adams president and then just a couple days later, John Quincy Adams says that Henry Clay will get to be his Secretary of State, which was quite a plum of a political position and Andrew Jackson and his supporters go ballistic."
Social Studies,They say that this was a corrupt bargain behind closed doors in which John Quincy Adams bribed Henry Clay to give him the presidency in exchange for this political position.
Social Studies,"Now, there's no evidence that this actual corrupt bargain really happened, but even if it did, it was totally in line with the earlier playbook of American democracy, a you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours kind of situation where the better sort of men, the higher men of character made a deal between themselves of who would lead this nation and the outrage over this possible collusion between Adams and Clay really signaled that the old days of a couple of people making decisions about American politics were over, that this kind of deal between statesmen was now seen as undemocratic or crooked or something that was done behind closed doors and that was against the American character and Andrew Jackson is really going to ride his wave of popular discontent over someone winning the popular vote, but losing the electoral vote due to in his mind a corrupt bargain right into the presidency in the election of 1828 and we'll get to that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"This is the kind of elitist hokum that we do not need in our nation of free white men. So, four years later in the election of 1828, it is a Jackson/John Quincy Adams rematch and the gloves are off. So, in the first video in this series, I mentioned that during this time period, a lot of the aspects that we consider part of American politics first came to the fore."
Social Studies,"And one of the things that you'll see in the election of 1828, really for the first time, is down and dirty mudslinging, or making angry attacks ad hominem, or at the man, rather than at his principles, attacks on your opponent. So, Andrew Jackson probably already had all the ammunition he needed with the corrupt bargain of 1824. John Quincy Adams kinda considered himself above this kind of mudslinging. But his supporters did not, and they came out with some real gems."
Social Studies,"Not only did they put out handbills with coffins, this is known as the Coffin Handbill to this day, detailing how many men had been killed by Andrew Jackson, either through execution or duels, they also accused his mother of being a prostitute and his wife of being a bigamist. In fact, Andrew Jackson's wife died shortly before his inauguration and he believed to his dying day that it was the terrible slanders about her that had led to her untimely death."
Social Studies,"Another first for the election of 1828 is Andrew Jackson as the first candidate for the Democratic Party. This is a new party united around Jackson. In the previous election, all of the candidates had been Republicans in one form or another, but now the Republican Party is going to start to fade away and the Democratic Party will come to the fore. And this is the same Democratic Party that is still in existence in the United States today."
Social Studies,"Of course, its goals and ideas have changed a great deal since the 1820s. And with his Democratic Party and even with the supporters of John Quincy Adams, what Jackson taps into is this kind of mass party democracy. He has great party machines working for him in Eastern cities."
Social Studies,"He also really takes advantage particularly of people on the frontier, so white people who are looking to expand westward to kind of make it, as we would say, rugged individuals, people pulling themselves up by their bootstraps and they saw that in Andrew Jackson because he had been born fairly penniless. And then, by the time he was elected president in 1828, he had become part of the frontier elite. He was now a slave holder; he was one of the guys who had made it."
Social Studies,"But those on the frontier looked to him and saw the example of what they wanted to be. Jackson also had the advantage of being a war hero from the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. And throughout the 19th century, those with valorous military service will do well in national elections. And another thing that Andrew Jackson does quite well is harnesses anti-Indian, anti-Native American sentiment."
Social Studies,"John Quincy Adams had attempted to bargain in good faith, to try to hold up the side of the United States with Native American nations living in what was then the territorial borders of the United States. He'd bargained with them as if they were sovereign nations unto themselves."
Social Studies,"Andrew Jackson understood that white settlers desperately wanted Indian lands and he played to those white settlers, assuring him that he would do his utmost to remove Native Americans from those lands, a promise that he will make good on during his presidency. So, Jackson wins the election of 1828 and immediately it's obvious that the democracy under Jackson is quite different from the American system under previous presidents."
Social Studies,"At his inauguration, he turns to the crowd and bows, signaling that he thinks of himself as being beneath the people that he's serving. He also opens up the White House during what's called the Inaugural Brawl, and it's believed that many people went into the White House and they wrecked the china and they destroyed the furniture and they wouldn't leave until people told them there was alcohol outside on the lawn."
Social Studies,"And to an earlier generation who had been raised with this early American aristocracy of the Adamses and the Washingtons, this looks like anarchy. They thought this was the beginning of the French Revolution in the United States. It was not, but it was the beginning of massive party politics, political campaigns, and the beginning of a new politics in the United States that appealed to the common man. And we'll talk more about that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"And particularly the growing numbers of frontier settlers, who not only wanted to vote for the first president to be born in the west, also supported Jackson because he was known for his anti-Native American sentiment and his promise to remove Native Americans from lands that whites wanted to settle east of the Mississippi. So in the first video in this series, I mentioned that most scholars point to this moment of Jackson's election in 1828 as the beginning of modern democracy."
Social Studies,"So let's investigate some of those claims a little bit further. So what was it about Jackson's election and presidency that began the modern American political system? Well, for one thing Jackson was the very first democratic president, as in the first president to be a modern-day democrat. And this is the same democratic party that we still have today. And Jackson really mobilized this sentiment of the party of the common man."
Social Studies,"And in his idea that meant the common white man, that he was not one of these eastern elites, banking elites, who made their fortunes by nickel-and-diming other people. He was a backwoods frontiersman, a war hero, someone who had pulled himself up by his bootstrap. So he was, I guess, one of the earliest self-made men."
Social Studies,"And it was clear from the get-go that the age of Jackson was going to be a completely different kind of political culture than had existed previously because at his inauguration he had a giant inaugural celebration, he opened up the White House to anybody. The rabble came in and they trashed the place, and the older aristocratic class of Washington politicians thought that this was more or less the end of the republic as they knew it. This was going to be the era of mob rule."
Social Studies,"But, you know, the wheels didn't come off democracy. And one thing that Jackson really did was he rewarded his supporters. He rewarded the people who had voted Democrat, who saw themselves as part of the Democratic Party with government positions. And this is called the spoils system, along the lines of to the victor, go the spoils. So to reward the democratic machine that had put him in office, he kicked out earlier office-holders and rewarded the Democrats with offices."
Social Studies,"That was very common in this time period for people to be, who are known as office seekers, to kinda hang out in Washington, D.C. trying to get the president to appoint you postmaster of some random place so that you could draw a government salary. Now, earlier presidents would have thought something like rewarding an office seeker quite vulgar. John Quincy Adams, for example, refused to replace anyone who was actually doing a good job in their government post with someone who was one of his supporters."
Social Studies,"So you can debate whether or not this is actually a good thing, to kick out people who are good at their job in favor of people who have supported you during the campaign. But what it does is it keeps people in the party. So it makes sure that even if the party loses, they know that they have put in their labor for the Democratic Party and later for the Whig and Republican Party. And so they're going to keep working to put their candidate in office so that they can reap some rewards."
Social Studies,"So this is one way in which Jackson kind of solidifies party politics so that you stop just being a Jackson partisan, a Jefferson partisan, someone who follows a political candidate. And remember that earlier political candidates kind of stood as men of virtue, right? Now, the virtue is shifting from the men themselves to the party that they represent."
Social Studies,"And this party system was cemented by 1832 when Jackson was reelected, when they held a national nominating convention, it sounds very familiar to us today, and put out an official party platform. So what else did Jackson do that was really influential? Ironically, for someone billing himself as a man of the people, Jackson worked really hard to expand the power of the Executive Branch."
Social Studies,"So he wanted the presidency to be as powerful, if not more powerful, than the Judicial Branch or the Legislative Branch of the United States, more powerful than the Supreme Court or Congress. And there were two major instances where he shows his interest in becoming the most powerful part of the American government."
Social Studies,"One of these was and what's known as the Bank War when Jackson attempted to kill the bank of the United States, and he succeeded, because he thought that the national bank was corrupt, that it benefited the elite, that it deserved more oversight from the federal government, some of which was true. And when congress tried to recharter the national bank, he vetoed the charter. Basically saying that he felt that his vote was more important than the vote of Congress."
Social Studies,"And for this, a group of people who started to coalesce around their hatred for Jackson started calling him King Andrew the First because Jackson used the power of the veto all the time, because he was trying to, in some ways, reduce the power of the federal government, which was one of the key tenants of the Democratic Party, but at the same time kind of increase his own power because he used his veto in many cases to further his own agenda."
Social Studies,"And as much as the national bank was not a great institution, it did help to keep the United States' economy more or less humming along. And once Jackson killed it, there was a major economic depression called the Panic of 1837, which we can lay pretty much squarely at Jackson's feet. We can see this political cartoon here has him trampling on the constitution as he pushes his own agenda forward."
Social Studies,"And it's through their hatred of Jackson that a new group comes together, the Whig Party, which will provide the second half of the two-party system that comes to the fore in this time period. So this is Andrew Jackson arguing that the president has more power than Congress. There's the second example of Andrew Jackson trying to argue that he had more power than the Supreme Court, which comes comes in the Trail of Tears."
Social Studies,"So Andrew Jackson represented the interests of white settlers who really saw Native Americans as no more than an obstacle to their continuous push westward, the availability of land, which they saw really as the cornerstone of American prosperity. And I can't do justice to the entire Trail of Tears here. We have an article about that and there'll be more to come in the future."
Social Studies,"But suffice it to say that the American Indians, who were living in Georgia particularly and who were known as the Five Civilized Tribes because they had adopted many of the ways of the Europeans including Christianity and in some cases slavery, the Supreme Court ruled that they were entitled to be treated as a sovereign nation. So when Georgia is trying to remove Native Americans from their lands in Georgia, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, John Marshall, rules in their favor."
Social Studies,"And Andrew Jackson was quoted as saying, ""John Marshall has made his decision. ""Now let him enforce it."" So even though the Supreme Court defended the status of the Native Americans living in Georgia east of the Mississippi in general, Andrew Jackson and the state of Georgia went ahead with forcing the Five Civilized Tribes to move westward to Oklahoma during which at least 3,000 people died. So Andrew Jackson serves a second term and finishes out his presidency in 1836."
Social Studies,"He considered running for a third term, decided against it. Instead, his crony Martin Van Buren, who's basically Andrew Jackson Jr., serves as president for one term. But due to the Panic of 1837, Martin Van Buren, like poor Herbert Hoover later, is forced to deal with an economic depression. And you know that people are never happy with the incumbent president when there's an economic decline."
Social Studies,"So in the election of 1840, the Whigs, the opposition party to Andrew Jackson, run William Henry Harrison as their candidate. And he is mostly famous for being a fellow who died in office after only 40 days. But what's interesting about William Henry Harrison's campaign is that the Whigs have learned their lesson about the political climate of the Jacksonian age."
Social Studies,"They marketed William Henry Harrison as having been born in a log cabin, a war hero, he was a man of the people, just a common guy who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps. Now, none of this was true. William Henry Harrison was from Virginia, he was from a very wealthy family, he had been college educated. He was no more rough and tumble than John Quincy Adams had been. But the Whigs had learned a valuable lesson about what American political culture was like in the age of mass democracy."
Social Studies,"And from this point forward, it's clear that Americans don't like their politicians too highfalutin and woe betide any candidate who wasn't born in a log cabin, the modern American political system had begun.."
Social Studies,"Political parties were in their infancy, infrastructure was practically non-existent, and one disastrous war with a world power, with the likes of Great Britain or France, could easily have wiped it out. But fast forward to 1848, less than 50 years later, and by then the United States had developed a great deal as a unified independent nation."
Social Studies,"It occupied a vast amount of territory in North America, trains and steamships transported goods to distant markets, factories churned out textiles, and politics saw the rise and fall of not one, but two party systems. Despite all this growth, in 1848 the United States was just 12 years away from the onset of an incredibly bloody civil war that pitted Southern states against the U.S. government. This seems like quite a contradiction."
Social Studies,"Over the course of the first half of the 19th century, was the United States developing a unified national identity? Or were its geographic sections developing a divided regional identity, barely held together by the Constitution? What we're doing here really is asking a historical question. If you saw this on the AP exam, the question might look something like this. Explain the extent to which politics, economics, and foreign policy promoted the development of the American identity from 1800 to 1848."
Social Studies,"Sounds pretty fancy schmancy. But we can translate that to a simpler question. What tied the United States together as a country over the course of 1800 to 1848, and what split it apart? To answer this, let's review what happened in this period in these three areas, politics, economics, and foreign policy, and see if we think they contributed to a unified American identity or a divided regional identity. And just to remind you this is a big overview of the historical developments from 1800 to 1848."
Social Studies,"I'm not gonna take a lot of time here to explain everything in depth, but if you find that you're unfamiliar with some of the things we discuss, make a note of it and then go back to review that concept when you've got some time. Okay, as we set about to answer this question, let's just brainstorm some of the major political, economic, and foreign policy developments in this time period. It doesn't have to be an exhaustive list of everything that happened, just some key highlights."
Social Studies,"I'll suggest a few, but feel free to pause the video and see what you can think of on your own. Alright, what happened in politics? Well, there was the development of political parties. First, the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans, and then later on they were replaced with the Jacksonian Democrats and the Whigs. There was the expansion of the right to vote to almost all white men in this era, and there were a lot of political controversies."
Social Studies,"Two that come to mind are the Missouri Compromise and the Nullification Crisis. So which of these things contributed to a unified identity, and which contributed to a regional identity? Well, I would say that the Missouri Compromise and the Nullification Crisis were both examples of regional identity trumping American identity, since they concerned the balance of power between free states and slave states, and whether states or the Federal Government should have the final say."
Social Studies,"The expansion of the right to vote seems like a point for unification to me since it celebrated American democracy as the birthright of white men from all states. On political parties, I might say this is inconclusive. There are elements of both unity and division among them since political parties weren't exclusively defined by region in this time period, but they were often defined by how much power they believed the Federal Government should have compared to the states. Okay, on to economics."
Social Studies,"Major developments in this time period include the Market Revolution, the controversy over tariffs, and the increasing separation between the economies of the industrial North and the agricultural South. Of these, I would say that separate economic systems definitely promoted a divided regional identity. The controversy over tariffs also promoted divisions in that Southern plantation owners thought that tariffs gave advantage to Northern manufacturers at their expense."
Social Studies,"The Market Revolution is a bit tricky to categorize. It promoted some ties between the sections because it became easier to conduct business over long distances due to innovations in transportation and communication. But a lot of the major networks of transportation and communication connected the North and the West to each other, not the South. Lastly, foreign policy. In this era there was the War of 1812, as well as westward expansion that caused conflict with Native Americans and with Mexico."
Social Studies,"I'd say that the War of 1812 was a force that brought Americans together in a shared sense of patriotism following victories like the Battle of New Orleans. The westward expansion was a bit more of a mixed bag. In general, most white Americans supported the concept of Manifest Destiny and thought that the removal of Native Americans for that purpose was justified."
Social Studies,"But westward expansion also led to regional conflict because the admission of new states into the Union threatened the balance of power between free and slave states in Congress. So based on the evidence we've gathered here, let's see if we can formulate a thesis statement to answer this question. The prompt is asking us to evaluate the extent to which developments in politics, economics, and foreign policy promoted the development of an American identity."
Social Studies,"So I think that we want to approach this not as an either-or, or a yes-no question, but rather a question of degree. I would say that the overall evidence here points to a divided regional identity with a few points of unity. Americans agreed that the United States needed to expand, and that democracy was the birthright of all white men, but in almost every other aspect of politics, economics, and foreign policy they were divided along sectional lines."
Social Studies,"Would you come to the same conclusion? Remember this is only one way of answering this question. You may have come up with some different examples, or you might interpret these examples in a different way than I have, and that's okay. The next step now that you've evaluated your evidence and composed your thesis statement, is to think about how you might arrange the thoughts you've gathered here into an argumentative essay.."
Social Studies,"So church membership really soared and lots of new people joined churches, particularly women. Now, you'll note that this is called The Second Great Awakening because there was, in fact, a First Great Awakening, which happened in the 1730s, 1740s and that was the era of Jonathan Edwards and sinners in the hands of an angry God."
Social Studies,"It was very localized in New England and specifically, with Calvinism or Puritan religious awakenings, so that was a separate event that happened about 100 years before and The Second Great Awakening, as I have drawn here, generally, historians say it lasted from about 1790 to 1850, but I would say that the real heyday of The Second Great Awakening would be from about 1820 to 1840. Those are hazy dates, but that's kind of the hot period of The Second Great Awakening."
Social Studies,"In this series of videos, I wanna explore some of the aspects that led to The Second Great Awakening, particularly the market revolution and a bunch of other social, political, cultural, and even religious changes that were happening beforehand and then also explore some of the consequences of The Second Great Awakening."
Social Studies,"What parts of early 19th century American culture are really tied up with this wave in religiosity? So what was The Second Great Awakening like? Well, here's a painting of what I would call kind of the central aspect of The Second Great Awakening, which were camp meetings. So unlike The First Great Awakening, which was definitely a New England thing, The Second Great Awakening took place largely more on the Western part of the United States."
Social Studies,"Now, when we're talking about Western part, we're talking about Western part circa 1820, which is gonna be Western New York, Kentucky, around Appalachia. These were places that didn't have the kind of strong established church religion that you might have found in a place like Massachusetts and so preachers would set up camp meetings. They'd have a big stage."
Social Studies,"People would come in tents and they would listen to these preachers and these preachers would attempt to convert the audiences to a more active and particularly, evangelical form of Christianity."
Social Studies,"Evangelical Christianity comes from this word, evangelical, evangelist, like the four evangelists of the Bible, who were the men who wrote the gospels and the idea of evangelical Christianity was a real strong attachment to the Bible and an attempt to make kind of heaven on Earth, so to make the world below the same as heaven above."
Social Studies,"So they're kind of trying to bring about a terrestrial paradise, if you will and many of the religious movements that come out of this are particularly concerned with what we would call, really, the apocalypse or in more contemporary terms, sort of millennialism or millenarianism. I know this is a big word, but more or less, the idea that they want Jesus Christ to return to Earth and rule for 1,000 years over a perfect earthly paradise."
Social Studies,"Now, when you and I think of the apocalypse, we usually think that's a bad thing, but most evangelical Christians in this time period really wanted the apocalypse to happen because it meant that heaven would happen on Earth. Now, these camp meetings were really interesting. You know, they're happening kind of out on the frontier, so it's kinda the coolest show in town, to go see this itinerant preacher."
Social Studies,"They're often called circuit riders, so that is a preacher who literally rides around on a horse because he does not have an established congregation of his own, so he goes from town to town, setting up meetings, preaching, and hopefully converting people to evangelical Christianity, but the camp meetings of The Second Great Awakening were characterized by a really emotional response from individuals. People who were having conversion experiences and you can see it here in this painting."
Social Studies,"They would kinda go into fits. They might fall over and shake or bark like a dog because they had been so overcome by this religious spirit. So you can imagine how camp meetings like this, as people heard about them, would've really affected the general populous."
Social Studies,"If you heard about a story where your friend went off to this camp meeting and they had this incredible conversion experience where they realized how important it was to give up sin and devote one's life to Christianity and working to bring heaven on Earth, you might go check it out yourself."
Social Studies,"So two of the most famous preachers of The Second Great Awakening were Lyman Beecher, who was based out of Ohio later in his life, and you might be familiar with this name, Beecher, because Lyman Beecher was the father of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin. One of Beecher's concerns was just that society in general in the United States was becoming more secular and taking a very rational approach to religion, as opposed to an emotional approach to religion."
Social Studies,"He wanted people to feel religion very deeply. He was kind of working toward a period of religious revival and got one in The Second Great Awakening. The other really famous preacher from this time period was Charles Grandison Finney and Finney traveled around and drew just crowds in the thousands. 20,000, 30,000 people might gather to hear him preach and you can notice here that I have Finney and Beecher facing away from each other 'cause they didn't entirely get along."
Social Studies,"One of the reasons they didn't get along was because Finney approved of women preaching in public, which was definitely a no-no for the time period. So what was unique and new about the theology of The Second Great Awakening? Well, let me give myself a little bit more space here. Well, I've already mentioned some things here."
Social Studies,"One that, it's taking place out on the frontier in huge ecstatic camp meetings where people were behaving in a way that would have been very strange in a Puritan church, falling down, shaking, shouting aloud and also that it was concerned with this idea of millenarianism or trying to create heaven on Earth to bring about the rapture, to bring about the return of Jesus Christ to Earth for 1,000-year reign."
Social Studies,"Also, that it served to inspire many converts to be better people, to do good on Earth, to try to bring about this heaven on Earth. Now, contrast this with some of the religious establishment in the United States, specifically the Puritans. Right, Puritans were Calvinists, which meant that they followed the doctrine of John Calvin, which meant that they believed in predestination."
Social Studies,"Predestination is the idea that before you're born, God already knows and has decided whether or not you are saved, one of the elect or whether you are damned and going to hell, so there's really nothing you can do because either you are one of these elect or you're one of the damned, so your personal actions make no difference in whether or not you're going to get into heaven. The Second Great Awakening really kinda rejects this notion. You can see that in kinda two different ways."
Social Studies,"One, they do think that it matters if you do good, right? So your time on Earth is not just kind of wading through a veil of tears, waiting until you get to heaven or don't, depending on what your status is, so doing good works, trying to improve the world around you does make a difference in your salvation and we'll see as this goes forward how that really animates people toward all kinds of social reforms in this time period. The other thing this does is really democratizes religion."
Social Studies,"Right, if the world isn't already separated into the elect and the damned, then anyone has a chance of salvation and you see that in many aspects of The Second Great Awakening. They allow women to preach. Women become really strong members, influential members of these communities of faith. They preach to whites, blacks, free, and enslaved people alike, so all races are eligible for salvation and you also don't have to be a wealthy church father to be influential in religion."
Social Studies,"You know, people like Lyman Beecher and Charles Finney. They weren't born wealthy. They weren't born as the scions of, say, the Mather family in Massachusetts, which had been one of the most important religious families in Massachusetts, so The Second Great Awakening really attracted lots of poor people, people on the frontier. It wasn't a religion of the elite. Now you don't have to be educated at the seminaries of Harvard or Yale to have a Christian conversion experience."
Social Studies,"So this is the essence of The Second Great Awakening and in the next video, I'll talk a little bit more about the social forces that caused The Second Great Awakening and the consequences of its proliferation in early 19th century America.."
Social Studies,"But when we think as historians, it's not enough just to say, okay, there was an explosion of religion in American culture in the early 19th century. Instead we want to say what conditions in American life led to this explosion? Why did this major cultural change happen? So let's explore some of what was going on in the early 19th century that led people to reinterpret religion."
Social Studies,"As I described in the last video, the Second Great Awakening is part of this larger web of cultural, social, and political movements and economic movements that are going on in this time period. Historians have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on in American life that led to this sudden reemergence of religious devotion. So let's explore more on this side of our web and I have two maps for us to explore here. One is a map of the Erie Canal."
Social Studies,"And this canal, which allowed goods and crops and all sorts of things to be transported from western New York down to the Port of New York City, and this is kind of the area that we're looking at here. Let's see if I can make it a little more obvious. So this is a blow-up of that little region right there. This canal was completed in 1825."
Social Studies,"And I tell you this not just because canals are awesome, although they are, but because the Erie Canal is a really important moment in what's called the Market Revolution. Now, I'll go more into the Market Revolution in another video, but what's important about the Market Revolution is that it's this time when how Americans did business and their social interactions with people that they did business with really changed a lot. So there are a couple important aspects of the Market Revolution."
Social Studies,"One of these is a revolution in transportation, which includes the invention and slow expansion of railroads, canals, like the Erie Canal, steamships. And steamships let you do things like go the wrong way up the Mississippi River and look at all the farmland that leads to this Port of New Orleans here. So these new forms of transportation make it much easier for farmers and people who produce goods to get those goods to distant markets."
Social Studies,"So if you're a farmer here in Buffalo, now, instead of only being able to sell your apples, say, to people who live within a certain radius before your apples go bad, you can just put them on a nice little barge on the Erie Canal and send them down to New York City within a number of days. Likewise, if you're farming wheat in Missouri, you don't have to sell to just people in here. You can now sell to people all the way down in New Orleans."
Social Studies,"And that means you can also even sell to people internationally, right? These are the big ports, New York City, Philadelphia, Charleston. So as a producer of goods, you are not just part of a small local market. You're now part of an international market. And it also means you're gonna need ways of communicating with people who are far away, like the telegraph, for example."
Social Studies,"But one more anxious aspect of this new kind of market-based system is that you're no longer doing business quite so much with people that you know. So you might correspond only by letter or by telegram to the main buyer for your crops. And likewise, someone who's buying those crops might only be able to correspond distantly with the person who's producing them. So this personal relationship between people who are exchanging goods and services starts to erode and that's very anxious for a lot of people."
Social Studies,"How do you know that the person on the other end of your transaction isn't going to con you in some way? You see this a lot in this time period. The United States also starts to urbanize and there's lots of writing about how people worry that the people that they're passing on the street might be con men or otherwise out to get them. You know, in many ways, up until this time, the United States had something of a barter economy."
Social Studies,"If you look at people's personal ledgers, you know, everybody kept a very detailed log of what they had given to whom and who they owed what. In an average day, somebody might give you a carton of eggs on credit and you might build a log cabin for somebody on credit because there was this mutual community system of giving and owing that everyone had a notion could be enforced, at least through social mores."
Social Studies,"Now, as people begin dealing distantly, those social mores don't exist and it makes people really nervous. The other aspect of this Market Revolution that I think is pretty important is, in this time period, more and more people start working for wages as opposed to being subsistence farmers. So, you know, in the early Colonial period, most people worked, it's kind of a family unit. Various tasks might be assigned to various family members, but one way or another, everybody worked in the home."
Social Studies,"Now, as factories start to spring up as part of the Market Revolution, people are going to work for wages and typically involves a man leaving the home and the woman remaining in it. So we get what was known as the cult of domesticity, where women are the guardians of the home and the moral guardians of their families and men go out into the cruel world and toil away for their daily bread. So why does that matter? Well, one reason that it matters is because people are now no longer their own bosses."
Social Studies,"Somebody else is the boss of that person. And they only have so much motivation to get something done, right? If your whole family's subsistence depends on you making sure that you get this crop in on time, you're gonna make sure it happens. But if you're just being paid by the hour to run a spindle at a textile factory, how much money your boss makes off your labor isn't really your concern. And so there's a lot of anxiety around making what had been basically a farming nation into an industrial nation."
Social Studies,"How does one behave as a worker in a factory and how does one, as a factory owner, make sure that you have a sober, intelligent, hard-working, but not too rowdy workforce? So both of these innovations, the relationship between buyers and sellers in distant markets, and the relationship between factory owners and factory workers create anxiety about how you're going to know people are good, how you're going to know that people are holding up their end in society."
Social Studies,"And one way to promote that is through religion, which tells you not to be a sinner, which tells you to do a good job, which tells you to be a productive member of society and work for the common good, and promote your moral compass. Now, that's just one explanation for why the Second Great Awakening took off in this time period. And you can tell, it's kind of a grim one, right, in terms of promoting religion basically to keep people in line."
Social Studies,"But that's not the only possible explanation for why the Second Great Awakening may have happened. There are also a bunch of social changes in this time period that could be serious contributors to this explosion of religion. Now, one of these was just westward expansion in general. So as the United States moved west, the rate of western expansion, really, actually increased in this time period."
Social Studies,"So about 1790, the center of American population was about here, right? So let's think about both north and south, east and west, where people lived. If you kind of totaled them all up and put a dot right in the middle of where everybody lived, it would just be right here kind of on the Eastern Seaboard, as everyone's pretty close to the coast. By 1840, the center of population was way over here."
Social Studies,"So just think, if this is all the people who had to live there to be on either side of that line, think of how many people have to be on either side of this line for the population to have its center right there. So people have really spread out in this time period."
Social Studies,"Where before, there was kind of this east coast elite where all the money was, now the Market Revolution has meant that people who live along these byways, live along rivers and canals and railroads, those towns are gonna start having people in them with some money. And so the middle class expands and the amount of people who have the vote expands. So it's really a time of expanding democracy in general, both in terms of wealth and in terms of political power."
Social Studies,"And so you can see why a religion like that promoted in the Second Great Awakening, the Baptists, the Methodists, that said anyone can have a relationship with God, would become more popular as more and more people started to kind of take their own fates in their own hands, right? This is the time of the rugged individual, a very popular idea that one, you know, pulled oneself by the bootstraps and that's the pioneering spirit."
Social Studies,"So very characteristic American values that went into making a type of religion with more individuality, with more possibilities for more people much more popular in this time period. And there's one case of this that I think is really interesting and it's in western New York. So in western New York, there's the town of Rochester. And Rochester is really like a boomtown. It's along the Erie Canal, as we saw in the previous map."
Social Studies,"And Rochester becomes, kind of, almost the epicenter of new religious movements in this time period. So within this radius of Rochester, people called this the burned-over district because there were so many religious revivals in this time period, that it was like the whole district was burned over with hellfire, these preachers coming past and talking about the apocalypse."
Social Studies,"And so we'll get to talking more about some of the religious movements that come out of this, but within just a couple of miles of Rochester, the Oneida Community was born. Spiritualism, which was the religion that's kind of based around seances was born. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, often called the Mormons, their religion was born outside Rochester. Even the Shakers were founded in upstate New York, near Albany."
Social Studies,"So I think it's noteworthy that, as new communities, new people are gaining prominence through the Market Revolution, along with them comes a new religious movement. And we'll talk more about what the impact of this new religious movement was on American society in the next video.."
Social Studies,"So why do we care so much that there was this period of religious revival? What did it lead to in American life? There are two major things that were directly related to The Second Great Awakening in this early 19th century. New religious movements in the United States, some of which are still with us today and even more importantly for the time period, major reform movements, including the Movement for Abolition, the end of slavery, which is going to lead to the outbreak of The Civil War."
Social Studies,"So let's look a little bit closer at these two things. So as we've talked about, The Second Great Awakening promoted both the idea that one should try to create heaven on earth and also, a more democratic approach to religion in general, that it didn't matter who you were. If you were a man, a woman, white, black, enslaved, free, you were still entitled to a personal relationship with God and a chance at salvation."
Social Studies,"So one of the things this meant in this time period is that there's just a lot of religious experimentation. A lot of new American religions emerge at this time period, some of which are still with us today, some of which are not. This here is a representation of the Shakers, which were a religious community of, they embrace kind of simplicity. They separated the sexes. They practiced celibacy."
Social Studies,"Just as kind of trying to make their daily lives more pure and unfortunately, the celibacy part meant that they more or less died out by the 1940s, although there are a handful of Shakers who are still alive today and they were called the Shakers because they would have these kind of ecstatic religious experiences, which you can see are kind of similar to what happened in the camp meetings."
Social Studies,"So even though they didn't have sex, they would kind of get out their ecstasy in this process of these big circle dances, which people looked at and they said they seemed like they were shaking, so they were the Shakers."
Social Studies,"On the other side of the spectrum, there was the Oneida community, which was led by a man named John Humphrey Noyes and they preached the idea that one should have no earthly attachments basically and that meant also to a spouse, so they believed in what was called complex marriage or what we would really call free love. There was no such thing as an individual marriage, that women and men could have sex with whomever they pleased."
Social Studies,It's interesting that approaches to sex were very central to these religious movements.
Social Studies,"Probably the most important religious movement to come out of this time period was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, also known as the Mormons, who were founded by Joseph Smith in Rochester, New York and Smith had a vision that he was visited by an angel who presented him with gold plates and on these gold plates was a new Scripture called The Book of Mormon and Smith's followers really continued to be devoted to the religion, even though they faced a lot of persecution, particularly over their early practice of polygamy until they continued to move west under the leadership of a second man, Brigham Young, who took over after Smith was murdered by an angry crowd in Illinois who then led the Mormons to Utah where they continue to be a major religious group to this day."
Social Studies,"Oh, and one other interesting thing about this is the Oneida community. Although, it itself did not survive, one of the ways that they made money as a community was by making silverware and so Oneida Silverware is actually the descendant company of this really interesting communal experiment and they lasted, I believe, until 2006, so if you ever had Oneida Silverware, you were looking at an artifact of a 19th century religious movement."
Social Studies,So the last and probably the most important part of The Second Great Awakening that I wanna talk about is its influence on reform movements. So let me give myself a little bit more space to write here. There are several 19th century reform movements that are tied in to The Second Great Awakening.
Social Studies,"One of these would be The Temperance Movement, which hoped to reduce and or eliminate people's consumption of alcohol and you can kinda tie this back to the idea of heaven on earth, right? How can you have a stable family home, how can you have a godly society if everybody's drunk all the time? But I would say the most important reform movement associated with The Second Great Awakening was the Abolitionist Movement and remember that Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin, which was one of the greatest abolition or anti-slavery advertisements in the world, was the daughter of Lyman Beecher, one of the greatest preachers of The Second Great Awakening and so as people came to believe that everyone's life was equally valuable, they became more and more involved in the idea that slavery should not exist, that people who were enslaved had souls that were just as worthy of salvation as anyone who was already free and so they also saw this as one of the perversions of God's word and a perversion of the family, which they saw as the central unit of American democracy and Republicanism."
Social Studies,"So slavery should not exist. People who were really motivated by their faith in God and their faith in trying to create heaven on earth and a better society campaigned really strenuously for the end of slavery and ultimately, were successful. So this is a really complex topic, The Second Great Awakening."
Social Studies,"If we look back at our web again, we can see that this wave of religious revival was connected in all sorts of interesting ways to the economic and political changes of the time period and in its way, led to all sorts of different social changes, so I think it's a good example of how it's sometimes really hard to separate things that happened in the past into really neat boxes, right? That, oh, there was politics. There was religion. There was culture."
Social Studies,"There were economics, but in many ways, they're all bound together in a larger culture, within which everyday individuals navigated their lives and it's also good to show us that sometimes we don't exactly know why things happened in the past. We know that people got really interested in religion in this time period, but historians have differing ideas about why that might have been."
Social Studies,"Some say that it was a form of trying to control people as it was more and more important to have a dutiful workforce for a factory-based industrial society and some people say that maybe, it was just about demographic and political shifts in who had power, who had money, and who got to vote, but we do know that The Second Great Awakening and these ideas of trying to improve America, to improve the world, and to create heaven on earth led to all sorts of interesting things that are still with us today, including religious movements and the end of slavery.."
Social Studies,"And if you read the Declaration of Independence, you can hear the echoes of the Enlightenment: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, ""that all men are created equal, ""that they are endowed by their Creator ""with certain unalienable Rights, ""that among these are Life, Liberty, ""and the pursuit of Happiness."
Social Studies,"""That to secure these rights, ""Governments are instituted among Men, ""deriving their just powers from the consent ""of the governed..."" Jefferson looks at the evidence, the rational reasons for self-government. Now contrast that with a piece of writing from an American at the end of this period."
Social Studies,"Here's the last stanza from Edgar Allan Poe's poem The Raven, first published in 1845: ""...And the Raven, never flitting, ""still is sitting, still is sitting ""On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; ""And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's ""that is dreaming."
Social Studies,"""And the lamp-light o'er him streaming ""throws his shadow on the floor; ""And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating ""on the floor ""Shall be lifted, nevermore!"" What is going on here? Poe's talking about demons, and souls, and shadows. He's clearly not interested in reason or logic. Where Jefferson is cold, Poe is hot, emotional, imaginative, concentrating on the unseen world instead of the observable world that Jefferson prizes."
Social Studies,"This is because Poe, writing nearly 70 years later, was a product of the Romantic era. The Romantics rebelled against the Enlightenment ideas of pure reason and the scientific method, arguing instead that individual experience and emotion mattered more."
Social Studies,"So why do we care about this transition from the Enlightenment to the Romantic era in the history of the United States? Well, for one thing, because it helps us explain the Second Great Awakening, that period of intense religious devotion that emerged in the first half of the 19th century, and drove not only the creation of new religious moments in the United States, but also major reform movements."
Social Studies,"But we also care because it was during this time of transition that the first truly American art and literary movements emerged. Artists and writers stopped merely imitating European styles, although they were certainly still influenced by them, and began trying to capture a unique and different American culture. What they produced not only tells us a lot about their time period, but also created the foundation of what's considered American art or American literature today."
Social Studies,"One of the ways that Americans began to distinguish their culture was through architecture. In the late 1700s, American architecture started to move away from the Georgian style it had borrowed from Britain, the very symmetrical brick homes that were built during the era when kings named George were in power, and they started to draw more from the models of Roman and Greek architecture."
Social Studies,"Americans saw themselves as carrying on the traditions of the Roman Republic and Greek democracy, so they started employing some of the same architectural language. The Federal style started incorporating Roman elements into Georgian buildings, like Roman arches. Here you can see a bit of the transition from this Georgian building on Harvard's campus to this Federal building in Salem, Massachusetts. You go from square windows and doors to Roman arches. And this transition continued as the U.S."
Social Studies,"Capitol was built in Washington D.C. Starting in the 1820s, the Greek Revival style became prominent for monumental buildings, incorporating triangular pediments and Greek columns. Here you can see the original design of the U.S. Capitol building, which houses Congress. It has a central dome like the Pantheon in Rome, and then a full-on Greek temple pasted to its face. By adopting these elements, American architects sent the message that the United States wasn't just imitating British styles."
Social Studies,"Instead they were crafting an architectural form that was suitable for a republic. American art also began to diverge from its European forbears during the early 19th century. American-born painters in the Revolutionary era, like Gilbert Stuart, went to Europe to study and start their careers before heading back to the United States. Stuart's portraits of important American figures like George Washington followed the conventions of classical portraiture."
Social Studies,"It wasn't until the 1820s that American art began to come into its own with the Hudson River School. This was started by a group of painters working in Upstate New York who captured the majestic nature of the American landscape. They were influenced by the Romantic movement's emphasis on emotion and the sublime, which is the awe-inspiring, untamed aspect of nature that you find in mountains, and storms, and wilderness."
Social Studies,"The painters of the Hudson River School explored the relationship between the American environment and the march of settlement. Let's take a look at one Hudson River School painting, The Oxbow, which was painted in 1836 by Thomas Cole. The painting depicts a bend in the Connecticut River in Western Massachusetts. You can see that a thunderstorm is passing with dark clouds here on the left. And there's this twisted tree and downed limbs, which show how violent the storm was up on the mountain."
Social Studies,"It feels dangerous and unpredictable. That's the sublime right there. Then, on the right side, you have this river valley with farms and little plumes of smoke from houses. There's a boat on the river and some sheep grazing down here, and just barely visible in the foreground is a little self-portrait of Thomas Cole out with his easel. He's kind of saying, ""Yeah, that's right."
Social Studies,"""I'm out here dodging lightning to show you ""how the real deal looks."" So you can see in this painting that there's kind of a tension between the settled society on the right side and the wilderness on the left side. The vastness of the American West and the march of the first wave of industrialization gave painters a unique American subject for their art. Lastly, the first American writers and thinkers came on the scene during this era."
Social Studies,"Remember the Romantics glorified the experience of the individual and their emotions. The first American fiction writers to gain traction for an international audience described unique aspects of American society. Washington Irving, who we remember today for the Headless Horseman in ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" another romantic ghost story like Poe's The Raven, achieved renown by telling folk tales about the lingering Dutch culture in Upstate New York."
Social Studies,"James Fenimore Cooper's protagonist in his ""Leatherstocking Tales,"" Natty Bumppo, was a white frontiersman who grew up among the indigenous Delaware People. His nickname was Hawkeye, and yes, the Marvel character is named after him, which gives you a sense of how these first American characters have continued to live on in our contemporary culture. In New England, particularly Boston and the surrounding areas, American intellectuals embraced Romanticism in the philosophy of Transcendentalism."
Social Studies,"The Transcendentalists were a group of writers, poets, and philosophers who believed that truth transcended the observable world of the Enlightenment, and that spiritual meaning could be found in nature. Henry David Thoreau is probably the most famous Transcendentalist. He wrote a book about his two years living simply in a cabin he built on the edge of Walden Pond, on fellow Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson's property. The Transcendentalists also emphasized the individual and freedom of thought."
Social Studies,"Emerson, who's generally considered the founder of the Transcendentalist movement, wrote essays encouraging Americans to think for themselves, not just go along with the crowd. Some of the most influential Transcendentalists were women, like Margaret Fuller, who wrote about the state of women in the 19th century and edited the Transcendentalist magazine The Dial."
Social Studies,"Poet Emily Dickinson has sometimes been classed among the Transcendentalists, as has Louisa May Alcott, the author of ""Little Women."" The freedom of thought that the Transcendentalists espoused also led them to become some of the strongest opponents of the institution of slavery. Thoreau refused to pay his taxes in protest of the Mexican American War, which he and many Northerners saw as an unjust land-grab to extend southern territory and spread slavery west."
Social Studies,"He wrote an essay about his experience called ""Resistance to Civil Government,"" sometimes shortened to ""Civil Disobedience,"" which encouraged individuals not to obey unjust laws. His ideas would go on to influence Mahatma Gandhi and later Martin Luther King, Junior.."
Social Studies,"It started as kind of this idea that people should just drink a little bit less, they should drink less whiskey, less rum, less hard alcohol. And then, slowly, it started to take on this kind of prohibitory character. So, again, it was the idea that we just needed to temper our alcohol consumption. And so, how did the temperance movement take root? The temperance movement kinda has three main causes that I like to think about."
Social Studies,"So, the three main causes were the Second Great Awakening, the Industrial Revolution, and growing nativism and, frankly, racism that started as new immigrants were coming to America in the early-1800s. So, this was all kinda happening right around here, and so I'll talk a little bit more about each of these causes for the temperance movement and how it began. So, I'll start by talking about the Second Great Awakening."
Social Studies,"So, the Second Great Awakening was this time period in the early-1800s that focused a lot of social reforms around capturing moral good or Christian ideals so Christian ideals, here's the little cross, within our social institutions. So, this happened in education, in prisons, in the first women's rights movement. And so, this was all going on in the 1800s and it was about this idea that we needed to be good and moral people, and we needed our social institutions to reflect that."
Social Studies,"So, temperance can be seen as a part of the Second Great Awakening. And so, down here, you can kind of see the Second Great Awakening image here. This is the idea that the family was also intimately affected by people being too drunk. Here's the father and he's really drunk and things are kind of going to mayhem. People were just too drunk, and this was tearing apart lots of different institutions, including the family, including education, including the workplace."
Social Studies,"And so, that's a good transition to talking about the Industrial Revolution. So, the Industrial Revolution was also going on at this time period and people could no longer be drunk on the job, right? So, people used to be artisans. They used to just kind of sit in their home, make their shoes or sew something by hand, and they could be drunk while doing that."
Social Studies,"But now, if you're kind of in a factory setting, people were getting their fingers cut off by these new machines that were promoted in the Industrial Revolution because they were drunk while trying to operate the machinery. So, with this new industry, workers could no longer be drunk on the job. And so, the final cause is this nativism that people were seeing with new Catholic immigrants. So, there were Catholic immigrants coming into the country."
Social Studies,"And lots of Protestants were very anti-Catholic and anti-immigration. They decided that the Catholics were drunks. They did drink a lot, but it was definitely this kind of racist sentiment that was percolating within the Protestant community, and this kind of aligned itself with the Whig Party. So, the Whigs became more Protestant; they were really big temperance people. And the Catholics more aligned themselves with the Democrats."
Social Studies,"The sentiment towards these immigrant populations had this kind of political effect. So, at this time, temperance was starting to become more of a political movement and different social groups were taking this more seriously. There were some state-level organizations. It was just becoming more of a social phenomenon. In 1825, right over here, this really famous preacher, Lyman Beecher, did his six sermons on the sins of alcohol."
Social Studies,"And so, these sermons in 1825 solidified this idea in the American mind that it was anti-Christian to be a huge drinker, and this idea really took root. This is becoming kind of this larger social phenomenon and there start to be not just more state-level or community-level societies against drinking, you see the first ever national organization. So, the first national temperance society was in 1826, down here, with the American Temperance Society, so the ATS."
Social Studies,And I'll talk more about the ATS and the kind of nationalization of the temperance movement in the next video..
Social Studies,"So, in the last video, I mentioned that the American Temperance Society was founded in 1826, so that's 1826. But the American Temperance Society really was this group of upper-class Northern white dudes saying, ""Oh, well, we should probably make sure ""that people don't drink as much."" But this idea didn't take off until the rise of teetotalism. So, teetotalism is very different than temperance. Teetotalism."
Social Studies,"And so, teetotalism is the idea that people should not temper their alcohol consumption, that they should drink no alcohol. So, the origin of this word is debated among historians and there's kinda two funny stories. One is the idea that when you would sign a pledge, so let's say I was going to pledge that I would drink no alcohol and join the American Temperance Society, right here, I would have to sign my name like that and write my name, Becca."
Social Studies,"Or the other idea is that there was this temperance activist and he was trying to convince people to stop drinking alcohol. And he said, ""You don't have to stop drinking hard alcohol, ""you have to-to-to-to totally abstain,"" and that's where teetotalism came from, his stutter. Just kind of a fun little factoid about teetotalism. But this idea of signing a pledge to drink no alcohol was really popular among these different societies that started popping up."
Social Studies,"So, the American Temperance Society was not quite as effective. But the Washingtonian Temperance Society started in the 1840s, in 1840, actually, the Washington Temperance Society. And the Washington Temperance Society was different than the American Temperance Society because it kind of looked a little bit more like the 19th century version of Alcoholics Anonymous. People would come together and talk about their problem."
Social Studies,"There wasn't really a treatment aspect, it wasn't super effective in stopping people from drinking alcohol because a pledge, people realized, wasn't actually going to stop alcoholics from drinking. However, the Washingtonian Temperance Society was more this group of middle class men and they would all come together and try and curb their consumption. So, during this time, there were also lots of prohibitory laws being passed by the states."
Social Studies,"So, different states at different times during the early-1800s started to try and curb consumption by enacting laws. They realized that the pledges, you know, me signing my name like this, didn't actually help that much, and so they needed to do something legally. The first temperance law was passed by Maine in 1838, Maine, and this law just outlawed the sale of hard liquor. But slowly, states across the country started banning alcohol consumption altogether."
Social Studies,"So, this was kinda happening all throughout here and 12-15 states had some sort of regulatory law on alcohol. So, over this time period, from the 1830s to the 1860s, Americans were not just taking pledges like they were up here with the American Temperance Society and the Washingtonian Temperance Society, but they were actually enacting laws. Temperance went really mainstream."
Social Studies,"It wasn't just this idea that you were going to sign a pledge to stop drinking hard alcohol, there were gonna be laws that would bind you to drink no alcohol. So, on top of this legal transition, there was also a big social and media campaign about the terrors and evils of alcohol. So, right over here is The Drunkard's Progress. So, this is really famous lithograph created by Nathaniel Currier. This was in 1846, so Drunkard's Progress, right over here."
Social Studies,"And The Drunkard's Progress, as you can see, shows the kind of cyclic nature of the alcoholic. First, he's just drinking at home, then he's drinking with friends. And then, oh, what is going on there? He is not going to be going to the factory today for work. So, the drunk started not as a drunk but as your average guy just having a drink here or there. Then you would see them go through each of these steps, you see Step 2, Step 3, Step 4."
Social Studies,"Over here, Step 5 seems like he's just hanging out with his buddies, having a good time, but then it really slowly deteriorated into something that Americans didn't want. So then, in 1853, I guess that's kind of in here, 1853, this media campaign just took off with Ten Nights in a Bar-Room, so Ten Nights in a Bar-Room. Here it is, Ten Nights in a Bar-Room. This is one of the pictures in the book. This really had just huge mainstream reach; almost everyone read it."
Social Studies,"And then they started putting on plays of it, depicting just how drunk people got and how terrible that was for everyone involved. Ten Night in a Bar-Room had this really national reach and it was similar to that of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Uncle Tom's Cabin in the abolition movement. So, this was this rhetoric that made the temperance movement take off."
Social Studies,"So, you're probably wondering, then what? What happened to temperance? Why did prohibition not happen until 1920? And so, this has a lot to do with the abolition movement. So, the abolition movement was taking off right around here, abolition. And the abolition movement was the idea that slavery had to be ended right now, today. Abolition was the focus of the American people come the mid-1800s, and this really put temperance on hold."
Social Studies,"And so, temperance would come back after the Civil War and after slavery was abolished. So, you can learn more about postbellum temperance, postbellum, that means after the Civil War, postbellum temperance and prohibition in the Khan Academy article titled Prohibition. You can check that out and learn a little bit more about how this whole crazy story ended.."
Social Studies,"Scott actually followed the same route that Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes took more than 300 years earlier. Winfield Scott's campaign to Mexico City was just one of three fronts in the two-year-long, continent-spanning effort of the United States to take Mexican territory by force. The other two fronts were in California and New Mexico."
Social Studies,"After the two nations made peace by signing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in mid 1848, the United States gained over a million square miles of new territory, a landmass larger than the Louisiana Purchase. For Mexico, this war was a catastrophic defeat, which resulted in the loss of about 1/3 of its total area."
Social Studies,"The Mexican-American War doesn't really loom large in American memory, compared to the Revolutionary War or the Civil War, but it was a transformative event in the history of the United States and North America. On the scale of national politics, the war led to political realignment, and eventually, the Civil War. But on a human scale, it led to transformations in the lives of people who lived in the West who went to bed one day in Mexico and woke up the next day in the United States."
Social Studies,"National boundaries shifted under their feet. For those people, the outcome of the war meant new laws, customs, new friends and enemies, and even the loss of rights and privileges. So let's dive a little deeper into the causes and effects of the Mexican-American War. The war began in April of 1846. A Mexican cavalry brigade attacked US forces who were under the command of General Zachary Taylor across the Rio Grande River from the town of Matamoros, Mexico. After this attack, President James K."
Social Studies,"Polk sent a war message to Congress. He fumed that the Mexican troops had invaded our territory and shed American blood on American soil. Now back up a minute. You may be wondering, as many keen observers did at the time, what exactly were US forces doing there near Rio Grande River in the first place? And the answer to that reveals the two major causes of the war, Texas annexation and Manifest Destiny. Let's start by talking about Texas annexation."
Social Studies,"American settlers, many of whom were slave owners, had been moving to Texas since the 1820s, when the region was still controlled by Spain. After Mexican independence, the country outlawed slavery. But the American settlers resisted the Mexican government's authority. In 1836, they rebelled and won independence for Texas. They requested the United States annex the new nation shortly thereafter, but adding another slave state to the Union was politically dangerous for the administration at that time."
Social Studies,"So Texas remained an independent nation until 1845. In 1845, Democratic president James K. Polk took office. Now Polk was an ardent expansionist. He was a believer in Manifest Destiny, this idea that God wanted the United States to expand across the North American continent. Polk wanted to annex Texas, which his administration undertook immediately. He also desperately wanted California, which was a hub of commerce on the Pacific Ocean. This is actually before gold was discovered there."
Social Studies,So Polk sent a representative to the Mexican government offering to buy California. But Mexico said California was not for sale. Now Polk was determined to get this territory with blood or money. So he came up with an alternate plan. The border between Mexico and Texas was under dispute. So Polk directed General Zachary Taylor to go down into this disputed territory and provoke hostilities. And that's exactly what happened when the Mexican cavalry attacked Taylor's forces.
Social Studies,"As far as Mexico was concerned, Taylor's troops were invading their country, and they had no choice but to defend it. Despite Polk's war message saying that American blood had been shed on American soil, many US politicians were also skeptical about who started the war and where. A young Whig congressman from Illinois named Abraham Lincoln demanded that Polk show him the exact spot where American blood had been shed."
Social Studies,"The war that ensued was longer, costlier, and deadlier than the US government had estimated, which is often the case with wars. At its conclusion, Polk had achieved his vision for Manifest Destiny. In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war, the United States agreed to pay Mexico $15 million, and in exchange, Mexico ceded Texas, California, and most of the modern-day Southwest to the United States."
Social Studies,"So what were the effects of this war? Well, the addition of this Mexican cession territory had far-reaching consequences for both the United States and the residents of the West. The existing resident of the territory, including Mexicans, Native Americans, and the descendants of Spanish colonists, found that life under the rule of the United States could be very different than under the rule of Mexico."
Social Studies,"Where Mexican law had abolished slavery and proscribed equality under the law for people regardless of color, the Texas constitution permitted slavery and denied civil rights to non-white residents. For other residents of the territory, life didn't change much at all. Huge swathes of the West were actually controlled by Native American nations, like the Comanche Empire, which didn't care whether the distant government who claimed their territory on paper was located in Mexico City or in Washington DC."
Social Studies,"For the United States government, the addition of this new territory was political kryptonite. Both Northerners and Southerners were convinced that the opposite region was conspiring to limit their economic opportunities in the West. During the war, Congressman David Wilmot of Pennsylvania introduced a resolution in the House that would prohibit slavery in any territory gained from the conflict."
Social Studies,"The reaction to the Wilmot Priviso showed just how big the sectional divide in the country was becoming, since party lines broke down entirely. Northerners, Whig, and Democrat alike voted for the Wilmot Proviso, and Southerners, Whig, and Democrat alike voted against it. Ultimately, the proviso passed in the House was defeated in the Senate."
Social Studies,"And then gold was discovered in California, just before the end of the war, sending hordes of prospectors West and making statehood for California an urgent issue that would soon upset the balance of power between free and slave states in Congress. In other words, we can draw a direct line from the Mexican War to the breakdown of the second party system, which was replaced by a solidly Southern Democratic party and a new Northern Republican party, and from there to the Civil War.."
Social Studies,"He said Uncle Tom's Cabin actually started the Civil War. So how does a book start a war? -  I think that's a really good question, Kim, and these next two videos are gonna help us understand a little bit more why Lincoln said that. How does a little book start a war? So this book was written by Harriet Beecher Stowe, here she is, Stowe, and Harriet Beecher Stowe was born in Litchfield, Connecticut to this kind of great abolitionist family."
Social Studies,"So what's abolitionism, Kim? -  Well abolitionism was the belief in mostly in the early 19th century that slavery should be ended immediately. So there were varieties of beliefs about the institution of slavery in early America. Some people obviously were very pro-slavery believe that it was a natural institution sanctioned by the Bible."
Social Studies,"Some people, like Abraham Lincoln, at least early in his political career, just wanted slavery to stay where it was, and those were what we would call free-soilers, or anti-slavery advocates. They said, ""Alright, we can't get rid of slavery ""in the South. ""It's too entrenched there as an institution, ""but we can make sure that it does not spread ""to any of the Western territories ""that we might settle in the future."" But abolitionists were these strongest opponents of slavery."
Social Studies,"They said that slavery should be ended today everywhere in the United States and the world, and that it is an immoral, un-Christian institution. So these Western territories were a really big part of the increasing tension over the institution of slavery in the 1850s."
Social Studies,"So in 1848, the United States won the Mexican-American War and they got a whole bunch of new territory that had once been Mexico, and these will become the states of Texas, and Oklahoma, and many of the sort of Midwestern states we have today, but this now threatened the balance of power between those slave-holding states in US Congress and those that were free states, so now everyone is wondering is slavery going to spread to the West? Should slavery spread to the West? -  And this kind of anxiety about the Western expansion of slavery was more tense and became more sectionally divided after the Compromise of 1850."
Social Studies,"So the Compromise of 1850 happened right here in 1850, (laughter) and the Compromise of 1850, I like to think of it kind of like a band-aid over this sectional tension, so I'll draw you guys a little band-aid. -  This is like a gaping wound, right, and the Compromise of 1850 is just like this tiny, little band-aid that's kind of holding this dam together to mix my metaphors."
Social Studies,"-  The Compromise of 1850 actually admitted California as a free state, which was a really big win for the North, obviously. -  Right, lots of gold. -  But it also had a really strong Fugitive Slave Act, so this was a really kind of critical part of the Compromise of 1850, and this was a big win for the South."
Social Studies,"So why was it a big win? -  Well the Fugitive Slave Act said that if a marshal was in your town requesting your help in rounding up an escaped slave, you had to help that marshal or face charges yourself. So this meant that any time that someone who was enslaved in the South made a run for the North, a run for Canada as many of the enslaved people did, anyone in the North might be drafted to help return that person to the South."
Social Studies,"-  And if they didn't, they were oftentimes fined, and this really made all Northerners participatory in slavery, even if they weren't slaveholders themselves or living on a plantation in the South, Northerners were participating in the way that slavery was held together by disallowing runaway slaves from continuing their lives in free territories."
Social Studies,"-  So you could imagine how this might really galvanize a Northern audience into action about slavery because before, you might think, ""Well, I don't like slavery, ""but what does it have to do with me, right? ""I'm just a grain miller living in Pennsylvania. ""None of my business."
Social Studies,"""I don't like it, but I can't do anything about it, ""and it's not my fault."" Now all of a sudden, if an escaped slave comes past your house and a marshal follows him or her, now you've got to be a person to round that person up, and so that means you have to participate in slavery directly, and so you might find yourself thinking, ""You know what, I refuse to do that, ""and that means that I really do hate slavery."" -  And this was definitely the sentiment that Stowe and her family had on the Underground Railroad."
Social Studies,"So Stowe lived on a stop in the Underground Railroad, and that was this passageway for Southern slaves to get to the North, and Stowe and her husband actually helped a lot of runaway slaves."
Social Studies,"-  So the Underground Railroad wasn't like a literal railroad, right? I mean that would be pretty sweet if there were a railroad that went under the ground all the way up to Canada, but it was more like a sort of an informal network of people who might help escaped slaves, direct them to food and shelter, and just kind of send them along to the next waypost on their trip, either to the North or to Canada."
Social Studies,"-  And so when the Fugitive Slave Act was passed with the Compromise of 1850, the band-aid, this really upset Harriet Beecher Stowe and really was one of the main catalysts for her writing this book."
Social Studies,"She also witnessed a slave auction, and this Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote about as just this terrible kind of scene of a family being just torn apart, and this was a really common practice within slavery, that the unit of the family was not respected as slaveholders wanted to sell their slaves to different plantations throughout the South, and the slave auction really became the basis for the plot of Uncle Tom's Cabin. -  Slave auctions were absolutely terrible."
Social Studies,"In fact, not long before the Civil War, the main slave auction site in Washington, D.C. was just around the corner from the White House, so imagine walking down the thoroughfare of this great democracy, seeing the president's house, the seat of government, and then turning a corner and seeing people being sold off the block."
Social Studies,"You know Abraham Lincoln saw a slave auction in New Orleans and he said it was one of the things that most influenced him to hate slavery, just witnessing these families being torn apart. And imagine either watching a mother being sold away from her infant children, or being that mother wondering what it would be like if you're ever going to see them again."
Social Studies,"-  I think that's a really important point just to show that this was something that was happening all around the United States and this was just abolitionist fervor was bubbling up, and then in 1852, when this book was published, it really set into motion this new wave of political rhetoric, and other novels, and just a lot of talk about these fundamental contradictions between Christianity and human bondage. -  And we'll get to that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"So, remind me again of what Uncle Tom's Cabin was actually about. - [Becca] So Uncle Tom's Cabin was about the horrors of slavery in the deep south and also appealed to a lot of American's Christian values and tried to point out these fundamental contradictions between Christian faith and slavery. - [Kim] So, it was published in 1852. How did people receive this book? - [Becca] So there was a lot of mixed reactions. But, it was the most read book of the 19th century, so there were a lot of reactions."
Social Studies,"(laughing) In the north, mostly, people were reading this all the time, no matter if you were an intellectual or just kind of a 17 year old picking up a book off a shelf, you were going to read Uncle Tom's Cabin. And a lot of the people that actually read the book were young men that would later fight in the Civil War. - [Kim] How interesting. Okay, so, like this would be our book club book of the month except everybody was, this was like the Oprah's book club choice of 1852. - [Becca] Exactly."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Everybody was reading it. - [Becca] Yeah, there's really almost nothing like it. Not even Harry Potter. But it did have the same international scope that Harry Potter does today. - [Kim] So, it was popular in the northern United States, and elsewhere in the world. So, where else was it popular? - [Becca] Mostly in Europe. But it was translated into over 60 languages. - [Kim] Wow. - [Becca] And, this also kind of put the spotlight on American slavery. So, there was all this international attention."
Social Studies,"What is going on in America, and what's going to happen? - [Kim] That's so interesting. It reminds me of The King and I. If you've seen that she, the woman goes to Siam, and shows people the book Uncle Tom's Cabin and they put on a version of a play based on Uncle Tom's Cabin in what would be Thailand. - [Becca] So yeah, so this makes it this kind of international spectacle. The fate of slavery had to be somehow figured out, and everyone was watching. - [Kim] That's so interesting."
Social Studies,"So, I'm imagining that white southerners were not big fans of this book. - [Becca] So, white southerners were definitely not a fan of Uncle Tom's Cabin. And in response, there was this movement of these things called anti-Tom novels. Here's an anti-Tom novel right next to us, right over here, Aunt Phillis's Cabin. (Kim laughing) - [Kim] Creative name. - [Becca] Aunt Phillis' Cabin, yes (laughing), very creative name."
Social Studies,"These anti-Tom novels aimed to point out that maybe Harriet Beecher Stowe didn't know what she was actually talking about. They also accused Harriet Beecher Stowe of not actually even living in the deep south, so she didn't even know what slavery was like. They wanted to paint southern slave society in this really positive light. They wanted to show all the ways that it actually maintains social order, and promoted economic welfare, so this was kind of this response from the south, also in novel form."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, it's this big kind of cultural battle over the interpretation of slavery. You have people on one hand saying slavery is destructive to families, slavery is incompatible with Christianity. And then, responses from the white south, saying, oh no, actually slavery is great, it helps everybody. - [Becca] Right, so there was this kind of battle within the literary community about the peculiar institution of slavery. Which one was it? - [Kim] So what if, I'm illiterate, right."
Social Studies,"I mean, not everybody in 19th century America was a New England intellectual who was reading Christian novels. How would I have heard about Uncle Tom's Cabin? - [Becca] That's a really good point, Kim. So, Tom Shows were depictions of Uncle Tom's Cabin in theaters around the world. And so, they were often times put on by abolitionist people trying to point out the issues with slavery today and end slavery immediately."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, this is before there's copyright law, right, so you can just put on a show of anybody's novel if you feel like it. - [Becca] Exactly, but often times, they really misconstrued the novel. And actually, now are remembered as contributing to the problem of racism in America. - [Kim] Racial stereotypes, too, I would imagine, because we still have this phrase Uncle Tom kind of to mean an African-American who is a martyr to the status quo as opposed to someone who might fight against racism."
Social Studies,"It seems like they might have borrowed a lot of these stereotypes from minstrel shows which were also very popular in this time period. - [Becca] And some of the characters within these minstrel shows turned into the character that was remembered as Jim Crow, which became the dominating racial order after the Civil War."
Social Studies,"So, in the Civil Rights era in the mid-1950's, lots of activists actually wanted to completely reject the progress that Uncle Tom's Cabin and these Tom Shows had made because they actually reduced African Americans to this terrible stereotype. And so, later on, this kind of idea that someone was an Uncle Tom became a racial slur, really, and they then rejected Uncle Tom's Cabin as being a tool towards racial equality and more saw it as a part of the problem."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, I think, the most important thing about Uncle Tom's Cabin is that it's this catalyst of really intense emotions about slavery which in the 1850's will lead eventually to the Civil War. And, following the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin, you'll see more and more violence on both sides of this issue. For example, John Brown, this famous abolitionist actually goes out to Kansas and murders people."
Social Studies,"- [Becca] And I think that Lincoln was very astute in pointing out that Uncle Tom's Cabin really catalyzed a lot of this violence. And he even met with Harriet Beecher Stowe, so she earned herself a little meeting with Abraham Lincoln. (Kim laughing) - [Kim] And he said, ""So you're the little lady that started this great war."" I'm trying to think of another book that has started a war. - [Becca] I think we would probably remember that."
Social Studies,"But I do think Lincoln was really astute in pointing out just how impactful this cultural phenomenon, this Tom-mania was on the question of slavery and on the fate of the American people. And really, it just begged the question in a new way, in this kind of public setting. I mean, I just think that the book itself, the way that the book could just travel all around the United States and so many different kinds of people were able to read it and get their hands on it."
Social Studies,"This really was just this movement of people just thinking a lot about slavery, reading a lot about slavery. - [Kim] Yeah, well, I think after Uncle Tom's Cabin, I don't think there was a way to not have an opinion on the slavery issue. Either you were for it, or you were against it. And that divisiveness would lead to the Civil War. - [Becca] And again, there's this international focus."
Social Studies,"There's a deeper, sectional divide between the north and the south, and there was this kind of sorting over the slavery question that Uncle Tom's Cabin really promoted.."
Social Studies,"She was really deeply effected by the Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act, and also by slave auctions. So this video will get a little bit more into the heart of the plot of the novel which does have to do with the family being torn apart. -  So what was Uncle Tom's Cabin actually about? Uncle Tom's Cabin was set on a plantation in Kentucky and it starts out with this kind of group of slaves that are about to be sold to other plantation owners. So Eliza and her son actually run away."
Social Studies,"They run up North, so Eliza goes up North and Uncle Toms is sold down the river. -  So, Eliza is trying to make sure that she and her son are not separated by being sold. So she decides that she is going to escape and take her son with her up to Canada. But Uncle Tom, he's not actually related, he is sold in the opposite direction. He's getting farther away from freedom by heading down the Mississippi."
Social Studies,"When you think about the geography of slavery it's a much more urban environment than some of the more coastal areas. So you might be in Charleston, or you might even be in Baltimore as an enslaved person. You might have a pretty high degree of freedom and also a possibility of escape either by crossing the border or by boat. When you're sold into the deep South area you are deep in plantation country and there might not be another soul that you could rely on to help you escape for 100, 200 miles."
Social Studies,"-  And I think this is really something that Harriet Beecher Stowe wants to help point out in the book, that there was this sense of doom for Uncle Tom. However, his Christian faith was the only thing that really kept him going. He bonded with this young white woman that he met, Eva, just about their Christian faith. And really, reading his Bible was the thing that got him up in the morning."
Social Studies,"So where were those feelings about religion coming from? -  You can definitely see that Harriet Beecher Stowe is influenced by her own family's faith which is influenced by the Second Great Awakening. The Second Great Awakening was this flowering of religious belief in the 1830s and 1840s. It was kind of a reaction against the Era of Enlightenment which was what had inspired the founders of the United States to think of a more humanist world, a more rational, scientific world."
Social Studies,"People start going to camp meetings, they have religious revivals. They experience religious conversions. And in this time period there's a shift in thinking about God in the United States. If you think back to the puritans they have this incredibly punitive sort of Old Testament destroyer God, right? One of the most famous early sermons in the United States is sinners in the hands of an angry God, that at any moment God might release you into the flames."
Social Studies,"Well there's a new emphasis on Christ-like love in the early 1830s, 1840s. New interpretation of God as being forgiving and gentle, family oriented, it's very Victorian. Where God was seen as this punisher who condemned most people to hell, in the Second Great Awakening there's a new emphasis on a forgiving, kind family-oriented Jesus who will save everyone. That's very incompatible with the ideas of slavery."
Social Studies,"-  Exactly, and I think that Uncle Tom's Cabin can really be considered a part of the Second Great Awakening because of the way that it points out these fundamental inconsistencies and contradictions between Christian faith and human bondage. How could a religion that says treat thy neighbor as thyself actually sanction slavery? -  So Uncle Tom is this martyr character, right? He is a devout believer in Christianity and the forgiveness of God right up until his very end."
Social Studies,"So how does Uncle Tom's Cabin actually end? -  Uncle Tom's Cabin ends with Uncle Tom is beaten by his overseers. He's sold through this chain of different slave families in the deep South and he ends up with just a terrible, terrible slave holder who requests his death, actually partially because he was reading all of this religious text.  And this slave owner was named Simon Legree."
Social Studies,"And this name, Simon Legree, has actually stuck with us in popular culture to mean a really evil, cruel, punitive master. -  The rest of the family actually meets back up. Eliza is reunited with a bunch of other people that were on the original plantation and they really think about Uncle Tom as this martyr, the hero's death. He's looked at as this sacrifice for the cause of freedom. -  Right, also Uncle Tom, he dies never having renounced his Christian faith."
Social Studies,"His example of martyrdom actually leads everyone who witnesses his death, including Simon Legree, to convert to Christianity and to vow never to hold slaves again."
Social Studies,-  But I think the ending of the book really points out this main theme within a lot of Second Great Awakening texts which was that if you just paid attention to how you are falling away from your Christian commitments then you could get back on track and maybe bring people together by utilizing Christian faith in a productive and public way.
Social Studies,"-  The book is published in 1852, then what happens? How do people receive this book? -  We'll talk about this Tom-mania that ensues in the next video.."
Social Studies,"San Francisco only had about a thousand residents, and California had only newly become a U.S. territory at the close of the Mexican-American War. And this is a photograph of San Francisco Harbor in 1850. The water is crowded with ships, and the land is crowded with houses. Less than two years later, San Francisco had 30-thousand residents, mainly young men who had come from all over the world, making the city perhaps the most culturally-diverse place on earth at that time period."
Social Studies,"What happened? The short answer is, gold. In January 1848, gold was discovered in California, near the Sierra Nevada mountains, right about here. San Francisco was the gateway to that gold. The nearest harbor where ships could land with prospective gold miners from the East Coast, Europe, South America, and Asia. Before the gold rush, the non-Indian population of the State of California was about 15-thousand people. By 1860, it was more than 350-thousand."
Social Studies,"And, in the same time period, the Native-American population decreased from 150-thousand to only 30 thousand. The gold rush, and its impact on California, is one very dramatic illustration of the causes and effects of westward migration in the years surrounding the Civil War."
Social Studies,"This drive to expand the United States West to the Pacific is often called manifest destiny, based on a phrase that was coined by New York journalist John O'Sullivan, who wrote in 1845 that westward expansion would be ""The fulfillment of our manifest destiny ""to overspread the continent allotted by Providence ""for the free development ""of our yearly multiplying millions."" The word 'manifest,' in this sense, means clear, or obvious, and 'Providence' is another word for God's help."
Social Studies,"So O'Sullivan was saying that God had provided the continent for the United States to expand, and it was obviously the destiny of the United States to do so. But despite the prevailing idea that the American West was an empty land full of limitless resources, there were in fact a lot of Native people already living in the West. And the arrival of people not only from the East Coast, but from all over the world in the second half of the 19th Century, would have enormous effects on both people and politics."
Social Studies,"So let's start by talking about what drew immigrants to the West in this era. First and foremost, they were drawn by economic opportunities available in the West. Before there were gold miners flooding San Francisco, most people who went to the West were farmers. As land became scarcer in the East, a trickle of farming families headed to the fertile Willamette Valley of Oregon, through the Oregon Trail."
Social Studies,"After the discovery of gold in California, and later in Montana, westward migration increased exponentially, but only a few miners actually struck it rich, mainly those who were already in the area before gold was discovered. Mining and farming weren't the only economic opportunities available in the west. Many people found work in the industries that served the miners, like hardware stores, boarding houses, and restaurants. There was also the railroad."
Social Studies,"Between 1860 and 1880, the miles of railroad track in the United States tripled. And, as the railroad expanded, so did opportunities for work on the railroad. The expansion of the railroad was one way that the Federal Government facilitated westward migration. In 1862, in the midst of the Civil War, Congress passed the Pacific Railway Act, which granted railroad companies more than 100-million acres in order to complete a transcontinental railroad, which they did in 1869."
Social Studies,"The transcontinental railroad reduced the time it took to get across the country from five months, so just six days, which made traveling, and transporting goods to and from the West, much easier. In 1862, Congress also passed the Homestead Act, which grated 160 acres of land, for free to anyone over the age of 21 who had never taken up arms against the U.S. Government, so no one who was affiliated with the Confederacy, as long as they made improvements to the land within five years."
Social Studies,"And this included women, immigrants, and African-Americans. The Homestead Act was the wartime extension of the ideas of the free soil movement: to populate Western lands with small, independent farmers, rather than slaveholders on giant plantations. More than 1.5 million people acquired land this way. The last reason that Americans headed West, that I'll talk about here, was cultural messaging of the time period."
Social Studies,"I mentioned earlier this notion of manifest destiny, that the United States had a divine mission to spread across North America. Closely related to that was a widespread belief among whites that American civilization was superior to other cultures, and that any barriers to U.S. expansion, like Native Americans and Mexican Americans who possessed the land onto which settlers flooded, were obstacles to progress and civilization."
Social Studies,"This painting, which was painted in 1872 by the artist John Gast, is called American Progress. In it, you can see an allegorical figure of America holding a schoolbook, and helping to lay telegraph wire. She brings with her symbols of American civilization: railroads, and covered wagons, and farmers with log cabins. And she drives away symbols of what the artist portrays as wilderness, or savagery: Native Americans, buffalo, even an angry bear down here."
Social Studies,"You can even see how the artist painted the right side of the painting with a bright, clear sky, and the left side with dark shadows and clouds so that this central figure of America seems to be driving out the darkness. I encourage you to pause the video and see how many symbols of civilization, and symbols of wilderness, you can identify in this painting. Now that we've discussed the causes of westward expansion, let's talk about some of its effects. A major one is an increase in sectional conflict."
Social Studies,"As new Western states joined the union, it inflamed tensions over the balance of power between free and slave states in Congress, which ultimately would lead to the Civil War. Another effect was an increase in racial conflict in the West. As people from all over the world came to the West, and competed for land and gold, there was a surge in racial violence. Before, and after the Civil War, as white settlers crowded onto the lands of Plains Indians, the U.S."
Social Studies,"Army sought to exterminate them, or confine them to reservations. In California, white miners sought to expel foreign miners, and Native Americans, from regions with gold. Vigilantes killed or expelled 80% of the Native population of the region in just over a decade. Also, in California, vigilante groups attacked Chinese communities, and even tried to destroy Chinatown in San Francisco in 1877. The State Government in California also imposed high taxes on foreign miners, especially the Chinese."
Social Studies,"These discriminatory laws would lay the groundwork for the first race-based immigration restriction in U.S. history, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. The enormous increase in westward expansion in this era led to unprecedented prosperity for some, and unprecedented misery for others. But in 1877, at the end of the Reconstruction Era, the process of westward expansion was not yet complete."
Social Studies,"Many of the political, social, and economic consequences of the events in this time period would become even more pronounced in the last years of the 19th Century.."
Social Studies,"and repeatedly during the 19th Century, when compromises in 1820 and 1850 barely maintained the fragile balance between Northern and Southern states. But in 1860, the wheels finally came off, and the Southern states seceded from the Union, starting the Civil War."
Social Studies,"After more than 80 years of compromise, why did the differences between the North and the South finally become irreconcilable in the 1850s? In other videos we've traced the differences and similarities between the North and South from the Colonial Era until the late 1840s in terms of economics, social structure, and commonly held ideas about slavery. Let's revisit those comparisons for the years immediately leading up to the Civil War and see if we can identify why the conflict intensified in the 1850s."
Social Studies,"The difference between the economies of the North and South began way back at the outset of colonization in North America when the cold climate of the North prevented large scale plantation agriculture. Instead the Northern economy centered on trade and manufacturing. The first and second Industrial Revolution turned the Northern economy into one based on factories, where men, women and children worked for long hours, sometimes in dangerous conditions."
Social Studies,"In the 1840s the potato famine in Ireland and revolutions in Europe prompted many Irish and German immigrants to come to Northern cities in search of factory jobs. But even though most factory workers in the North struggled to make ends meet, there was some opportunity for social mobility, to climb the economic ladder. Therefore, the North also had a growing middle class in the mid-19th Century."
Social Studies,"Many in the lower class held out hope that they could move out West and start a small family farm in order to become financially stable. So to recap, the class structure in the North looked kind of like this. A large working class of laborers, many of them immigrants, a middle class of managers and small business owners, and a small upper class of factory owners, bankers and successful merchants."
Social Studies,"In the South, cultivating valuable cash crops to sell on the national and international markets had always been the center of the economy. Cotton had slowly replaced tobacco as the number one crop in the South, and American cotton plantations were producing nearly 70 percent of the world's cotton supply by 1860. With agriculture working out so well for plantation owners, there was no need to industrialize as in the North."
Social Studies,"All the labor on plantations was done by enslaved people, who had no hope of improving their lot in life except by running away. There was also a large number of poor white farmers who owned no slaves, and a few modest planters that owned fewer than 10 enslaved people. Despite the popular myth of gigantic plantations across the South, only one-tenth of a percent of slaveholders owned more than 100 people."
Social Studies,"The class system in the South was extremely rigid and aristocratic, not far off from a medieval feudal society, with a handful of wealthy white families dominating in each Southern sate. Wealth was measured in the South by the number of enslaved people a planter owned. Poorer whites aspired to buy enslaved people and become plantation owners themselves, but their prospects of doing so were pretty slim by the 1850s."
Social Studies,"Growing cotton quickly depleted the soil, and so both large plantation owners and whites who dreamed of becoming large plantation owners looked to the West for new lands to cultivate in order to expand the cotton kingdom. In short, the class structure in the South looked a little like this. A large permanent under class of enslaved laborers, with non-slaveholding whites above them in rights and in economic power. Then there was a small number of planters who owned a few enslaved people."
Social Studies,"And at the very top was a tiny fraction of large planters who owned more than 100 enslaved people. So how did these economic differences lead to tension? Well first, there were tensions over whether the economic policy of the Federal Government promoted agriculture or manufacturing. Things like tariffs and the expansion of the railroad turned into bitter fights over whether the government was prioritizing the needs of one section or the other. And then there was westward expansion."
Social Studies,"Both Northerners and Southerners looked to the West for their future economic opportunities, and both sides suspected the other of trying to suppress their paths to social mobility. The ideologies of the North and South also diverged sharply in the 1850s. In the North, most whites didn't object to slavery as it existed in the South, but worried about the potential expansion of slavery to the West. The Free Soil Movement aimed to preserve Western lands for small white farmers."
Social Studies,"There was also a growing sense among Northerners that the South had too much power in the Federal Government thanks to the Three-Fifths Compromise, which granted Southern states representation in Congress for 60 percent of its disenfranchised enslaved population in addition to its white population. This was a fair charge to make."
Social Studies,"Many events of the 1850s like the Fugitive Slave Act, which compelled Northern whites to assist in capturing runaway slaves, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which reopened the possibility of allowing slavery north of the Missouri Compromise line, and the Supreme Court's decision in the case Dred Scott versus Sandford, which claimed that African-Americans weren't citizens, convinced Northerners that what they called the slave power, had come to dominate government."
Social Studies,"Consequently, the abolition movement, which called for the immediate end of slavery everywhere, grew considerably more mainstream in the 1850s. Writers like Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of the influential abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, activists like Frederick Douglas, who had escaped from slavery and toured the North lecturing about its evils, and vigilantes like John Brown, who led deadly raids on slaveholders, dramatized the moral evil of slavery to a growing audience in this time period."
Social Studies,"In contrast to the North, white Southerners believed they had the Constitution on their side, and that Northern attempts to limit the expansion of slavery constituted an assault on their liberty. In addition, white Southerners began to craft a proactive defense of the institution of slavery in the 1850s. Instead of treating slavery like the South's embarrassing, but necessary, peculiar institution as they had in the past, Southern commentators began to frame slavery as a positive good."
Social Studies,"They pointed to the conditions of immigrants in Northern factories, who might be injured in an accident at work, and then be fired for no longer being productive. Slave owners argued that they treated their enslaved laborers better than Northern factory owners treated their wage slaves."
Social Studies,"Southern sociologist George Fitzhugh wrote two books arguing that slavery was preferable to the kill or be killed environment of unbridled capitalism, and that poor whites should be enslaved in addition to people of African descent in order to protect them from being eaten alive in the free market. In looking at these economic, social, and ideological differences between the North and South, it's clear that by the 1850s there was really a clash of cultures going on."
Social Studies,"Would the United Stated be an agricultural nation, or an industrial one? One where anyone, no matter their color or place or birth, could climb the social ladder, or one where just a few deserved to enjoy all the blessings of liberty? In 1860, these questions would propel the country into civil war.."
Social Studies,"Originally a case about whether one man ought to be free, Dred Scott versus Sandford transformed into a case about African-American citizenship and the future of the institution of slavery itself. To learn more, I sought out help of two experts. Christopher Bracey is a Professor of Law at the George Washington University School of Law. He's an expert in US race relations, individual rights and criminal procedure. Timothy Huebner is the Irma O."
Social Studies,"Sternberg Professor of History at Rhodes College and the author of Liberty and Union: The Civil War Era and American Constitutionalism. Professor Bracey can you take us through a little bit, just who was Dred Scott and why did he bring this case? - [Christopher] So Dred Scott was born around 1800 and was the slave of Peter and Elizabeth Taylor Blow. In 1818, Peter Blow decides to move his family and Dred Scott to Alabama where he'd bought a cotton plantation."
Social Studies,"That didn't go so well, so he sells the plantation and moves the family and Dred to St. Louis, Missouri, where he'd purchased a boarding house called The Jefferson Hotel. - [Timothy] And that period really was a period during which the nation was arguing over the status of slaves and the rights of slaveholders and the future of slavery in new western territories."
Social Studies,"And this issue came up in a very significant way and a very controversial way in the question of the future of slavery in the territory and ultimately the state of Missouri. After two years of arguing over this, finally in 1820 and 1821, a sort of compromise was set out by members of Congress. North of the southern border of Missouri, with the exception of the state of Missouri, slavery would be banned. - [Christopher] In 1830, Elizabeth Taylor Blow dies and Peter himself dies two years later."
Social Studies,"But before he does, he makes an arrangement to sell Dred to an Army physician by the name of Dr. Emerson. Dr. Emerson is an Army physician, so he's gonna be stationed in a lot of different places, not just in the slave state of Missouri. In fact, it turns out that Dr. Emerson's first posting with Dred takes him to Fort Armstrong, which is located in Rock Island, Illinois and Illinois is of course a free state."
Social Studies,"Under both federal law and Missouri law as understood at the time, Dred would have lost his slave status and become a free man as soon as he stepped foot onto free territory. This was known as the Extra-territorial Emancipation Doctrine. - [Timothy] It was perfectly legal and perfectly possible for a slave sojourner, a slave who had been taken into a free state or free territory, to file suit for his freedom. - [Christopher] Dr. Emerson marries Eliza Irene Sandford of St. Louis. Dr."
Social Studies,"Emerson eventually dies in 1843 and he leaves the entire estate, including the Scotts, to Mrs. Emerson. Mrs. Emerson decides she would like to hire Dred out to make some money for herself. Rather than be hired out, Dred offers to purchase his own freedom, and the freedom of his entire family. But Mrs. Emerson refuses to allow Dred to buy out the freedom of his family. So Dred Scott files a civil lawsuit, what was called a Freedom Suit back then, in the Missouri State court. And his claim was that Mrs."
Social Studies,"Emerson was falsely imprisoning him and his family. - [Timothy] And he was able to do this with the help of the sons of his formers owners. - [Christopher] The lawyer is being paid by the children of Peter and Elizabeth Taylor Blow, - [Narrator] Wow. Dred Scott's first master. In the meantime you have a new development, Mrs. Emerson has remarried to Republican congressman Calvin Chaffee, from Massachusetts and he can't be a slave owner and still be a Republican congressman from Massachusetts. So Mrs."
Social Studies,"Emerson transfers title of the Scotts to her brother John Sandford who is a resident of New York, with business ties in St. Louis. - [Timothy] Now it was eligible for the case to go into Federal Court in that it involved people who lived in two different states."
Social Studies,"- [Christopher] So now you might be thinking, ""Well, filing a lawsuit against your purported master, that's pretty brave stuff."" But as it turns out freedoms suits of this nature were not that uncommon, particularly in border states where the slavery question was hotly disputed. Indeed there were some 300 or so of these freedom suits that were filed in Missouri during the period in which Dred Scott filed his case."
Social Studies,Many people viewed the Missouri Compromise as not so much of a compromise but as something that was forced upon the slave states. And then you've got the Kansas-Nebraska Act which gave similar autonomy to those areas to decide the slavery question and whether or not it would be introduced into those territories.
Social Studies,"- [Narrator] Interesting, so people in the North who opposed slavery or at the very least didn't want slavery to expand, would have been looking in the 1850s and saying, ""Hey I thought we already decided this, there wouldn't be slavery north of this line and now you're saying maybe Kansas and Nebraska could be slave states."" - [Timothy] Right and that was a huge issue in national politics because northerners are starting to grow very suspicious of southerners on the slavery issue."
Social Studies,"They're starting to speak of what they called the slave power, that southern slaveholders held all of this power in Washington and that they were running the show. And that this 1854 act had made it possible for slavery to potentially expand into an area where previously it had been banned."
Social Studies,- [Christopher] And you really do get this escalation of tension and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 which basically forced requirements upon free states to ensure the longevity of the slave states by requiring them to undertake certain behaviors and the return of fugitive slaves only escalated the tension and concern about the status of slavery in American life.
Social Studies,"- [Narrator] Alright so we're in this incredibly tense time of the 1850s with the slavery question yet unanswered and Dred Scott and his case gets to the Supreme Court. So how does the Supreme Court rule on this? - [Christopher] In a seven to two ruling, the Supreme Court held that Dred Scott was not a citizen of the United States, and so therefore he could not bring his freedom suit before federal court, which is really a jurisdictional question."
Social Studies,"But then the Court also goes on to invalidate the Missouri Compromise, despite finding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. - [Timothy] What happens when the case is being argued is that one of the arguments that's introduced is this idea that when Scott had been taken into free territory, he wasn't necessarily free because the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"And so what the Court ends up doing is not only ruling on the status of Scott, but also on the status of slavery in these federal territories in the west and the extent of the powers of Congress over slavery in the west. - [Narrator] Interesting so Chief Justice Roger Taney is then leading the Supreme Court and he, I guess, leads the reasoning about this case."
Social Studies,"So what were some of the arguments that he eventually accepted and made in his decision? - [Timothy] Chief Justice Taney's a very interesting figure. He had been on the court for many years. He, in his early years, had been moderately anti-slavery, had freed most of his own slaves, and had made anti-slavery statements. But by 1857 Taney reflected the larger change that had taken place within his political party, Taney was a Democrat."
Social Studies,"And the Democratic party had become more Southern dominated and more pro-slavery. And Taney then, by 1857, really is a symbol of pro-slavery Southern thought. - [Christopher] Justice Taney's opinion is somewhat notorious. He makes a series of arguments and one is legal, the others are really not legal arguments as I'll explain. What he starts out by saying is that just because you're a citizen of a state, that does not make you a citizen of the United States."
Social Studies,He says basically the federal government has exclusive authority to decide who is a citizen of the United States. Then he makes a second argument and he says even if Dred Scott were a citizen of the state of Missouri he would not be a citizen of the United States because he's black. And what he meant by that is that the word citizen as used in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence categorically excluded members of the Negro race.
Social Studies,"- [Narrator] This is fascinating because it seems to me like Justice Taney may have been ignoring a long history of free people of color in the United States who had voting rights, who had property rights. - [Timothy] He was and that was part of the criticism of the majority opinion that comes in, especially the dissent written by Justice Benjamin Curtis."
Social Studies,"Curtis had the lengthier of the two dissents and the more thorough legal argument because, as you point out, that in five states at the time of the founding, that African-Americans did exercise the right to vote that was a sign or some sort of an indication of their status as citizens."
Social Studies,"And so the argument made by Justice Curtis then, is that Taney's reading of history was that the founders had not intended for African-Americans to be part of the people or the citizens that were referred to in the text of the US Constitution."
Social Studies,"- [Christopher] What Justice Taney has done here has basically created a blind spot for himself and he goes on to point out that this is not his belief, this belief in Negro inferiority, but he said that it was a fixed and universal belief within the civilized portion of the white race, he said it was an axiom, a truth. But what's interesting is that he says this without a citation."
Social Studies,"He says that these aren't his views, these are the views of the framers, the great men who were high in literary accomplishment, high in their sense of honor. He said that they perfectly understood the language that they used, and how it would be understood by others."
Social Studies,"And there's this great quote in the opinion where he says that they, the framers, knew that it would not in any part of the civilized world be supposed to embrace the Negro race, which by common consent had been excluded from civilized governments and the family of nations and doomed to slavery. What Justice Taney has done here, is he's attempted to rewrite history."
Social Studies,"- [Narrator] So how the American people respond to the Dred Scott decision at large? Where they generally for it, or aghast by it? - [Timothy] Well as you might expect, things were split exactly down the middle. What we see in the South is white Southerners believe that the ruling is a vindication of what they had been arguing. Southerners had been arguing for many years going back to John C. Calhoun, that Southerners and that Southern slave holders had a bundle of rights."
Social Studies,And they argued that they had the right to own slaves as property in the southern states. They argued that they had a right to recapture fugitive slaves who escaped into the north and they also argued that they had a right to take slaves into the west. And so Southerners then feel that the Court and the US Constitution are on their side.
Social Studies,"You see a lot of folks in the north who are hostile to what the Court has done, because once again they see it as further evidence that the Court is dominated by the Democratic party, by the slave power. And many of these folks then are going to be members of a new party, and that was of course the Republican Party."
Social Studies,"- [Christopher] I think the abolitionists were furious and I think Frederick Douglas' statement calling it a brazen misstatement of facts of history, a scandalous and devilish perversion of the Constitution resonated and even future Presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, that same summer that the case was decided, went out and denounced it publicly. - [Narrator] So Lincoln of course wins the election of November 1860 which becomes a precipitating event of the Civil War."
Social Studies,"Do you see the Dred Scott decision as being a really important cause of the Civil War? - [Timothy] Yeah so these things are all linked, absolutely. Think about the ruling by Taney in Dred Scott ruling that slave-holders rights are absolute. Taney rules African-Americans have no rights, slaveholders have total rights. This makes it possible for Lincoln to rise as a political leader in the north because he has something that he can strongly criticize."
Social Studies,"Lincoln basically makes the argument that the founders had hoped for slavery to disappear ultimately. And Taney's making exactly the opposite argument. So the interesting thing is, if you think about how this story ends, it ends in March of 1861 when Abraham Lincoln is sworn-in as the 16th President. And who swears him in? Of course Roger B. Taney."
Social Studies,"So between the time when Lincoln was elected in November of 1860 and the time when he takes that oath of office in March of 1861, seven Southern slave-holding states, those are the states that leave the Federal Union first. Four other states of course will join them, but not until after the Civil War has already started. - [Narrator] So there's no Compromise of 1860, instead what we get is a four-year long Civil War where more than 620,000 Americans are killed."
Social Studies,"And at the end of that war, the North, the United States is victorious and slavery in the 13th Amendment is abolished forever. How does the end of the Civil War relate back to the Dred Scott case? - [Timothy] The 13th Amendment ends slavery, the 14th Amendment has to undermine or overturn the other part of the Supreme Court's ruling which was this issue of the rights of those who previously had been held as slaves."
Social Studies,"And the 14th Amendment is going to do that work by stating that all who were born in this country, by virtue of their birth here are citizens and that they have rights that will be protected by the Federal government. And if you think about it, what has changed, what has shifted, is the whole national discourse of rights, from the emphasis on the rights of slaveholders that we see in 1857, to an emphasis on the rights of those who previously had been held as slaves."
Social Studies,"And arguably then what we see during the Civil War and Reconstruction is the advent of a new discourse focusing on human rights. And that I would argue is profoundly significant. - [Narrator] So what happened to Dred Scott after this? Did he and his wife live to see the end of the Civil War and the end of slavery? - [Christopher] Unfortunately Dred Scott did not. The Supreme Court renders its decision in 1857 but he dies, unfortunately in 1858. His wife Harriet though, lives on to about 1876."
Social Studies,"So she did live to see the end of the Civil War and the end of slavery. The Dred Scott case made clear, at the time, that the struggle for citizenship and of course the later struggle for civil rights, is about the desire to be treated with equal dignity, to be viewed as possessing equal humanity."
Social Studies,"And what is perhaps most moving, I think, about the Dred Scott case is the dignity with which the Scotts carried themselves throughout the entire ordeal, despite the Court's best efforts to deprive them of that dignity. It was ultimately Dred and Harriet who gained the respect of the nation. And it was the inhumanity of the Court and the institution of slavery that was laid bare for all to see."
Social Studies,- [Narrator] So we've learned that the ruling in Dred Scott helped bring about the Civil War by further dividing the North and South over the issue of slavery. Opposition to the case's outcome propelled Abraham Lincoln to the national political stage and opposition to Abraham Lincoln propelled slave states to secede after his election as President. But the Dred Scott case was also about the lives and fates of one man and his family.
Social Studies,"Although Dred didn't survive to see the end of slavery and the passage of the 14th Amendment granting equal citizenship to African-Americans, his family lived to see the rewards of the struggle he began.

Social Studies,"In school, you learn about the Civil War, you learn about slavery, that slavery was a cause of the Civil War, but at least for myself, I never got a full context of what were all the dynamics that led to the Civil War? Was it just something that happened overnight? - [Kim] Oh, defnitely not. You know, I think the seeds of the Civil War were really with the United States at its creation. I think there's sort of an essential contradiction in the United States as it's born."
Social Studies,"We're this country where all men are created equal, except that most of the states in the South have slavery, where people are clearly not created equal, so they couldn't win the Revolutionary War without including those states and kind of giving them what they wanted in retaining slavery, but it means that the US is born with both free states and slave states, and they're gonna continue to try to figure out how to balance those for the rest of the 1800s. - [Sal] We have this map here."
Social Studies,"This map is a later period, but it shows... This is actually closer to the Civil War, but if we even look at the original 13 colonies, you can see which ones were free states and which ones were slave states, and then you obviously have these other states that come in later, which we'll talk about. What you're saying is, at the founding of the country, this was already an issue."
Social Studies,"There were people in the North who weren't fans of slavery, and people knew that at some point this would be irreconcilable, or maybe they hoped that it would be a (laughs) reconcilable difference. They said, ""No, we gotta unify against Great Britain."" - [Kim] Exactly. - [Sal] So they said, ""Let's just become a country and do it."" - [Kim] You know, even Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, he knew that slavery was a contradiction."
Social Studies,"He called the issue of having slavery ""like holding a wolf by the ears."" You can't hold onto it, but you can't let it go because so many of the wealthy elites who were going to end up in Congress in the South are slaveowners-- - [Sal] Including himself. - [Kim] Exactly, so they wanna protect their interests. - [Sal] So, the issue is there from the moment that the country is founded, and then we get into the 1800s, which is really the run-up."
Social Studies,"The Civil War doesn't start until we get into 1860 or shortly thereafter, or actually, 1860. What's the big picture that really leads up to it? - [Kim] Well, I think what we're looking at when we get into the issues that lead to the Civil War, it's really about how the US handles getting new territory. - [Sal] And the US was getting a lot of new territory. We have a map here. I guess the first really big chunk is you have the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and so you get all of... Let me shade it in."
Social Studies,"You get roughly all of this stuff right over here, so that's new areas that settlers can go, and it becomes officially a part of the US, and what else happens? - [Kim] So, as we get these new territories, out of them you're gonna get new states, and when new states come into the Union, they're going to come in as either free states or slave states, so we've balanced the interests of the North and South up until this point, from the Revolutionary War, so that there's equal representation in Congress between free states and slave states."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Well, why does someone care? If I'm someone in Massachusetts, why do I care whether the new state of Missouri is going to be a free state or a slave state? - [Kim] Well, I think there are two reasons why you might care. First, if you're an abolitionist, and these are the people who we know very well, like Frederick Douglass, or William Lloyd Garrison, who was the editor of the newspaper The Liberator. These are the people who feel that, correctly, slavery is morally wrong."
Social Studies,"Slavery is a corruption of the essential principles on which the country was founded. It's something that destroys lives, destroys families, but another reason if you're, say, in Massachusetts or Pennsylvania, why you might care whether a new state is a slave state, is you're worried about opportunities for yourself out in the West."
Social Studies,"We know that Horace Greeley, this famous newspaper editor, he says, ""What do you do if you're a young man in New York, a young white man, who doesn't know how to get ahead?"" He says, ""Go West, young man."
Social Studies,"""You can go out there, you can get some land, ""you can start a farm, but if you go out there ""and you find that all of the land has been bought up ""by rich slaveholders from the South, ""you might not be able to get any land, ""and you certainly might not be able to, ""for example, sell your corn at a rate low enough ""that you could beat somebody who has free labor."" - [Sal] So, a lot of times there's a lot of focus on the moral argument, which is a very strong argument, but there's also this interesting economic argument which you just talked about, which is it's hard to compete with slavery."
Social Studies,"I mean, you're literally talking about labor that does not need traditional wages. - [Kim] Right. - [Sal] That is literally slave labor, and so if you were having your own farm and you don't own slaves, how are you going to compete with that? So, that was the reason for some folks in the North, an economic argument."
Social Studies,"Now, would these people be considered abolitionists? - [Kim] No, the way that we think about those, we call them ""anti-slavery."" So, anti-slavery advocates, they don't think that they can get rid of slavery in the South. Even if they don't like slavery in the South, they don't even see how it would be possible to get rid of it, but they do think that as these new states are coming into the Union, they could prevent them from becoming slave states, so that it's possible for the Western lands to remain free."
Social Studies,"Abraham Lincoln, I think, is a really good poster child for this. I think we'll talk about him a little bit more later, but Lincoln is born in Kentucky, one of these new, Western states. His father is a small, white farmer, and slaveowners move into Kentucky."
Social Studies,"Later it becomes a slave state, and his father can't find work, his father can't find land, so he ends up first having to move to Indiana, then moving to Illinois, so this is literally a case of one of these poor, white farmers who just can't compete with slavery, which is one reason why Lincoln himself is later gonna come out so strongly in favor of making sure there's no slavery in the West."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So, abolitionists: slavery is amoral, it needs to be removed from, definitely the United States, possibly the world. - [Kim] Yeah, absolutely. - [Sal] Anti-slavery: they also think slavery is bad, they don't like it, but they think it's, ""Well, but I'm not gonna fight that fight to remove it. ""Maybe that's hard to do, or impossible, ""but it shouldn't spread. ""It's not fair. ""It's the reason my dad wasn't able ""to be able to run his farm."" - [Kim] Absolutely."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So, you have the Louisiana Purchase, and in other videos we talk about that famously Napoleon sold it for quite cheap, because frankly, he couldn't defend it (Kim laughs) because he was fighting these wars in Europe. That's the first chunk of land, so you have all of these states, and they need to figure out whether they're slave states or free states, but why would... I mean, I talked about why would a Northerner care whether a slave or a free state."
Social Studies,"Why would a Southerner care? If I'm a slaveowner, I own a plantation in South Carolina or Georgia, why do I care if Missouri is a slave state or a free state? - [Kim] Well I think, just as their political interests are tied up in slavery, all of their money is tied up in slavery. In 1860, the most valuable thing that anyone owns in the United States is slaves."
Social Studies,"You can't compete with that kind of money, so they wanna make sure that if a new state comes into the Union, that state isn't a free state because then the free states might have more representation in Congress, and then they can vote to outlaw slavery. So, if your whole fortune is built on slavery, if you're a white slaveowner, they outlaw that, then you're left with nothing."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] I see, so the North, there's the moral argument, there's the economic argument, slavery is hard to compete with, and in the South, ""Hey, if we have too many ""of these free states, at some point they're gonna have ""enough of a voting power in the government ""to maybe abolish slavery one day,"" which would completely undermine, if I'm a slaveowner, my economics of my reality. - [Kim] Right, and they are sort of essentially amoral."
Social Studies,"Even someone like Jefferson who knows that slavery is wrong, his whole wealth, his whole fortune, his whole political dynasty is built on the fortune of owning slaves. - [Sal] You know, one of the first points where this really gets balanced, this issue, is we have the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, then starting to carve out the Louisiana Purchase, you have states like Missouri."
Social Studies,"They get to their critical mass of people, of population, so that they can become a state, and so what was the Missouri Compromise all about in 1820? - [Kim] So, the Missouri Compromise is when we have enough people living in Missouri. These are white people, generally, who have come from the Eastern states, and they apply for statehood."
Social Studies,"You've got an equal number of slave states and free states already in Congress, so if Missouri comes in and they wanna be a slave state, they're going to upset the apple cart. They're gonna upset the balance, so there will be more representatives for the South than there will be for North, and everything they've done so far has been predicated on this tenuous balance between free states and slave states."
Social Studies,"So, they debate this in Congress for months, and eventually what they do is say, ""All right, well, we can't decide, ""so what we're going to do is admit ""the state of Maine at the same time."" - [Sal] And Maine, the territory of Maine was already part of the United States."
Social Studies,"How was it not already a state? - [Kim] It was part of Massachusetts, but as you can see, it's really only tenuously connected to Massachusetts, so they divide this territory up so that it can have its own representation in Congress, so they say, ""All right, well, we can't solve this problem ""of the balance of power between free states ""and slave states right now, so what we're gonna do ""is just kind of extend our balance."
Social Studies,"""We're gonna keep this compromise going ""to make sure that there are the same number ""of free and slave states, so we'll let Missouri in ""as a slave state at the same time ""we let Maine in as a free state."" - [Sal] Fascinating. I see where this is going, that you have these very tenuous compromises while more and more territories are being added. It's exciting to see where all of this goes.."
Social Studies,"-  Yes absolutely. -  So it's kind of, you know, and today we all think it's morally reprehensible thing but you go back not too far in the whole scope of history. We're going to the early 1800s, and this was something that was debated. It was slavery was allowed in a large chunk of the United States. And in the last video, we talked about that this issue of slavery only got exacerbated the more territory that was added."
Social Studies,"You have the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 that adds all of this territory. You start having states getting carved. Once you get a critical population, a critical mass of people in a certain state they can apply to be, or in a certain territory, they can apply to be a state. And as each of these states are added, and they want to get representation, it's a political issue. You mentioned how the North, they didn't like it on moral grounds and if it was a slave state."
Social Studies,"And they also didn't like it on economic grounds 'cause it's hard to compete economically with slavery. While the South was afraid of losing its political power if more free states were to join the Union. And the Compromise of 1820, you mentioned that well that compromise, Missouri is a slave state. Maine gets carved out of Massachusetts, becomes a free state. But that didn't solve the problem. That problem only continues because we only add more territory."
Social Studies,"-  Yeah, I mean most of the history of the 1800s, when it comes to slavery, is a history of putting off the problem. Henry Clay becomes this very famous legislator because he's good at compromising. He's called the ""Great Compromiser"". So, instead of trying to actually solve the issue of slavery, which many people think of as an unsolvable problem. They're just saying, ""All right, well how can ""we put off a conflict over this a little bit longer?"" -  And they just keep doing that."
Social Studies,"You know, in 1836 the territory expands further, or it starts to I guess. The expansion is catalyzed further by you have the Texas Revolution. Texas get its independence from Mexico. Which itself got independence only a few decades before that from Spain. But so Texas, for a brief amount of time, is its own independent country. But then, it joins the US, it's annexed by the US in 1845. So it's more territory for the US, and that was slave territory."
Social Studies,"-  Right, yeah so again, this is an area in the South where most of the reasons that slavery existed in the South is because it's a very fertile agricultural region, right? Where the things that you grow, crops, are very labor-intensive. So they figure, how are we going to find enough people to grow these crops? And the answer is that they've been importing African slaves and forcing them to work."
Social Studies,"-  And the annexation of Texas, there's war disputes with Mexico which leads to even, another conflict with Mexico. This time with the US and Mexico. This is the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. But in the context of this conversation, the reason why it helped bring the slavery issue even more to a head, is that when the US wins it, it gets even more territory. It gets all of this area in the West, right over here. -  Right, it's more territory."
Social Studies,"And it's more sort of Southern territory which means that it has a high probability of becoming slave states. -  And so, this map that we looked at earlier in the other video, this is kind of showing what the US looked like as we exit out the Mexican-American War. We're getting to about 1850. And so, what happens then? I mean, is it just one compromise after another at this point? -  Well, this is the point where compromise begins to break down."
Social Studies,"Henry Clay again, is the architect of what's called the Compromise of 1850. As soon as the US goes to war with Mexico, people in Congress are wondering, ""All right, if we get this territory ""that we're trying to get, what's going to happen? ""Are they going to be free states or slave states?"" And this compromise over free and slave states has been going on for 30 years since the Missouri Compromise. And even longer, if you take it back to 1776. So, they're doing exactly the same thing."
Social Studies,"They're saying, ""All right, well let's try ""to keep a balance of power ""between free states and slave states."" Except, they add in a couple of provises that make people really angry in the 1850s. -  And who gets angry? -  Both I would say, slaveowners and Abolitionists and anti-slavery activists in the North. -  So, I guess that's what makes it a compromise. A little something to make everybody angry."
Social Studies,"(laughter) What made the slave owners angry about the Compromise of 1850? -  One of the parts of the Compromise of 1850, apart from deciding whether these new territories were going to be slave or free was a part of the Act, was called the Fugitive Slave Act. And the Fugitive Slave Act said that it was a federal offense not to help slave owners recover-- -  So this is something the Abolitionists angry? -  Yes."
Social Studies,"-  Or the anti-slavery angry? -  Yeah, absolutely both. So for example, if you're maybe living in Massachusetts, you're a white middle-class person living in Massachusetts, you don't think slavery is great. You think it's morally wrong, but it hasn't really directly affected your life. Right? You're hundreds of miles away from the nearest slave state."
Social Studies,"But now, the federal government says that if there is a person who has escaped from slavery who has come to your town, it is a federal offense for you not to help return that person to slavery. -  So this Fugitive Slave, this is part of the compromise? This is part of the Compromise of 1850. Is that I could be sitting in Massachusetts, I could be anti-slavery or I could even be ambivalent about it. But now, I have to be complicit in it. If there's a slave, I can't."
Social Studies,"Or if there's someone who's escapes from the South who is a former slave, I have to actively, I can't in any way help them. If I do, I could go to jail. If I'm a law officer, I have to capture that person, and I have to bring them back. So it's kind of forcing people who are already not happy about slavery, it's kind of bringing it close to them. They have to partake in it. -  Yeah, and these are people who have very strong religious convictions."
Social Studies,"This is the mid-19th century is a time when people feel their religion very strongly. And so, there are people in the North who are Quakers. Who are otherwise religiously opposed to slavery. Who have maybe prayed for the souls of slaves, but it's never been their job to try to keep someone in slavery before. So that is really infuriating. One of the things you get out this is a really strong backlash of Abolitionist sentiment in the North."
Social Studies,"For example, Harriet Beecher Stowe, she's the daughter of a reverend who's against slavery. She writes the book Uncle Tom's Cabin which becomes this smash hit. -  And when was this roughly? -  This was about 1852. -  OK, so this is after the Compromise of 1850. So, people are getting, it really is coming to a head. The people in the North, they're having to partake in this because of the Fugitive Slave Act. You have Harriet Beecher Stowe writes Uncle Tom's Cabin."
Social Studies,"It makes people even more upset about the realities of slavery. -  Right, and in the South, they've kind of gotten away, white slave owners in this time with people saying, ""Ya know, ""slavery's not really my problem. ""I don't like it."" But now they're seeing a concentrated attack, a moral and social attack against slavery in the North. And their response is to become even more violently in favor of slavery."
Social Studies,"They pose the idea that slavery is not just something that we could turn our eyes away from, but it's necessary. But it's a positive good. Slavery is actually going to actually make the country better. If it weren't for slavery, all of these enslaved Africans, African-Americans, their lives would be worse without us. -  And so, just to be clear on the Compromise of 1850. And there was a bunch of things, we went into a whole video on the Compromise of 1850, all of the different facets of it."
Social Studies,"But it's one of its, in terms of this conversation, one of its outcomes is because of the Fugitive Slave Law. It infuriated many of the anti-slavery Abolitionists in the North. They became more entrenched in their positions which made the Southerners more entrenched in their positions. The Southerners didn't necessarily, they liked the Fugitive Slave Law, the Southerners. The Compromise of 1850 sounds like it was, it was a compromise, not everyone was happy."
Social Studies,"But it sounds like it made the anti-slavery folks more unhappy than the slavery folks. -  Yeah absolutely. So it makes the anti-slavery folks super unhappy, but it also means that now white slave owners in the South, they feel like there's a target on their heads. And so, they're going to dig in even further to make sure that their interests in slavery are protected."
Social Studies,"-  And this gets us to the election of 1860 which I guess in some ways was the straw that breaks the camel's back, I guess from a Southern perspective. And why is that? -  Well, during the 1850s, you have all of these political battles over slavery. In fact, it kind of breaks the major political party of the 1850s, the Whig Party. So, in 1860, some of these leftover Whigs, they reorganize as the Republican Party."
Social Studies,"And this is the first election with a Republican Party that we know today. But obviously, in 1860, the things that they're interested in, their goals and aims are completely different. And the Republican Party is an anti-slavery party. They're deliberately and publicly against slavery. So, they nominate as their political candidate for 1860, Abraham Lincoln who is well-known in the country for having been an anti-slavery agitator."
Social Studies,"He's given many speeches where he has made very eloquent arguments against slavery. -  He's, we talked about in the previous video, he's against it, I guess on moral grounds. But perhaps even more, his old father wasn't able to be a successful farmer because he had to compete with slave owners. -  Right, so he's brought up to hate slavery because it's a big business that has harmed his own family's economic future."
Social Studies,"But, he comes, I think, to his own conclusion that slavery is morally wrong. What he doesn't think that he can do as president is legally or constitutionally, get rid of slavery. He doesn't think that the Constitution allows it. But, he is seen as enough of a threat by Southerners that in many cases, on the presidential ballots in 1860, you couldn't even vote for Abraham Lincoln if you wanted to. He didn't show up on the ballot in Southern states."
Social Studies,"Nonetheless, he still gets enough electoral votes that he's elected. -  And then that's what takes us into the real meat of, you know, catalyzes the Civil War. -  Yeah, stay tuned, Abraham Lincoln.."
Social Studies,"And a lot of folks view that as a bit of the final catalyst for the Civil War. What's happening? And is that accurate? -  So, Lincoln is elected as a Republican Party president. This is the first Republican Party president, ever. And the real basis of the Republican Party is an anti-slavery platform. They really don't want slavery to extend into the Western territories that have been acquired through the Mexican War."
Social Studies,"So, they have been making both an economic, and to some extent, moral argument against slavery. So, when Lincoln becomes president, the states of the South, particularly the Deep South, or this Cotton Belt area, whose entire economic system relies on slavery, they think that they are under attack. That Lincoln is going to be coming for slavery as soon as he gets a chance, as president. -  And we're talking about these states down here."
Social Studies,"This is Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. -  Right; so these are the real cotton states, where slavery is highly entrenched. There, more than 50% of the population is enslaved working on cotton plantations. And it's making the elite people, elite whites in the South, very wealthy. Cotton is just the backbone of their economy. -  So what do they do? Lincoln gets elected. This is November of 1860? -  That's right."
Social Studies,"-  So what do they do about it? They're afraid. -  They're afraid that Lincoln is going to do something about slavery. So, over the course of this winter period, this is in a period before we moved the inauguration up to January, so it used to be that presidents would be elected in November and not take office until March. -  Yeah, we have here, this Lincoln gets elected in November, but then he doesn't get inaugurated until March, over here."
Social Studies,"-  So there's this long, lame duck period where everyone knows that a new political party is going to be in power, a new president is in power, but he's not in office yet. -  And so you have James Buchanan sitting around; he's still the president, but. -  But, yeah, his days are numbered, and his power is pretty limited."
Social Studies,"So, over the course of what they call this Secession Winter, the seven states of the Deep South get together and they secede from the Union, one after another. And this includes South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. They secede from the Union, and they form what they call The Confederate States of America, which is, basically, almost exactly the same as The United States of America. Their constitution is based very closely on the US Constitution."
Social Studies,"But it guarantees the existence of slavery. It explicitly says that slavery is allowed and protected forever. And they elect Jefferson Davis as their president. -  So when they seceded, for them it was clearly about slavery. -  Right; everything is about slavery. They are concerned that Lincoln is going to interfere with slavery."
Social Studies,"They are afraid that because slavery is being outlawed many other places in the world, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, that, one way or another, slavery's days are numbered. And if they're going to protect their livelihood as slave owners and as cotton planters, they're going to have to form their own nation to make sure that it's protected. -  And James Buchanan is officially president when all of this has happened."
Social Studies,"You have seven states of the United States, I guess they're not so united anymore, leaving. Is he just powerless to do anything? -  Well, he tries a few things. He was a very ineffective president to begin with. It's hard to be an effective president when Congress is so divided over issues."
Social Studies,"One thing that Congress actually does before Lincoln is in office, and before these states officially secede, is they try what's called the Crittenden Plan, proposed by John Crittenden of Kentucky, saying we will officially protect slavery in the Constitution. We will say that you can't outlaw slavery in the South, and we'll even extend this Missouri Compromise line, which was sort of the official line between North and South, between free states and slave states, all the way to the Pacific."
Social Studies,"So, just so you know, Southern states, we'll make sure that we won't get rid of slavery. -  So this Crittenden Compromise, this was kind of a last ditch effort. Everyone's started to see the writing on the wall. These seven states, especially, were very loose-in-the-socket. -  And this was a last ditch effort to keep them in the Union, perhaps. -  Yeah, and I don't want to say it's too little too late, but for the South, they have seen the writing on the wall."
Social Studies,"They have seen that this is going to be their only opportunity to secede. -  Lincoln got elected, and his whole party is based on being anti-slavery. -  Right. So, they want to get out while the getting is good. So that they can make sure that slavery remains in their states. -  All right, so during this lame duck period, the seven states, these Deep South states, they secede. Then Lincoln gets inaugurated. He is now president. And we're not really in the Civil War yet."
Social Studies,"-  No, in fact, Lincoln's inaugural address is very conciliatory. We think of Lincoln as being a really great orator. And he certainly was, but his first inaugural address, if you read it, is very much a plea to the South, saying hey, really, I'm not planning on outlawing slavery. So, the anti-slavery platform that Lincoln ascribes to is specifically about not extending slavery to the West."
Social Studies,"So he's saying I'm not in favor of getting rid of slavery where it is, so there's no reason for you all to secede. Come back, everything will be situation normal. -  And they don't. -  No, as I said, they've already seen that this is their opportunity to make sure that slavery continues, by creating their own nation."
Social Studies,"So, in the South, there are a bunch of arsenals and forts that belong to the United States; and most of these are taken over by the Confederacy when it becomes its own nation. -  This is a picture of one right here. This is Sumter. -  Right; so Fort Sumter is right in Charleston Harbor. And this is a Union fort, or a United States fort, that's holding out, basically. They're running out of supplies, they have tried to have supplies brought in to them before, which have been repelled."
Social Studies,"-  They're holding out. They're well in Confederate territory, but they're still controlled by United States soldiers. -  Right; so, they do not want to surrender this fort. Lincoln lets the Confederates, the Rebels, know that he wants to resupply this fort. The Confederates instead fire on Fort Sumter. They start lobbing artillery at it. Over the course of a day, they force the Union forces in Fort Sumter to surrender. -  I guess this was the real matchstick for the war."
Social Studies,"But this wasn't the first tension. -  No; obviously this had been going on for some time. -  Even in Buchanan's lame duck period, there's probably a little bit of tension. -  Yeah, if you want to be expansive, you could say that this tension is almost built into the Constitution when they don't-- -  (laughs) -  (laughs) secede. -  You got that right."
Social Studies,"But especially, even post-secession of these first seven states, there are already some tensions, especially if they're taking over these forts. Former United States soldiers are now thinking about cutting off supplies to current United States soldiers. And then Fort Sumter, it sounds like this was definitely the straw that breaks the camel's back, so to speak. -  Yeah, this is the tinder box. And I think it's maybe intended to be a tinder box on both sides."
Social Studies,"Because Lincoln wants to be sure that if there's going to be a war, the North isn't going to fire the first shot. They want to make sure that this is the South's decision. It can be blamed on them if it needs to be. -  This is a pattern you see throughout history, is that no one at least wants to, officially, be the person to fire the first shot. They often look for a good reason to fire the first shot because they want to get into war, but everyone wants to have the moral high ground."
Social Studies,"-  Right; and in the South, they are looking to make sure that this is kind of a morale building moment. When they fire on Fort Sumter, they're firing on a federal fort, right? -  Mm-hmm. -  In any circumstances, that's going to bring on war. And they're hoping that if they can kind of get this fire started, then these four other slaveholding states, or actually eight other slaveholding states, in the South are going to join the effort."
Social Studies,"And that's pretty much exactly what happens. So, after they fire on Fort Sumter, the fort is surrendered to the Confederacy. Lincoln says, okay, you want to start a war, we got a war. He calls for 75,000 troops, volunteers to put down the insurrection. He calls them for a 90-day service period, which tells you how long they thought this was gonna last. After Lincoln has asked for this army, four more slaveholding states in the South secede."
Social Studies,"And that's Virginia, the most important of these, it's gonna be the real battleground of the Civil War. -  Today, we'd consider that West Virginia and Virginia, but that was Virginia back then. -  Right; Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina also join the Confederate States of America. And the war is on. -  Fascinating.."
Social Studies,"-  And then what was the first major conflict? - [Kim] So the first major conflict comes after a number of months. There are a couple of little skirmishes here and there, but nothing super large until about 60,000 troops meet outside of Manassas, Virginia, at a place called Bull Run. An interesting fact, I think, is that Union armies and Confederate armies actually named battles different things, if you've ever been confused about this."
Social Studies,"The Union armies tended to name battles after bodies of water, whereas the Confederate armies tended to name them by nearby towns. So if you've ever heard the Battle of Manassas and the Battle of Bull Run, they're the same thing, it's just the Union officers are talking about this creek, Bull Run, whereas the Confederates are talking about the town nearby. -  I see, and the 60,000 troops between the two of them. - [Kim] Right."
Social Studies,"So they meet, and this is very close to Washington, D.C., so much so that people go out and they bring picnics to watch this battle. -  They think it's going to be entertaining. - [Kim] Yeah, they think it's going to be like a football game. And it is not like a football game. It is a gigantic battle, 800 people die that day, which doesn't sound like a lot to us, but it was the most deadly battle ever in American history up until that point."
Social Studies,"So it's a Confederate victory, which is very surprising to the Union, because they think that they have such superior forces that this is really going to be a very short war. And this is a quick rebellion, in 90 days we're going to be able to, you know, suppress this rebellion and that'll be it. But Bull Run is really the first sign that this is going to be a major war. It's not going to be quick and it is going to be very deadly. -  This was July of... - [Both] 1861."
Social Studies,"-  Okay, so now it's clear to both sides, especially, I guess you could say the North, that this is not going to be a short war. So they need to prepare. How are they approaching this? - [Kim] Well, so both sides have some advantages and disadvantages. For the South, they have some of the same advantages that the United States would have had during the war for independence."
Social Studies,"They have home court advantage, we could say, which is that they know the territory very well and also there's a real incentive for people to protect their homes, right. You're gonna care more about a war that's happening on your property than a war that's gonna happen very far away. The other advantage that they have is just really, really terrific military leadership. So they have Robert E. Lee, who is widely considered the greatest general of his era. He's truly a military genius."
Social Studies,"He, in fact, was offered a commission in the Union army but when Virginia seceded, he went with Virginia. He preferred his home state. So he is a terrific general. The Union is gonna really struggle to come up with the kind of military leadership that the South has. -  Who is in charge of the Union or the Northern armies? You said, the United States Army. - [Kim] The United States Army. The first general that Lincoln puts in charge is George B. McClellan."
Social Studies,"This is problematic for a lot of reasons. One is that George McClellan is a Democrat, so he doesn't agree politically with Lincoln. I think he would have preferred peace, in fact in 1864 he runs against Lincoln for President on a platform of letting the South go, basically. And so Lincoln is struggling to match the South when it comes to military leadership, but he does have other advantages. For one thing, there are four times as many free people in the North as there are in the South."
Social Studies,"-  And you made the point, free people. - [Kim] Right. -  Because the South, as you mentioned, it has a majority of the population was not free. - [Kim] I wouldn't say a majority of the population, in many states, -  In Deep South. - [Kim] In the Deep South states, right. But so there are only about 9,000,000 people living in the South, and of those 9,000,000 people 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 of them are enslaved."
Social Studies,"So they're not going to be fighting to continue the institution of slavery. By contrast, the North has 22,000,000 people and it also has a terrific industrial base. One of the major cultural differences between the North and South that leads to the Civil War is that the South is primarily agrarian, and the North becomes very industrial. But industry is really helpful in a war."
Social Studies,"They've got miles and miles of railroad tracks which means that they can move supplies very quickly, and they also have hundreds and hundreds of factories that make it easy for them to make munitions. -  This is the middle of the Industrial Revolution - [Kim] Right. -  and an industrial base matters a lot."
Social Studies,"And so what's, given the North's advantages and the South's advantages, what's their strategies, how do they try to play to their strengths? - [Kim] Right, so the South, they are basically trying to outlast the North. They know that they have this territory, and if the North wants them to come back into the Union, they're going to have to conquer this territory. And even though it's hard to kind of tell, the territory of the South is actually larger than Western Europe. -  Wow."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So in a way, the North has a bigger job to conquer the South than the Allies did in World War II, to conquer Europe. So they know that the North is gonna have to fight a war to conquer them, whereas the South just needs to win the war of waiting. -  Of attrition. - [Kim] Yeah, they're hoping that the North will get tired of fighting. -  Fighting in another person's land, you're not defending your own land."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Right, and they know that there are plenty of whites in the North who don't care about slavery. It's not in their.. -  They're indifferent, what do they care. - [Kim] Yeah, what do they care, in fact some people are afraid that if the slaves are freed in the South, they're all gonna come up North and they're going to compete for labor with poor white people."
Social Studies,"So there are plenty of whites in the North who have no interest in the slaves in the South being free, even if that's not an early war aim of the North. So the South is hoping that maybe they can win a couple of really big battles that show this isn't gonna be a big war. -  Or it'd be so painful for the North to try to conquer the South, so to speak."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] And they're also trying to show that they're serious, to an international audience, particularly England, because the South is producing 3/4 of the world's supply of cotton at this point, and England is an industrial nation which is built in many cases around textile manufacturing. So they're hoping that if they show that they are serious about their own nationhood that they're going to win this war against the North that England will intercede on their behalf to protect their supply of cotton."
Social Studies,"-  So this would be an appeal to England on purely economic grounds. - [Kim] Right. -  Fascinating. Because England, they didn't have slavery. - [Kim] No. -  But purely economically, at least, appeal to them. - [Kim] So on the other hand, the North's strategy is what they call ""The Anaconda Plan"". And the idea of the Anaconda Plan is that they are going to squeeze the South, economically. What they want to do, -  Like an anaconda. - [Kim] Like an anaconda, right."
Social Studies,"So they want to blockade the Atlantic ocean because they don't want the South to be able to sell their cotton to get money, and they also don't want the South to be able to buy the kinds of things that they're going to need to make a war happen. They also want to control the Mississippi River cuz that's the real main artery of commerce in the West. Anyone who is gonna be shipping their grain or their cotton is gonna be shipping it down the Mississippi to the port of New Orleans."
Social Studies,"So the Union hopes that if they can basically surround the South, and make sure nothing gets in or out, then eventually they're just gonna starve to death. -  This also goes through the industrial bays, it can also produce more ships and etc. - [Kim] Right, and it takes them a while to do that, in fact at the start of the war, the Union only has 90 ships. I've heard it compared to ""Five leaky boats""."
Social Studies,"Right, we're not a naval power at this point and so it's gonna take them a while to build up the kind of naval power they need to do that, cuz this is 3500 miles of coastline that they're gonna need to patrol."
Social Studies,"-  I'm just looking at this map, not getting too much into details, it looks like a lot of the battles are concentrated right in this Virginia/Maryland area, and then there's more, it's a little bit more sparse but you have a few that are in the Deep South and along this Mississippi corridor. - [Kim] There are two major theaters of the war. We'd say the Eastern Theater, and this is that 100-mile corridor between Washington and Richmond, where a huge amount of the fighting takes place."
Social Studies,"It's important to remember that the capital of the Confederacy and the capital of the United States are only 100 miles apart. -  This capital is, you can't see it on this map but it's someplace in the middle of Virginia, and then D.C., literally, as you mentioned you said it was 100 miles apart? - [Kim] Yep. -  Fascinating.."
Social Studies,"Shortly after his inauguration, you have the whole situation at Fort Sumter, which is really the start of the Civil War. We don't have the first major battle until we get to Bull Run. And the overall theaters of war, we have this corridor here in the Northeast in Virginia and Maryland. And you also have it in the west along the Mississippi. And the North, the strategy is well let's use our industrial base. Let's use our larger population. Let's use our navy to see if we can essentially blockade the South."
Social Studies,"Well the South says, ""Hey we have the home court. ""We have better leadership. ""We just need to outlast the North."" And so what happens as we get started, we talked about Bull Run being the first major battle. Who kind of comes out better in some of these first engagements? -  Well I think it's a surprise to everyone when the South does much better in the first year of the war than the North."
Social Studies,"Knowing the major advantages that the North has in industrial power, in railroads, and just in the sheer number of people, it's very surprising that the leadership in the South does such an incredible job of really blocking the North's advances. The North is attempting to take Richmond, and Lee repeatedly keeps General McClellan from getting to Richmond. -  Right and then Lee actually goes on the offensive to some degree."
Social Studies,"The South essentially wins in Bull Run, and they have a series of victories as you mentioned in year one. -  Right, so one problem that the North has is that Lincoln's generals are just not nearly as skilled. George B. McClellan that we've talked about, his idea of the South's power is perhaps considerably greater than the South's actual power. As he is forever telling Lincoln, ""I need more troops. ""I need more supplies."
Social Studies,"""Send me more things."" He loves parading his army, but I think he was actually a little too close to the troops himself. He was really afraid to lose anyone, which made him very popular with the army, but drove Lincoln crazy because the North comes out with this really strong numeric and industrial advantage. And as McClellan delays, it gives the South time to build things up over and over again."
Social Studies,"In fact Lincoln, who we often think of as being sort of this great-grandfatherly, sweet character, who has so many words of wisdom, his letters to McClellan are downright snarky. He says to McClellan, ""If you're not using the army, ""could I borrow it?"" (laughter) -  And is that what historians believe too? It looks like Lincoln felt that the reason why year one went in favor of the South. And what we talked about in previous years, everyone thought this was gonna be a fast engagement."
Social Studies,"The North had all of these advantages. Lincoln believed that maybe McClellan wasn't being aggressive enough. And do historians -  Yes absolutely. -  believe that too? -  Yeah, no I think that's true. It's really borne out by the numbers, that in many cases where McClellan thought he was facing just thousands of troops, he was really only facing a fraction of that."
Social Studies,"-  And so that made him be a little bit more cautious? -  He was very -  cautious. -  At what point is the turning point, at least in these early stages of the Civil War, as we have here in this timeline? We go from April 1861 to roughly April 1865. The first year, I can draw that. So the first year would be roughly this. We've had several battles after Bull Run, but then we get to Antietam."
Social Studies,"-  Right so Lee, since he's done so well in Virginia, he decides that he's gonna take the army to the North. This is the first time that he heads up into the border state of Maryland, and he meets at Antietam Creek with McClellan. -  And this goes back to the naming conventions between the North and South. It's called Antietam, that's the body of water, which the North does. This is Antietam right there."
Social Studies,"-  Right well the South refers to it as the nearby town which is Sharpsburg, Maryland. And once again, -  I see. -  this is a big deal. This is the South invading the North now, taking the offensive. -  Right and this is the bloodiest day in American history when-- -  Let me make sure I digested what you just said. The bloodiest day? I imagine things like Pearl Harbor and D-Day."
Social Studies,"-  Right, so 4,000 Americans died on a single day, September 17th, 1862 when these two armies meet at Antietam. And on no other day in American history have so many Americans died, not even on September 11th did that many Americans die. -  And was this a surprise to folks? -  Yeah, well I think one of the truisms, perhaps about military strategy in general, is that people are always planning for the last war."
Social Studies,"They're not planning for the next war, and so they learn from their mistakes, but what they don't know how to do always is anticipate what's going to be new about this war. And there were so many new inventions during this time period that really made the Civil War an incredibly deadly war. -  Yeah and you can see. These are pictures. These are Antietam right here? -  This is Antietam, yes. -  And this looks -  like Lincoln and McClellan."
Social Studies,"-  Right, meeting at Antietam. -  Which is incredibly bloody. And you talk about new technologies or new weapons, this rifle here looks like one of 'em. -  (chuckles) Yes. So this is a war where there's a transition from the musket to the rifle, and what's different about a rifle is that inside the barrel of a rifle, there is a sort of spiral-shaped groove. And the spiral-shaped groove makes the rifle much more accurate at a much farther distance."
Social Studies,"It's sort of the difference between just hurling a football end over end and throwing a spiral, so you can hit a target at 600 yards, which is much greater. -  Was unheard of -  for a musket or hard, very hard with a musket. So it gets the bullet spinning, which keeps it on its trajectory better. -  Exactly. So we have much more accurate technology and old military strategy."
Social Studies,"If you see paintings of, for example the Napoleonic Wars, just involved a whole bunch of soldiers lining up and going toward each other. Well when you've got soldiers in a line and very accurate weapons-- -  I never got why that ever made sense though. (Kim laughs) -  I'm not sure I do either to be perfectly -  Yeah I don't -  honest."
Social Studies,"-  consider myself -  a great military strategist, but wearing these (Kim laughs) bright uniforms and marching in step in these kind of-- -  Yeah it does -  seem to make you a very good target. -  Yes, yes, but anyway, you have the rifle now, much more accurate and you end up with scenes like this, but what was the outcome of Antietam? -  There are two very major outcomes of Antietam, I would say."
Social Studies,"One, on the negative side for the North, is this is a battle that is widely photographed as you can see. Mathew Brady, who was the leading photography studio owner of his time, and it's one t. -  Mathew, okay. -  Yeah, very important, only one t. -  Yes, a (Kim laughs) nontraditional spelling of Matthew. -  He sends out his photographer that works for him, named Alexander Gardner, and they have roving photographers for the first time. They have wagons."
Social Studies,"And they take-- -  'Cause -  photography's just becoming a used technology at this time. -  Right and so -  they have Alexander Gardner photograph the battlefields at Antietam. And as you can see. -  Like a E-R? -  That's right, yes. -  Gardner. -  As you can see, this is just about as far away from the kind of heroic paintings of what battles looked like that people had been used to seeing up until this point."
Social Studies,"These don't look like the sort of heroes of the Revolutionary War, like George Washington. This is, this is gruesome. -  Gruesome. -  And this is really fascinating 'cause we take it for granted in today's day and age is that the effect of media on people's perception of things like war. Before the camera, before photographs, if I'm a civilian, I just hear about these great stories, and I see these paintings that look very valiant and very heroic."
Social Studies,"But now with photographs, you see the grim reality of war, people just shot in their tracks. And young men just kind of just piled up. It's just very dark. -  Yeah and it's a real PR problem for the North because this is before we can really put photography in newspapers. They don't have that technology yet, but these photographs were put on display in Brady's studios. He had one in Washington, D.C."
Social Studies,"and one in New York City, and people would go and look at these photographs, and it was very shocking to them. It was a level of detail that they had never seen. In some cases, they could make out the faces of the individual men who were dead on the battlefield. And that just seemed beyond what was imaginable to these people. To think of some poor person going into one of these studios and seeing their son dead there on the battlefield made it very difficult for the North to keep up morale."
Social Studies,-  Fascinating..
Social Studies,"Over 4,000 people died, and Antietam was a signature victory in the Civil War for the North, for Abraham Lincoln, and the forces of the United States."
Social Studies,"One thing that was really important about Antietam was that Lincoln had been waiting for a Union victory, so that he could proclaim the Emancipation Proclamation, which was intended to be a real morale blow to the South, and also a signal to both enslaved people in the South, Northern Republicans who were strongly in favor of Abolition, the end of slavery, and also the world, especially Europe, that the Civil War had become a fight to end slavery, not just a fight to keep the Union together."
Social Studies,"I mentioned in the last video that there were two reasons why Antietam was so important, the first being that it led to the Emancipation Proclamation. The second reason was slightly related to that. The eyes of the world were really on the United States and on the Civil War at this time. Many people in Europe were trying to decide whether they should intervene in the American Civil War."
Social Studies,"Now, why would they do this? I think the most important reason that they would do this is because the South of the United States supplied 75% of the world's cotton at the beginning of the Civil War, and so to major industrialized nations, especially the United Kingdom, cotton was the source of their prosperity. They based their economy, in part, around textile mills. This is what England was known for."
Social Studies,"During the Civil War, the North blockaded the South, which meant that they used the ships of the Navy to prevent supplies from getting in or crops from getting out of the American South. If England can't get their cotton crops, they might be in a whole lot of trouble when it comes to textile manufacturing. In fact, the Confederacy was counting on having the support of Europe in their rebellion against the United States, partly for this reason."
Social Studies,"Now, there were other reasons why Europe might have intervened on behalf of the South. One of these was that Europe was traditionally a highly classed society, and they had a lot of sympathy for the way that the South did things with a wealthy planter class similar to the monarchy or the gentry in Europe, which was in control of poor whites and enslaved people of African descent."
Social Studies,"Another reason was that it was to the advantage of Europe not to have such a strong nation as the United States operating in the Americas. Remember that this is the era of Imperialism, the very beginning of Imperialism, as countries like the United Kingdom and France, Germany, and others in Europe begin to look for colonies abroad, and the United States had in 1820 proclaimed the Monroe Doctrine which said, ""Europe, keep out of the Americas."
Social Studies,"We consider this our area of the world."" Dividing what had been the United States into two smaller nations would probably have worked out in their favor, so Europe had these social or cultural reasons to join with the South and also political, or perhaps foreign policy reasons to join with the South. The South was really counting on the intervention of a European nation. They thought, certainly, the United Kingdom would intercede on their behalf."
Social Studies,"It looked, especially early in the Civil War, like that might be the case, but when it came down to it, the United Kingdom did not intercede for the South, and there were a few reasons why that happened. One of those reasons was that the South had kind of oversold cotton to England in the years leading up to the Civil War, so there was actually a considerable supply on hand which English merchants had built up before the Civil War, kind of seeing this coming."
Social Studies,"The loss of new Southern cotton really didn't turn out to be as big of a problem, as many had imagined. Related to that, as the Civil War began to ramp up, both Egypt and India, which were also cotton producers, began to increase their production, understanding there would be more of a demand coming from England that couldn't be supplied from the American South."
Social Studies,"It's interesting to note that it's partly in response to the American Civil War and the Northern blockade of Southern ships that Egypt and India become the world suppliers of cotton that they will be for the rest of the 19th Century. The other reason that England doesn't aid the South is more of a cultural reason, which I think is very interesting, which is that the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, which we'll talk about more in other videos, was read really widely in England, it was a very popular novel there."
Social Studies,"The stage shows of Uncle Tom's Cabin were quite common. This novel, which in the United States, helped to propel the Civil War by showing Northerners how barbaric the institution of slavery was, also came over to England."
Social Studies,"Because the battle of Antietam allowed Lincoln to make the Emancipation Proclamation, to the citizens of England, this meant now that the North was an army of liberation, that they had the choice of siding with either Southern slaveholders, who had been demonized in Uncle Tom's Cabin, or with Northerners, who were fighting against those slaveholders."
Social Studies,"Because of the Emancipation Proclamation, and because of these other side issues about the supply of cotton, Antietam really marks the moment where it becomes clear that there is not going to be any European help for the South. That's really important, because think of the American movement for independence. The reason that the United States won, or at least one reason that the United States won, was because of the intervention of France."
Social Studies,"The South knew that they needed the help of Europe if they were going to succeed. Had England interceded, it's highly likely that the South may have won the American Civil War, and it would have been a separate nation. After the Battle of Antietam and the Emancipation Proclamation, it became clear that if the South was going to win its independence from the North, it would be doing it on its own.."
Social Studies,But the South had many advantages including very good leadership in the person of Robert E. Lee and also kind of a home court advantage at large since the vast majority of the war was fought in the South. So in this early stage the Confederacy does quite well until we get to Antietam. And Antietam was this first foray by Robert E. Lee in trying to attack the states of the North in Maryland. And after the Battle of Antietam which was the bloodiest day in U.S.
Social Studies,"history, more than 4,000 Americans died on that day, the South was defeated. And that was a major turning point in the war as we've talked about in previous videos in that it led to the Emancipation Proclamation and was kind of the moment at which the nations of Europe cease to consider intervening on the side of the South. So in the next few videos I want to talk about the later stages of the Civil War."
Social Studies,"So we get into 1863 and the South is doing relatively well here in Virginia, wins the Battle of Chancellorsville and now, nearly a year after Antietam in June and July of 1863, Robert E. Lee decides that he is going to try again to invade the North. Now he's several reasons for doing this."
Social Studies,"One, is that the war has been taking place largely in the South so it's summer, people are trying to harvest their crops and Lee wants to give the South a break so he wants to take the attention away from this area in Virginia where lots of fighting has happened and he wants to take the war up into the North. And if the North is distracted by having to defend its own territory then it can't go on the offensive elsewhere as easily."
Social Studies,"So Lee's plan is to take the war to the North and Lee has another reason in his sleeve which is that he is really hoping that in the Election of 1864 which is coming up not too long after this period in mid-1863, many people believe that Lincoln is going to be kicked out of office. Now remember, that not a single American President has been elected to a second term or reelected since Andrew Jackson in 1832. So there's been a 30 year drought of two term presidents. So Robert E."
Social Studies,"Lee has good reason to expect why Lincoln might not be reelected in 1864 and he thinks that maybe one of Lincoln's competitors in the Democratic Party, which will turn out to be one of his own former generals, George B. McClellan will actually want to end the war and make peace with the South. So there's kind of a morale aspect to this. You can see that many of the things done in the Civil War and especially as we get into the later stages are designed at making one side or the other tired of being at war."
Social Studies,"Now you may wonder why I'm spending so much time talking about battles because most American History courses do not emphasize military history whatsoever. But I think it's important to keep in mind in this war and in some earlier wars like the American Revolution the battles really determine the policy, right, because you can't make a decree like the way that Abraham Lincoln decreed the Emancipation Proclamation if you don't have the force of military power behind you."
Social Studies,"So winning battles, winning the war, those kind of victories give politicians the popular mandate they need to get things done. So that's why I think that it's important to talk, at least a little bit, about the battles of the Civil War."
Social Studies,"Now obviously, Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox were not the only battles of the Civil War, there were hundreds of battles of the Civil War but I've chosen these as particular turning points just to kind of give you a very brief overview of the way that military victories and defeats were trending. Because along with those military victories and defeats went the policy of the United States and the policy of the South."
Social Studies,"And if you're interested in the Civil War it's one of the most written about topics in American history and there are many wonderful books that will go into great detail about the politics, society, and military history of the Civil War, and lots of great television shows, and miniseries that I definitely suggest that you check out. All right, well, with that said let's talk about Gettysburg."
Social Studies,"So Lee has brought his forces into the North and, again, he's interested in kind of distracting the North from attacking in the South by bringing the war to them. He's hoping to prolong the war so that perhaps another administration that's more favorable to allowing the South to go peacefully might be in office in the North."
Social Studies,"And the other thing that he's looking for is supplies so once again the vast majority of the Civil War has been fought in the South and it's been fought here in this sort of Shenandoah Valley, Tidewater region of Virginia which is really the breadbasket of the South. So when men are out fighting battles and when battles are being fought on fields instead of crops being grown on them, there's going to be a serious dearth of food in the South."
Social Studies,You know I once heard it said that the most salient political fact of the 20th century was that the Americans speak English which means that the United States repeatedly allied with Britain in 20th century wars. But if I had to choose the most salient fact of the American Civil War it might be that you can't eat cotton. You know the South went to war to protect its system of labor so that it could continue to produce these cash crops like cotton or tobacco.
Social Studies,And cash crops they may be which means that you can sell them for money but you can't eat cotton or tobacco. And when it comes down to it being able to feed your troops and feed your populace is something that's going to really help you when it comes to winning a war. So Lee is taking his troops up into the North and he takes them into Southern Pennsylvania which is very lovely farmland.
Social Studies,"It's a very beautiful place if you've never been there, I absolutely recommend you take a look, go to Gettysburg it's a very well preserved battlefield. And as Lee goes through Southern Pennsylvania his troops are taking horses, and grain supplies, and all sorts of things that the army needs to survive which are in short supply in Virginia. So this is like a run to the store for Lee going through Southern Pennsylvania."
Social Studies,"On the Northern side, General George Meade has been trying to catch up with Lee and cut him off from his invasion of the North. President Abraham Lincoln asks for many volunteers to try to stave off the invasion of the North by Lee and they end up meeting at Gettysburg. And Gettysburg is just a small farm town in Southern Pennsylvania, it's just where these two troops happen to meet as Lee was on his way to the capital of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg and Lee's forces and Meade's forces meet on July 1st, 1863."
Social Studies,"Now the Battle of Gettysburg goes on for three days so there's July 1st, July 2nd, and July 3rd. And the first day goes relatively well for the Confederates, they break some of the Union lines around the edges. The second day is kind of a stalemate where Northern forces and Southern forces, they sustain a lot of losses but don't make any real headway toward victory."
Social Studies,"And then the third day, Lee decides that he is going to try to break the center of the Union forces which means that he is going to try to hit the Union line, and remember this is in the era of military history where people are still kind of fighting in lines, right through the center, and win the day. Unfortunately for him that is not what happens so he tries all day to break the Union lines."
Social Studies,There's a very famous sort of last hurrah for the Southern forces in this called Pickett's Charge when General George Pickett's units charge up this hill at Cemetery Ridge trying to break the line and they sustain over 50% casualties so it's kind of a bloodbath for Pickett's unit.
Social Studies,And after Pickett's Charge does not succeed the Union forces have officially won the Battle of Gettysburg and Lee realizes that there's no way that he's going to be able to make anything out of his invasion of the North and so he turns around and starts heading back to the South. Now what's important about Gettysburg is that this was what many have called the High Water Mark of the Confederacy.
Social Studies,"And by that they mean this is as far as the Confederacy ever managed to get into the Northern part of the United States. This is a second attempt at an invasion by Lee and it failed and many people see this as a really important turning point in the Civil War on July 4th. And imagine the good news of receiving word that your troops had triumphed on July 4th, Independence Day. President Lincoln and the United States get another really good piece of news which is that Ulysses S."
Social Studies,Grant who will be the future commander of U.S. forces has succeeded in his siege of Vicksburg which is a town on the Mississippi River. And when he takes the town on the Mississippi River Grant has complete control of the Mississippi which is sort of the major highway in the West. So July 3rd and July 4th are really good days for the United States and this is kind of the moment when it becomes clear that victory is going to be outside the reach of the Confederacy.
Social Studies,"And with an unsuccessful invasion of the North and the loss of the control of the Mississippi, the South's time is kind of coming to an end. The other important thing about the Battle of Gettysburg is that it is a tremendously destructive battle, about 50,000 casualties took place at Gettysburg which makes it the single bloodiest battle in American history which is different from the single bloodiest day which was at Antietam because it took place over three days."
Social Studies,"And this is not 50,000 people dying, just 50,000 casualties which means either deaths or injuries, those are men who can no longer fight on both sides. So the tremendous loss of life at Gettysburg is going to lead to the foundation of a cemetery at Gettysburg to bury these military dead."
Social Studies,"And it's going to be in November of 1863, just a couple of months after the Battle of Gettysburg, that Abraham Lincoln will visit the cemetery at Gettysburg and deliver the Gettysburg Address, one of the most famous orations in all of American history and we'll get to that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"Gettysburg was the most destructive battle of the Civil War, there were about 50,000 casualties, and it, along with the victory of The Siege of Vicksburg, which followed the day after, on July 4th, really start to signify the beginning of the end of the Confederacy's bid for independence."
Social Studies,"Now, what you may not know about The Battle of Gettysburg, is that is was almost the end of the war, in fact, Lee took his army, trying to cross back over the Potomac into the South, and the Potomac was flooded so, he and his army were pretty much pinned, between this flooded river, and the forces of Meade in the North."
Social Studies,"Now Meade, if he had attacked, probably could've won the war right there and then, and Lincoln was so angry that Meade didn't attack, he wrote him this really nasty letter saying, ""I think you don't even realize what you've done here by letting Lee get away, we could've ended the war right now"", but actually Lincoln didn't send that letter, he thought better of it, and instead congratulated Meade on his great victory and, the boost of morale that it gave the forces of the United States, at Gettysburg."
Social Studies,"So now I'd like to take some time to talk about The Gettysburg Address, which is arguably, the most famous speech in American History, it's pretty up there. And it's extremely short, it's only 272 words. Now Lincoln delivered The Gettysburg Address, on November 19th, 1863. So it's about three and a half months after The Battle of Gettysburg."
Social Studies,"I think The Gettysburg Address is really interesting, and all of the events surrounding it, the circumstances surrounding it, tell us a lot about the culture and society of the 19th Century, the progress of the Civil War, and also the way that things are going to kind of be wrapped up in the end of the Civil War. What the ultimate message of the war is going to be, and what the blueprint of reuniting the country is going to look like."
Social Studies,"So Gettysburg was this tremendously destructive battle with 50,000 casualties. And remember that, after the battle, Lee is kinda fleeing for the life of his army. And not too long after that, Meade pursues him. So the Armies make kind of an incredible mess, and then they take off, leaving this tiny town of Gettysburg, which has I think about 2,500 people, to deal with 50,000 casualties. So men who are dead, or wounded, maybe missing in action somewhere."
Social Studies,"And they really just don't have the capacity for it, so the Governor of Pennsylvania, contracts out to create a cemetery. And in this period of three and a half months, there are bodies literally rotting on the ground, so it's a bit of a hellscape, the entire town of Gettysburg stinks, they had to burn all the dead horses, so it smells like burning horses, and rotting human flesh. It is not a happy place to be."
Social Studies,"So the town of Gettysburg and the State of Pennsylvania, are very eager to get a cemetery underway at Gettysburg. And so they begin the process of burying the bodies, and re-burying the bodies, trying to identify the various corpses that are left on the fields. And they ask this man, Edward Everett, who is really the Preeminent Orator of his day. He was like the rock concert of the 19th Century, to come and give an Oration on the Dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery."
Social Studies,"And they say, ""Everett, do you think you can do this on October 23rd?"" And Everett says, ""No, I definitely won't be ready to have a script for an Oration by then, so can you push it back to November 19th?"" So, it's actually Everett who decides, what day The Gettysburg Address is going to take place on. Lincoln, by contrast, was only invited maybe a month or so before, and he wasn't really considered the important speaker of the day, that was Everett."
Social Studies,"But Lincoln knew, that he wanted to make something of his remarks at Gettysburg."
Social Studies,"Now remember that, an election year is coming up in 1864, it's been a hard year, Gettysburg is the first major victory that the United States forces have had in a long time, so he kinda wants to make sure that he can set the tone of how Gettysburg is going to be remembered, and to reconfirm a sense of mission, about the Civil War right, when there's been such a great loss of life, and when you're standing around looking at that loss of life, it can be very easy to get discouraged and say, okay, maybe we should just end the war, we should have peace now, allow the South to secede and, retain slavery, and Lincoln wants to make sure that people come away from this Dedication at Gettysburg, with a renewed sense of purpose, in continuing to fight the Civil War."
Social Studies,"Now there's a common misconception that, Lincoln wrote The Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope on the train to Gettysburg. That is almost certainly not the case, because Lincoln was a planner. Remember that he was self-educated, and he always took a lot of time in anything that he wrote. He wrote drafts and got revisions and, wrote yet another draft."
Social Studies,"He liked to be extremely precise with his language, and you can see that throughout pretty much everything that he's written, that he is an extremely effective and eloquent writer. And that wasn't just because he was an extremely eloquent person, he was. That's cuz he worked really hard at it. So we're fairly certain, that Lincoln spent some time drafting The Gettysburg Address in The White House, long before he left."
Social Studies,"So, the day arrives, November 19th, 1863, and Everett gets set up in a tent, cuz he's the real headliner of the day. Now Edward Everett was I think, the undisputed champion of giving speeches in his day. He was an incredible speaker, and everyone who was there, actually agreed that, Everett did an incredible job speaking, he spoke for over two hours, and if that sounds like a really long time to us, for the 19th Century that was actually pretty appropriate."
Social Studies,"That's what people expected out of Oratory, in the 19th Century. They paid attention, they were riveted by it. It was like going to see a movie or a concert today. So people really wanted to hear Everett talk for that long. In fact, they were quite confused, when Lincoln didn't talk for longer then just a couple of minutes."
Social Studies,"A lot of people even were reported to say, ""Was that it?"" So here in the center we have a picture of the day at Gettysburg and, we're pretty sure that this is the only confirmed picture of Lincoln at Gettysburg. Now, he's kinda small here, but I think this is a really interesting picture, cuz it gives you a sense of what Lincoln's stature was at the time, and also the people that he surrounded himself with."
Social Studies,"So, this is Lincoln here, right here in the center, not wearing a hat, looking down, and then he's surrounded by the important people of his cabinet, so right here, I'm pretty sure this is William Seward, who was the Secretary of State, and over here, these are John Hay and John Nicolay who were Lincoln's Personal Secretaries. They went everywhere with him, and this guy up here is a little harder to see, that is Edward Everett."
Social Studies,"Now imagine what it would have been like, to stand on this field, in this growing cemetery at Gettysburg, and listen to Edward Everett, and Abraham Lincoln talk about the meaning of the battle around you. Now remember, that it's November, so it's been three and a half months since the battle, but The Battle of Gettysburg took place, in the beginning of July, and it was 90, 100 degrees outside, so when Lee and Meade left Gettysburg, they left 8,000 or more bodies, rotting in the hot July sun."
Social Studies,"And many of them had been out there rotting, for those three months so, when you were standing on this field at Gettysburg, there would have literally been human bones around you, that you could see."
Social Studies,"It probably would have still smelled pretty terrible, so you're really kind of in the thick of the destruction of the Civil War, and listening to these two men, who are trying to make meaning out of it for you, so Everett gets up, and he gives this fiery speech for two hours, and he goes through all of the details of the battle and says, ""This is what happened over on that hill, and this is what happened over on that hill"", and he tries to rev up the crowd into kind of this patriotic fervor, of not only appreciating the glory of The Union Victory at Gettysburg, but also renewing their hatred for their enemy, and then Lincoln gets up to speak, and he speaks for just a couple minutes, and we'll talk more about that, in the next video.."
Social Studies,"- [Kimberly] Gettysburg is in the third year of the U.S. Civil War, which started in 1861 when southern states seceded to protect slavery. - [Steven] And Gettysburg is a little town that happened to be the place where the U.S. army confronted the Confederate General Lee's second attempt to invade the North. - [Kimberly] And this battle is a turning point. Things had not been going well for the U.S. army. There's some talk about maybe making peace and allowing the southern states to go their own way."
Social Studies,"The Southerners are hoping that they'll get international recognition from England and from France that they can continue as a separate country. They make this invasion of the North to try to end the war. This battle takes place over three days from July 1 through 3, 1863. It is the battle with the single highest number of casualties in the entire Civil War. News of the victory of U.S. troops gets to Washington, DC, the capital, on the afternoon of July 4, 1863."
Social Studies,"So, Independence Day turns into this enormous celebration of an important victory. - [Steven] When we think about victory in the history of art, what comes to mind are triumphant images with flags waving. What we're seeing here is something very different. - [Kimberly] It really turns the whole notion of a history painting of a great battle on its head. We don't have ""Liberty Leading the People"" here; we don't have Napoleon on horseback."
Social Studies,"What we have are some dead bodies that have been out in the heat and rain for a number of days. You see that the men laying here have lost their shoes, pockets are turned inside out, belongings scattered around them. There've been battlefield scavengers who have come and taken their shoes, taken perhaps money in their pockets. - [Steven] This is not a random image. The photographer found a perspective that met his criteria."
Social Studies,"- [Kimberly] O'Sullivan and Gardner thought of themselves as artists and did not hesitate to set the scene or even add props to make the narrative of the photographs more interesting. - [Steven] And we know that in certain cases, the photographer and his assistants would actually move bodies and some of the debris of the battlefield in order to create a more perfect image. We don't know if that's the case here. In 1863, photography was an extremely deliberate process. This is a wet collodion print."
Social Studies,"The process was a difficult one and required very heavy equipment that had to be brought onto the battlefield- in this case, in a wagon with multiple people working together. This was a very time-sensitive, very labor-intensive process. - [Kimberly] When news of the battle came to Washington, DC, you would have had Alexander Gardner, who was one of the foremost photographers of his era, gather his operators- among them, Timothy O'Sullivan- get into a wagon. They're delayed by rain."
Social Studies,It takes them a couple days to get to Gettysburg and then it's a three-man process. And remember that not only has it been raining and it's muddy but thousands of bodies are decomposing. The battle also led to the death of thousands of horses whose carcasses were put in piles and burned. Gardner and his operators would have smeared peppermint oil underneath their noses so that they could bear just how it smelled to stand there. This would have been very unpleasant work.
Social Studies,"- [Steven] Battlefield photography was new. There had been photographs taken during the Mexican-American War and the very first battlefield photographs were taken during the Crimean War. And so, it was extremely novel to see images like this. We have empty grass in the immediate foreground that allows our eye to enter into the scene. We're stopped, though, almost immediately by this horizontal line of bodies- most forcefully by a man whose mouth is open, whose body is bloated."
Social Studies,"Our eye then moves across and we see bodies set up in a line moving away from our eye, setting up a kind of measured recession. Once we've reached that further point, we see another line of bodies and debris, a man on horseback, a man standing beside what might be a wagon. Beyond that, a distant hill. And lost in mist or perhaps smoke, trees and hills. The hills dip and create almost a vanishing point."
Social Studies,"And so, whether or not by chance or by design, this is a photograph- for all of its horror- that is still following the formulas of landscape painting that have come down to us from the Renaissance. - [Kimberly] These bodies of U.S. soldiers would shortly be interred and after that moved into a cemetery for those who fell. And it's at the dedication for that cemetery that Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States, delivered his Gettysburg Address."
Social Studies,That address tried to draw a relationship between the people who died at Gettysburg and the great cause for which the United States was fighting.
Social Studies,"He said, ""From these honored dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth."" This famous photograph tells us so much about death and sacrifice during the Civil War. (jazzy piano music)."
Social Studies,"But, somehow, the 272 words that Lincoln says here in the Gettysburg Address has become one of the most famous and important pieces of rhetoric in American history. So, in this video, I'd like to just take a little time to read the Gettysburg Address and to interpret it, line by line, to give a better sense of what it's trying to say and why it's so important. All right, so let's see if I can do this justice."
Social Studies,"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live."
Social Studies,"It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here."
Social Studies,"It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced."
Social Studies,"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us: that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. Wow, it gives me chills just reading this."
Social Studies,"And there's just something about Lincoln's oratory, the way that he puts things, that just rivets you, and this is why he was such a great leader and such a great politician. Because, he knew how to use words to his advantage. And he knew how to touch people with what he had to say. Now, it's more than 150 years later and we still read this and memorize it in school and think about it on kind of a regular basis, because we frequently quote the words the he said here."
Social Studies,"So, how did this get to be so important? Well, let's read it line by line and see what he's really saying. All right, so, Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. All right, well, this in case you're wondering, means 87 years. Four score, a score is 20."
Social Studies,"In fact, some of the newspapers that printed the text of this speech, just said 87 years ago, So, why doesn't Lincoln just say 87? Well, I think this fourscore and seven years ago has this really strong, I would even say Biblical ring, right? It has this importance and eloquence of oratory. So, he's already setting the tone to say here, in this nation, we are measuring time almost Biblicaly. Like this is a sacred mission, and it's been a sacred amount of time since the founding of the nation."
Social Studies,"And I think it's really interesting to note that it's only 87 years between 1776 and 1863. I know this is just basic math, but between the founding of the United States and the Civil War, when the union fought for its very survival, was less than 100 years. It's a very short period of time. Now, Lincoln as a young man, would have known older men who had fought in the Revolutionary War, Andrew Jackson for example."
Social Studies,"So, Lincoln starts out by saying that less than 100 years ago, the United States was founded and it was founded on this principle, that all men are created equal. Now, if you contrast this with the system of slavery, which the South is fighting to preserve, that is definitely in contradistinction to the concept that all men are created equal. So, Lincoln reminds his audience immediately that the founding principles of the United States were equality and liberty."
Social Studies,"All right, so he moves on to say Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. So in less than 100 years the idea that held the United States together is now being tested, and he's reminding people that the world is watching."
Social Studies,"They're saying, all right, there's this upstart democracy in the Americas saying that monarchy, which has been the rule of Europe for more than 1000 years is a silly proposition and they can do better. Well, now look at them. They're fighting a civil war because some folks want to be the masters of others and some folks don't think that's all right. So, in a way, what Lincoln is reminding people here is that they're engaged in this grand experiment."
Social Studies,"Right, this grand experiment of liberty and equality, where no one is the master of anyone else, where any person, like Abraham Lincoln, born in a log cabin, less than a year of school in his entire life can become president. So, if the democracy of the United States fails, if this union falls apart, then it will have proved the doubters right, that democracy doesn't work. And then he continues: We are met on a great battle-field of that war."
Social Studies,"We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. I think there are two important things here. So, he talks about the concept of a nation."
Social Studies,"And this is really interesting because prior to the civil war, it was frequent that people might say things like these United States right? The idea that the states are the most prominent portion of the country and that the individual states plural, were together in a union that was secondary to the idea of statehood. But, midway through the war, Lincoln starts to use the word nation more and more. And afterwards, it will always be known as The United States."
Social Studies,"So, Lincoln is signaling here that this is one united nation, not just a collection of states and that is what the American forces are fighting for. That is what the forces of the United States are trying to achieve, a united nation, not a united set of states. The other interesting thing here is that he mentions it's altogether fitting and proper that we should do this."
Social Studies,"Why wouldn't it be proper to dedicate a cemetery? Well, a lot of people thought that it wasn't proper for Lincoln to be speaking at this ceremony dedication. They thought that it was kind of a cheap political maneuvering. Imagine today if the president went to a soldier's funeral. Many people might say it's not appropriate for the president to be there because it's just a political opportunity, right? That you're trying to get votes from somebody else's tragedy."
Social Studies,"And it's kind of ironic, because Lincoln's speech here is very sacred, very funereal, whereas Everett's speech was very political, saying this was a great battle, we have to remember that the Confederates are our enemies. But Lincoln's speech is much gentler, much kinder, much more appropriate actually to a funeral perhaps than Everett's speech."
Social Studies,"But, he feels it necessary to remind people that it is appropriate to gather here together to mark the dedication of this cemetery even though many might decry it as just political grandstanding. Now, I think it's this next paragraph that makes the Gettysburg Address so powerful. So, let's read it. In a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract."
Social Studies,"The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here. So, he's drawing attention to the importance of the battlefield dead. He says this is not about us. It's about them. They have sacrificed. They have become martyrs for this cause, so we can not consecrate the cemetery, they have already consecrated it with their blood and with their sacrifice. So, he's reminding everyone of the sacrifice and the martyrdom of the battlefield dead."
Social Studies,"Now, here's the real power of the Gettysburg Address. The last couple of sentences. Let's read them all together. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced."
Social Studies,"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
Social Studies,"Well, what Lincoln does here is so powerful because it's kind of a rhetorical switcher-roo. He says we're not here to dedicate the cemetery. The cemetery is here to dedicate us. Men have died here and we must honor their martyrdom. We must honor their sacrifice for the experiment of liberty and equality by taking renewed dedication to that cause. So, come to the battlefield of Gettysburg."
Social Studies,"Come to this cemetery and take renewed heart in the mission of continuing democracy, continuing equality and continuing to fight for a United States of America. And how the rest of those battles play out, we'll get to in the next video.."
Social Studies,"The Anaconda is a kind of snake that squeezes its victims, so the plan of the North was gonna be to squeeze the South by completely surrounding it and then not allowing anything to get in or out. So, the South would have no choice but to surrender as they ran out of supplies. So, the Anaconda Plan is going fairly well in this late period of the war."
Social Studies,"So, now you recall that they were going to blockade the Atlantic Ocean so that the South couldn't ship any of its cotton or receive any supplies from Europe, so that's not happening, and, to take control of the Mississippi River, which goes here, doo, doo, doo. So, the other reason why Abraham Lincoln was so happy after the North won the Battle of Gettysburg is because Ulysses S."
Social Studies,"Grant had just taken Vicksburg, which meant that the Union had control of the Mississippi River, so you can see that the plan to surround the South is going pretty well. This blockade extended all the way down around Florida. The last real area here that the Union needs to control is this sort of middle region here."
Social Studies,"You know that these are the border states, so there's still slavery allowed in places like Kentucky and Tennessee and Maryland, and another thing that's kind of hard to see from this map is that there are mountains here. This is the Appalachian Mountain Range, and so this is gonna be a difficult area to strategize through. So, thanks to this mountain range, there are two real main theaters of war during the Civil War."
Social Studies,"There's the Eastern Theater of the war, which is over here, and that includes a lot of the battles that are gonna take place in the Shenandoah Valley area of Virginia, and through Georgia, so kind of the tidewater Piedmont region of the East is one of the main areas where battle takes place during this Civil War. But the other theater is this Western Theater, and that includes the Mississippi River and these key border states of Kentucky and Tennessee."
Social Studies,"When last we left off with the Battle of Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee, who's the commander of the Armies for the Confederacy had made an attempt to invade the North and got as far as southern Pennsylvania where the Union troops led by General George Meade turned the Confederates away and so now, they're headed back to Virginia. There's gonna be some really fierce fighting here in this northern part of Virginia known as the Wilderness Campaign as Lee retreats to Richmond."
Social Studies,"That's the Eastern Theater, and I'll draw the blue line that's gonna be following them here as well. Now in the Western Theater of the war, Ulysses S. Grant has just provided a major victory by taking Vicksburg, and now controlling all of the Mississippi River."
Social Studies,"Abraham Lincoln has been looking for a great general to lead his armies, Now, Lee has been the commander of the Confederate armies this entire time, but the Union army has had a multitude of commanders from Winfield Scott to George McClellan, but in Ulysses S. Grant, Lincoln finally finds his general. So, after the victory at the Siege of Vicksburg, Grant goes up into Tennessee and finally captures Tennessee. He takes Chattanooga and firmly puts Tennessee in control of the Union."
Social Studies,"So, look how well the Anaconda strategy is going now. We've got Tennessee, we're almost there. After taking Chattanooga, Lincoln makes Grant the commander of all the Union armies. He is the General in Chief, and it's going to be Grant who ultimately leads the Union to victory and when he meets up with Lee, as he will do once he heads to Richmond and then later Appomattox, he's going to be the one who really ends the war by forcing Lee's surrender. But we'll get to that."
Social Studies,"So that's 1863, the period at which Grant becomes Commander of the Armies, Lee is turned away from his second invasion of the north and flees to Richmond, and the stage is set for the final year, and little bit more of the war, which we'll get to in the next video.."
Social Studies,So now let's move on and talk about 1864 and Sherman's March of the Sea and the election of 1864. Both would be very important to the United States victory. All right so let's take a look at our map again. Now as we recall Lee is here in Richmond and Grant who was in Tennessee now coming over to challenge Lee at the siege of Richmond. So Grant has crossed over from the Western theater of the war where he's been pretty much the entire time into the Eastern theater and he's going for the killing blow now.
Social Studies,"You're remember that thanks to the Anaconda strategy the union now has control of the entire area of the South through a blockade on this side, control of the Mississippi and now control of Tennessee. So there's just this litte area that's left. So now what happens? Well one of Grants generals who served under him in this Tennessee campaign is now going to turn his attention to a massive campaign of total war in the south."
Social Studies,"So this is William Tecumseh Sherman and Sherman's idea is that he is going to cut a swath through the South and he is going to try to destroy the South's morale by not only trying to get rid of food stuffs and interrupt supply lines, destroy infrastructure, burn houses. He's gonna make things so bad on the home front that the Confederate soldiers who are fighting up here with Lee are gonna get upset that their property and their families are not being protected at home."
Social Studies,So he's trying to win a morale victory by making people in the South really tired of being at war and also by making Lee's soldiers want to desert and come back and defend their home territory. So Sherman turns his troops toward Atlanta and in September of 1864 Sherman takes Atlanta. There's a very famous scene of this in Gone with the Wind where you see Scarlet O'Hara looking out over the many injured people in the city of Atlanta. That's Sherman's doing.
Social Studies,But now let's turn attention away from the military campaigns for a second and talk about the politics of 1864. Now in 1864 it's an election year. It's been four years since Lincoln was elected in November of 1860 so now Lincoln has to stand for reelection. And this is a really interesting election for lots of reasons. One is that it's the first election during wartime since 1812.
Social Studies,"So in the election of 1864 soldiers are going to cast their ballots either by getting short leaves to go to the ballot box or by sending in their ballots by mail. Another thing that's really interesting about this is that Lincoln is not at all sure that he's going to win this election. In fact many in his own party, the Republican Party, feel that he's been considerably too soft on the south, that his plans for reunification are not nearly punitive enough."
Social Studies,There are many who want to replace Lincoln with a more radical candidate in 1864 but that does not end up happening. But one interesting thing that does end up happening is to try to increase Lincoln's appeal his running mate is Andrew Johnson.
Social Studies,"Johnson was a slaveholder, believe it or not from Tennessee and the idea was that maybe Johnson could pick up some of the Democrats who might necessarily have voted for McClellan and maybe he could pick up some of the border states the same way that we often might choose a vice president today because they come from a crucial swing state."
Social Studies,And this is gonna be important later because after Lincoln is assassinated Andrew Johnson will take over as president and he is quite a different president then Lincoln might have been in the circumstances. Now on the Democratic side the candidate is George McClellan. You might remember McClellan because he was one of the first commanders of the Union army and Lincoln sent him down for failing to really go after the enemy strongly in the early stages of the war.
Social Studies,"Now the Democratic Party is having some internal struggles at this point. There are some who think that the war against the South is very foolish, that no one should be fighting in the north to end slavery which Lincoln has clearly made a war goal by this point. So many just wish to have peace with the South on the terms of the South which is as a separate nation with the continuation of slavery. And then there are those Democrats who would like to continue the war and McClellan ends up being one of those."
Social Studies,"Obviously being a general, it would have been pretty difficult for him to say that the war was pointless without having disappointed so many people who had fought for him or with him. This election is really crucial because many in the South are hoping that if someone other than Lincoln gets elected, if the Democrats are elected, that is gonna be their last best hope to try to achieve their independence from the union."
Social Studies,"If Lincoln is replaced by someone who is pro-South, who is pro-slavery then perhaps they'll just end the war and that would be the end of it. So whites the South are really holding on to the idea that Lincoln will be defeated in 1864. And there are a lot of reasons to think that Lincoln might have been defeated in this. Lincoln himself was not very sure that he will win this election. Remember that there has not a single American president who has been reelected in more than 30 years."
Social Studies,The last president to be reelected was Andrew Jackson in 1832. So reelection is very a unusual thing at this point and McClellan was a very popular general. He got popular because he was very keen to spare the lives of his soldiers which is quite different from the approach that Ulysses S. Grant will end up taking at the end of the war. But there are several things that go in Lincolns' favor.
Social Studies,One is the capture of Atlanta by Sherman in September and some very good military victories also in this eastern theater of the war. So McClellan who had hoped that the war was going badly didn't have much on his side when it actually came to election day 'cause at that point the war was going pretty well. Remember that Sherman is here in Atlanta and Sherman is now going to pick up what is known as his March to the Sea when he cuts a 60 mile wide swath of destruction through Georgia.
Social Studies,"So things are looking pretty good for the United States at this point. And the turning point for Lincoln in this election is really the votes of the soldiers and they have a really strong pro-Lincoln mandate. One of Lincoln's campaign slogan is Vote As You Shot. So Lincoln ends up trouncing McClellan in the election of 1864 and he really comes away with a strong mandate to finish the war, finish it with an unconditional surrender of the South and the end of slavery."
Social Studies,"And having triumpthed in the election of 1864 Lincoln it gets even more good news from Georgia which is a telegram from General Sherman from the city of Savannah saying Mr. President, I wish to offer you the city of Savannah as a Christmas present. So in December 25, 1864 Sherman's March to the Sea has concluded. And from there he's going to start heading north. And we'll get to that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"So let's move on to 1865. A lot happens very quickly in 1865, starting with, in January, Congress passed the 13th Amendment. The 13th Amendment outlawed slavery for all time. It's clear that when the south is brought back in to the United States, it is going to be brought back in without slavery, there is no option for slavery in the United States going forward. Now Grant, after his incredible victory in Tennessee, in Vicksburg, has been going after Lee's army in Virginia."
Social Studies,"Now Lee has holed up in Richmond and eventually, he realizes his forces can't stay there anymore, they can't hold the city, so in the beginning of April, they evacuate Richmond and on April 3rd, the United States forces occupy Richmond. Abraham Lincoln himself actually goes down to visit Richmond, which he'd never been to before, and he even goes to the government building in Richmond where Confederate President Jefferson Davis had governed, and goes into his office."
Social Studies,"He's there less than 48 hours after Davis himself had left. And then events, after that, events take place very quickly. So Lee falls back from Richmond to Petersburg, and Grant is kind of marking him the whole time, and they retreat across Virginia to the west, Lee is probably heading for Lynchburg, and Grant manages to catch up with him at Appomattox."
Social Studies,"At first, Lee thinks that he's actually going to fight at Appomattox, and then he realizes he just does not have the men necessary, so he invites Grant to come and have a parlay for surrender, and they meet, this is actually a picture of Lee outside the house in Appomattox courthouse, Virginia, where he surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant."
Social Studies,"Now that is not the actual end of the Civil War, but it's kind of the end for all intents and purposes because Lee is the General-in-Chief of the Confederate Armies. Grant is likewise for the United States. And after this point, it's just gonna be kind of a matter of time until all the rest of the Confederate armies surrender."
Social Studies,"So there's great celebration in Washington, D.C., everyone is very happy, finally this four year long war, where 620,000 Americans have died, is over, and Abraham Lincoln goes and gives a speech, talking about what Reconstruction is going to be like. And in this speech, he lays out that African Americans, after the Civil War, are going to have citizenship, at least some of them, and the right to vote, which is in keeping with everything that he's really said since the Emancipation Proclamation."
Social Studies,"But what he does not know, is that this man, John Wilkes Booth, is in the crowd that day, listening to him, and when he hears Lincoln say that African Americans are gonna have citizenship, they're gonna have the right to vote, he vows to kill Lincoln. John Wilkes Booth is really interesting character, we only know so much about him."
Social Studies,"He himself was a famous actor, in fact, Lincoln had seen him perform a number of times, and liked him, even invited him to the White House, cause he thought he was a great actor, but Booth refused to go and see Lincoln. And he was from a family of famous actors, I think kind of a modern-day equivalent might be the Sheen family. Booth had a famous brother who was also an actor, and a famous father who was also an actor, just like Martin Sheen's sons are Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen today."
Social Studies,"So this would be like, if Emilio Estevez or Charlie Sheen suddenly decided to murder the President, which would be a pretty incredibly big deal, just as it was then. Booth was a Confederate sympathizer, and almost certainly a Confederate spy who had gone up to Canada at some time to plot some movement on behalf of the Confederacy. He was an outright racist, I think the part where Lincoln said African Americans would have citizenship was what pushed him over the edge into assassinating Lincoln."
Social Studies,"Originally he had actually planned to kidnap Lincoln, and ransom him for the end of the Civil War, but after Lee surrenders, Booth's plan changes. He wants to basically decapitate the government, so he conspires with a couple of other people, and they plan that they're going to kill all the highest people in government at once."
Social Studies,"So they're going to kill Lincoln, they're going to kill General Grant, they're going to kill William Seward, the secretary of state, and they're going to kill Andrew Johnson, the Vice-President. And Booth thinks that perhaps, in this moment of panic that follows the decapitation of the entire United States government, that perhaps something positive for the south with happen."
Social Studies,"Remember, they had hoped that getting rid of Lincoln in the election of 1864 might result in putting a government more favorable to the south in office to the north, which didn't happen, so perhaps Booth wants to do the same thing this time. So Booth reads in the newspaper that Abraham Lincoln is going to be attending a play at Ford's Theater that evening. And Booth is a regular at Ford's Theater, in fact, he even has his mail delivered there, so it's kind of his home away from home."
Social Studies,"And when Booth goes to the theater with the intent to kill Lincoln, he pretty much just goes up to Lincoln's box, and everyone knows who he is, and they say hi John, and he just walks on by, walks right into Lincoln's box, shuts the door behind him, and shoots Lincoln through the back of the head. At that point, he jumped on the stage from the booth, which is maybe 14 feet above the stage."
Social Studies,"If you've never been to Ford's Theater and you have an opportunity, I highly recommend you go, it's a really interesting museum and historical place, and in the process, he actually breaks his ankle, so in his running away he's dealing with this broken ankle and eventually he is captured, and refuses to be taken alive, so he is killed. And later the rest of the conspirators are hanged for their participation in this plot. There's some confusion over what Booth said when he jumped out of the box."
Social Studies,"A lot of people say that he yelled sic semper tyrannis, which means, thus always to tyrants, and is also the motto of the state of Virginia. Other people heard him say things like I've done it, or revenge for the south, but sic semper tyrannis is kind of the famous phrase that has come out of this. So Booth is calling Lincoln a tyrant, and tyrants are eventually always assassinated. The rest of the assassination plot from that evening mostly failed."
Social Studies,"One of the conspirators, Lewis Powell, did manage to get in to William Seward's house and stab him, he did not succeed in killing him, but he did wound Seward very badly. The rest of the assassination plots did not come to fruition whatsoever. One thing you'll notice is that only a few parts of the Confederate Army have actually surrendered at the time of Lincoln's assassination."
Social Studies,"So the war is, in some cases, still ongoing, particularly in North Carolina, in Raleigh and Durham, where Sherman's forces have come up through South Carolina and North Carolina to meet the forces of Confederate General Joe Johnston. And it's on April the 26th that Joe Johnston surrenders to William Tecumseh Sherman. From that point forward, there are a few dribs and drabs of other armies that are still surrendering."
Social Studies,"Interesting fact, the last Confederate unit to surrender actually surrendered in November of 1865, in Liverpool, England, this was a Confederate ship that had been sailing around, and when they finally came into port, they officially surrendered. Now after Lincoln's assassination, which was an incredible shock to the United States, remember that no President had ever been assassinated before, the power is then transferred to Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's Vice-President."
Social Studies,"And Johnson's Presidency is going to end up being very problematic for a number of reasons, the most important of which being that he's very sympathetic to the south. With Johnson in power as President, he's going to have a considerable amount of conflict with the American Congress, which is dominated by radical Republicans who think that Lincoln himself was not nearly punitive enough toward the south."
Social Studies,"There's going to be just an incredible battle of wills between Congress and Johnson that's going to end with Johnson being the first American President to be impeached. And so thus endeth the Civil War of the United States, with the north victorious. The southern states come back into the Union. The rebellion in the south is defeated, slavery has ended, and the era of states rights is over. In the next video I'd like to talk, just for a few moments, about the big takeaways about the American Civil War."
Social Studies,What is is that makes it so important? And what were the lasting effects? I'll get to that in the next video..
Social Studies,"And Lee surrendered, and then confederate sympathizer and sometimes spy, John Wilkes Booth assassinated American President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln was followed in office by Andrew Johnson, who will preside over reconstruction."
Social Studies,"But now that we've talked about the progress of war, from the first fighting at Fort Sumter in April of 1861, to the last surrenders in November of 1865, I'd like to take just a few minutes to contemplate what some of the bigger issues that the Civil War raises are in American History. And what impact will it have on the future of American life? Well certainly one of the most important things, if not the most important thing to come out of the Civil War is the end of slavery."
Social Studies,"You know, before the Civil War, before the 1850s, your average White American, who lived in say Pennsylvania or Kentucky, probably wasn't very fond of slavery, but probably wouldn't have gone out of his or her way to take a stand against it."
Social Studies,"I think Lincoln himself was very representative of this view, in that, he hated slavery, but he thought that he had no right to interfere with it and he mostly just wanted to make sure that slave owners couldn't bring enslaved people out west to take lands from, what he saw as hardworking, deserving, poorer Whites. By the end of the Civil War, no one could argue that African Americans, especially in the north did not deserve citizenship."
Social Studies,"Throughout the Civil War, African Americans proved their important to the nation, time and time again. Especially through their military service in units like the 54th Massachusetts for example. And so, for the approximately four and a half million enslaved people who lived in the south, they now had their freedom. And the story of what happens to these people who have been freed from bondage, is perhaps the most interesting, and important story of American history."
Social Studies,"Does all men are created equal mean all men and women are created equal? That is the question that will occupy the nation in one way or another, up until the present, really. Another major important takeaway from the Civil War is that that Civil War represented a movement in the United States, from a union of states to a nation. And you can even see how Abraham Lincoln's thinking on this changes over the course of the war. He starts to even use the word nation more and more."
Social Studies,"Throughout the early part of the history of the United States, you see this balance of power between states and between the Federal Government really shifting all of the time. You see things like the nullification crisis in the 1830s when South Carolina said we don't like this tariff. We think that as a state, the union is composed out of the consent of the individual states, and therefore the state has the right to nullify a law it doesn't agree with."
Social Studies,"The same sort of situation happened in 1860 over slavery. The southern states believed that Lincoln would outlaw slavery, and thought that it would be more important to secede as a group of states protecting in their words, their states rights, then to be subject to the laws of the nation. Well the Civil War ends that kind of thinking. In fact you even see it from how people write the name of this country. Frequently it might have been said before the Civil War these United States."
Social Studies,"It's a group of states that are united. After the Civil War, it becomes the United States. One nation, indivisible. And so this is the moment when the Federal Government really begins to grow. You know during war time, the north had to really organize as a nation to provide resources for their populace and for the soldiers and so the President gained powers that he had never had before, and the Federal bureaucracy itself grew a great deal."
Social Studies,"And you're going to see this throughout the 20th century, really up until the 1970s that the Federal Government in the United States is going to have more and more power. A third important takeaway from the Civil War is that during the Civil War the north industrialized to produce all of the goods and material that the north needed to succeed."
Social Studies,"They built factories, and railroads and those factories and railroads, and all the rest of the impressive engineering that went into winning the war is then going to be turned toward making an industrial behemoth in the post war era. So, a lot of things that started during the Civil War in terms of national industrialization really carry on in the post war era, known as the Gilded Age."
Social Studies,"That help the United States become the worlds premiere industrial power, and later, based on that industrial power, one of the worlds premiere political powers. Another thing that is not often talked about with the Civil War is the growing role of women in the United States polity. Ya know in the American Civil War, at first it was very taboo for a woman of good birth to go and become a nurse."
Social Studies,"But as the war progressed, that kind of Victorian thinking, believing that a woman belonged only to a very feminine and domestic sphere of life, really had to fade away in the face of the reality that women needed to play a role in the war. In the north women became nurses. They helped to chair the American Sanitary Commission, which was one of the key hospital groups of the time period."
Social Studies,"And in the south, many women also really took over the running of family farms as White men went away, White women, poorer White women for example would be in charge of a farm themselves. A White woman who belonged to a slave owning family herself, would then have charge of enslaved people. So women took a much more leading role during the Civil War. After the Civil War, some of that falls away."
Social Studies,"In fact, there's a really difficult moment in the movement for women's rights when in 1870, the 15th amendment granted African American men the right to vote, but not women. And so the women's movement will take some time to regroup in the late 19th century. But the Civil War, like many later wars, brought women outside the home. And after the war they were not anxious to go back there. They became involved in many charitable organizations, often known as social housekeeping."
Social Studies,"As women do more and more things outside the home. Which will eventually grow into the women's movement of the early 20th century, and lead to women getting the right to vote. This is just a small sampling of some of the major impacts that the Civil War had on the United States. Often when we think about United States history, we think about it cutting off at the Civil War."
Social Studies,"Most college courses or high school courses are organized the US before the Civil War, and the US after the Civil War, because it's a really defining moment in our nations history for these reasons, and for many others. The United States entered the Civil War a loose union of states divided by territory and beliefs, and exited the Civil War a single nation. Modern, industrial, peopled by an incredibly diverse range of citizens from all over the world."
Social Studies,"In other words, after the Civil War, the United States will really come into its own. And that's because the Civil War was the moment when the United States grew up. The United States in 1870, looked a lot more like the year 1900, then it did the year 1860. The 13th amendment, and later the 14th and 15th amendments ruled that people of African descent were citizens of the United States."
Social Studies,"Remember, beforehand, enslaved people in the south counted for only 3/5ths of a person, and that person couldn't vote, move freely, or own his or her own labor, not to mention their own life. The Civil War decided once and for all that everyone born in the United States was a United States citizen. But what citizenship really meant for African Americans, for women, for Native Americans and immigrants, even for Whites."
Social Studies,"Was still something that would be hammered out through the rest of the 19th century and the 20th. After the Civil War, the old problems of sectional tension and states rights, were put to rest, but they were replaced by new problems. Problems of modern America. Industrialization, poverty, immigration, and so is the guns of the Civil War fell quiet, the United States embarked into a new era, The Gilded Age.."
Social Studies,.
Social Studies,"But that wasn't the majority view. Lincoln's view was that it would require a constitutional amendment to overturn the Dred Scott decision which didn't recognize African Americans as having any legal rights, and to constitionalize equality and that's why the core of the 14th amendment is Section 1, which basically extends to African Americans the same civil rights that white people had taken for granted."
Social Studies,"Well let's read some of that, especially the ""Privileges and Immunities Clause"" read it to us here, what's important there? So the second sentence of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment says ""No state shall make or enforce any law."
Social Studies,.
Social Studies,"Was freedom just the absence of slavery, as most white Southerners believed, or did it imply citizenship, political power, and economic self-sufficiency? Try to solve this dilemma, Congress passed, and the states ratified, three new Constitutional amendments during the Reconstruction era, the 13th Amendment, which ended the system of slavery in 1865, the 14th Amendment, which extended citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States in 1868, and the 15th Amendment, which gave black men the right to vote in 1870."
Social Studies,"So in just five years, African Americans in the South went from personal property to full civic participants, at least in theory. In reality, how different were definitions of freedom, citizenship, and democracy before and after Reconstruction? To really answer this question, we need to examine continuity and change in the Reconstruction era."
Social Studies,"What stayed the same and what changed in each of these three areas following the passage of the Reconstruction Amendments? Okay, first let's look at continuities and changes in the definition of freedom. Before the end of slavery, African Americans had neither economic nor physical freedom. They didn't have control of their bodies or of their labor. The pass system kept them from moving freely, and slavery itself meant that they couldn't choose where to work or earn money from their own work."
Social Studies,"So how much did their physical and economic freedom change after the 13th Amendment outlawed slavery? Well, their economic self-sufficiency went through some ups and downs. Most African Americans believed that their years of unpaid toil entitled them to land of their own."
Social Studies,"US Army general William Tecumseh Sherman redistributed Confederate territory on the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina to black families, who farmed there for a few years until Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, gave all confiscated land back to its former owners. Instead, most black farmers became sharecroppers, renting a portion of a white landowner's farm in exchange for part of the crop yield."
Social Studies,"This gave black farmers a lot more freedom over their own work, since they didn't have to work under an overseer. But economically, sharecropping kept black farmers, as well as small white farmers, in an endless cycle of debt and poverty. After the 13th Amendment, most Southern state governments attempted to limit the physical freedom of African Americans as well, with statutes known as the Black Codes."
Social Studies,"Many of these codes defined anyone who wasn't under a labor contract as a vagrant who could be arrested and have their labor sold. Later, segregation limited the physical freedom of where Southern African Americans could go and what they could do."
Social Studies,"Laws like the Black Codes, which so obviously attempted to institute slavery by another name, led Congress to pass the 14th Amendment, which defined a US citizen as anyone born or naturalized in the United States and specifically prevented states from infringing upon the rights of citizens. Before the Civil War, citizenship was exclusively the privilege of white Americans."
Social Studies,"Non-white immigrants weren't eligible to become US citizens, and the 1857 Supreme Court decision in Dred Scott declared that no African Americans could be citizens at all. The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, led to a huge increase in the number of US citizens and it decoupled citizenship from whiteness. Even the American-born children of Asian immigrants were citizens."
Social Studies,"But the Supreme Court defined the 14th Amendment very narrowly in the late 19th century, permitting many laws that discriminated on the basis of race. Only in the 20th century would the 14th Amendment become an important tool for civil rights activists to break down segregation. Lastly, the 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870, extended the right to vote to black men. In the years leading up to the Civil War, with few exceptions, only white man had the right to vote."
Social Studies,"The 15th Amendment radically redefined the terms of American democracy. During Reconstruction, more than 2,000 African Americans held public office, including two US senators. But there were limits to this new broader definition of democracy. First, it didn't include women, much to the frustration of the women's suffrage movement."
Social Studies,"Then, as the federal government ceased to intervene to protect black citizens in the South in the late 1870s, Southern state governments imposed a range of voter suppression tactics to effectively bar African Americans from voting, which then reduced the likelihood of black politicians winning office. Not until the 1960s would African American voter registration once again reach Reconstruction-era levels."
Social Studies,"So how much did the Reconstruction Amendments change definitions of freedom, citizenship, and democracy? Well, after the amendments, African Americans were free to own their own bodies and labor, but that was about it. The 14th and 15th Amendments led to short-lived revolutions in the concept of citizenship and in voting rights, but those rights had all but evaporated by the end of the century."
Social Studies,"Nevertheless, although they didn't have much of an impact in the short term, these amendments would lay the foundation for the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s.."
Social Studies,"The Civil War is seen as such an enormous turning point in US history that most colleges split courses into US history before 1865 and US history after 1865. But was the United States really that different before and after the Civil War? As historians, we could tackle that question from a lot of different angles. We could look at the role of the federal government in American life before and after the war. We could look at changes in the economy."
Social Studies,"I'm curious about changes in American national identity during this period. What do I mean by national identity? National identity encompasses things like core beliefs about democracy, citizenship, and America's proper role in the world."
Social Studies,"We can identify these beliefs in different time periods by looking at practices like who gets to vote, which groups are defined as a part of the American people versus which groups are defined as aliens or others, and whether the American public is expressing lots of national pride or lots of doubt about the way things are going. So now we've got a historical question that we're curious about."
Social Studies,"If we saw that question like this on an exam it might say something like compare the relative significance of the effects of the Civil War on American values. Okay, well what we're really doing is asking, how much did the Civil War change the core beliefs around American national identity? Did it change some more than others? To answer this question, first we need to decide which core beliefs we want to track. I'm gonna choose ideas around democracy."
Social Studies,"So who gets to vote, whether Americans believe that democracy is something everyone should participate in or just a select few? Second, let's look at ideas around citizenship. Who is defined as an American or as part of the American people and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizenship. Last, let's look at ideas about America's role in the world. Whether or how the United States should be involved in world affairs or extending its influence beyond the boundaries of the United States."
Social Studies,Now you might want to look at different core beliefs than I've chosen here like maybe whether people saw their regional identity as more important than their national identity. And if you want to do that that's totally okay. I'm gonna go with these three themes for now. So let's brainstorm some of the major trends that occur in each of these themes before and after the Civil War in between 1844 and 1877. I've got our timeline here with the big dividing line at the end of the Civil War.
Social Studies,"Now we're looking at this from a bird's eye view of the whole era so I'm not gonna go into much detail about the events we're talking about. If something sounds unfamiliar to you just make a note of it and you can go back to review that concept when you have time. All right, first democracy."
Social Studies,"In the years before the Civil War, what were the prevailing ideas about who should be able to vote and who actually could vote in practice? Well by 1844, most States had extended voting rights to all white men regardless of property ownership, women couldn't vote and neither could enslaved Africans in the South, and voting rights for free African American men in the North were pretty limited."
Social Studies,"How about after the Civil War? Now the biggest change there was the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870 which granted all men the right to vote enfranchising African American men. It did not, to the disappointment of the women's suffrage movement, enfranchise women but by 1877, the end of Reconstruction when the federal government stopped enforcing the rights of black citizens in the South, Jim Crow laws would make voting all but impossible for black men."
Social Studies,"Okay, now let's look at how values around citizenship changed before and after the Civil War. Who was a citizen before the Civil War and who was considered eligible to be part of the American people? Well white men definitely and white women, free people of color in the North with some limitations depending on their state of residents, immigrants arriving from Ireland and Germany were eligible for citizenship but Native Americans were considered to be members of separate nations not Americans."
Social Studies,"Mexican Americans and the territories acquired in the Mexican Cession were technically American citizens but had few legal protections. And enslaved people in the South were still considered property not citizens. How did that change after the Civil War? Well the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and the 13th Amendment in 1865 ended slavery. The 14th Amendment in 1868 made all people born or naturalized in the United States citizens, granting citizenship to African American men and women in the South."
Social Studies,"But again, the end of Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow made it difficult for them to access the rights of citizenship after 1877. White men and women and immigrants were still citizens. The US government began to stop treating Native Americans as members of separate nations but started classifying them as wards of the state rather than citizens."
Social Studies,"In the West, Chinese immigrants were looked upon as two different to become citizens and they would soon be forbidden from entering the United States at all. Mexican Americans saw little change in their precarious status."
Social Studies,"Finally, how did Americans view the proper role of the United States in the world before and after the Civil War? In 1844, the US was still practicing isolationism to avoid entangling alliances abroad but the ideas of manifest destiny led to a general sense that the United States had a divine mission to occupy North America from coast to coast which provided the impetus for the Mexican War and for Indian Removal."
Social Studies,"After the Civil War, both isolationism as a foreign policy outside North America and manifest destiny as a foreign policy within North America continued on as before. So now let's return to our question, how much did the Civil War change American national identity? In terms of ideas about democracy there was definitely a big expansion of the franchise due to the Civil War with the addition of two million African American men as new voters in the South after the ratification of the 15th Amendment."
Social Studies,"But that was short-lived. The Jim Crow system would effectively prevent black voters in the South from casting ballots until the 1960s. In terms of citizenship, that too was altered by the passage of a constitutional amendment. In this case, the 14th Amendment. Those citizenship guarantees were also short-lived but let's not forget the long-term importance of the 14th and 15th Amendments for securing equal rights in the 20th century."
Social Studies,"Even though those rights were only on paper during the Jim Crow era that paper would eventually be very important for expanding voting and citizenship rights after World War II. As for ideas about America's role in the world, those didn't change much at all. The drive to expand the borders of the United States all the way to the Pacific only intensified after the Civil War. So we might answer our question with the following thesis statement."
Social Studies,"The Civil War brought on some immediate short-term changes in American ideals of democracy and citizenship, which would fade after the end of Reconstruction, while the belief in the divine mission of the United States to spread across North America only intensified in this time period. Even though there was little change in the 19th century, the seeds planted immediately after the Civil War would sprout into major changes in the 20th century."
Social Studies,What do you think? How would you weigh these pieces of evidence to draw conclusions about how the Civil War changed American values? You might come up with a completely different thesis statement than I did and that's perfectly fine. The important part of thinking like a historian is to gather evidence and then craft an argument supported by that evidence..
Social Studies,"-  Because everything was great and covered in gold? -  No, because it is the only era of American history I can think of that has a sarcastic name. (laughter) -  What's to be sarcastic about? What's happening between, so I see it's from 1865 to 1898 which is the end of the Civil War, and then what happens in 1898? -  It's basically everyone woke up one morning and were like ""oh we're done with the Gilded Age, now it's time for the Progressive Era""."
Social Studies,"-  Hooray, Spanish-American wartimes! -  More first the Spanish-American War. So the Gilded Age is kind of this period of really intense industrialization and kind of focusing on America's development as an industrial and business power. It's very inward looking, whereas after the Spanish-American war the United States takes a bigger role on the world's stage. The sarcastic part of the Gilded Age is that this was a term coined by Mark Twain of all people, in 1890."
Social Studies,"And he wrote a book called ""The Gilded Age"", and what Twain was trying to say was that the United States in this period wasn't experiencing a golden age, an era of prosperity and happiness, but rather a Gilded Age. -  Oh so just like a thin layer of gold on top, disguising the cheap tin beneath? -  Exactly. -  Oh snap, Mark Twain."
Social Studies,"(laughter) So what's going on in this era that earns this nickname? What is the appearance of fancy, lovely gold that just turns out to be tacky and miserable? -  Well I think what people are talking about under the title of Gilded Age is that it's this time when immense wealth is accumulated by a number of individuals. Many of whom still have their names on things today. Like Andrew Carnegie, of Carnegie Mellon University, or Carnegie Hall. J.P. Morgan, who was a banking magnet."
Social Studies,"We still have J.P. Morgan as a financial institution today. And I would say John D. Rockefeller is another. He was a founder of standard oil, so he was an oil baron. Of Rockefeller Center, right. So these are the individuals who got enormously wealthy in the Gilded Age. And they got wealthy by being the captians of these new expanding industries. -  Titans of industry. -  The titans of industry. So steel, and banking, and oil. But they got rich partly through political corruption."
Social Studies,"So one of the less than savory parts of the Gilded Age is that. A lot of this was done through political kickbacks, bribing of officials, bribing of the vice president of the United States. -  Woah woah woah, what? They bribed the vice president? (laughter) -  That was a scandal that dogged the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant -  Oh man. -  Credit Mobilier was a construction company that had less than savory ties to some people very high up in government."
Social Studies,"So these fortunes of people like Carnegie and Morgan were built partly on political corruption, and partly on the backs of waves of immigrant laborers. -  Like my ancestors. -  Like my ancestors. And so during this time period in the eastern part of Europe, in the southern part of Europe, there were political eruptions, there were just general poverty especially in Italy."
Social Studies,"In Russia there were a number of pogroms, which sent Russian Jews out of Russia and they came to the United States. And they came from very bad situations, so what they came to was a little bit better but it wasn't much better. -  Which is how they all ended up living in this one apartment in lower Manhattan, as you've detailed in this Jacob Riis photograph. -  Right. Okay so, Jacob Riss was a photographer in the 1890's."
Social Studies,"And he went around the lower east side of Manhattan, basically just photographing what he called ""How the Other Half Lives"". By the other half he meant immigrants, the poor who were living in the lower east side of Manhattan. Which, at that time, was the most dense section of humanity on Earth. And you can see here that this is a photograph from a tenement that he took a picture of."
Social Studies,"-  And what is a tenement? -  So tenements were these apartment dwellings which kind of sprang up, often in the backyards of other normal buildings. But they were sort of hastily constructed, they had many rooms in them, they weren't up to fire code. I'm not even sure there was a fire code. Most of the rooms didn't have windows or electric lighting, or ventilation. -  Sounds like a great place to live."
Social Studies,"(laughter) But does it have curb appeal, Kim? (laughter) -  There is some pictures that can show you no, most of them were next to giant rotting heaps of garbage. -  Oh boy. -  One of my favorite things about the story of Jacob Riis is that he was a pioneer in the field of photography because he used flash photography."
Social Studies,"So you know, you've seen in old movies those flashbulbs that go off, right? Cause that was the only way he could get these apartments -  Cause there was no lighting in them. -  There was no lighting in them. so you couldn't take a picture of them without light. So he brought his flash camera and he regularly set things on fire. -  Oh no. (laughter) -  In these apartments as he was trying to document what life was like. -  Oh that's awful."
Social Studies,"-  So this is a photograph by Riis called ""Five Cents a Spot"", and so you paid five cents a night to live in this apartment. And so if you count here, there's one, three, I think this is somebody else's legs, seven, did I get everybody? There might be somebody else hiding over here. Seven men sharing this room, and they're just doing the best they can. -  Right. -  And you compare that with this, which is John D. Rockefeller's mansion in New York."
Social Studies,"It's called and I'm gonna butcher this ""Kykuit"". So the real question of the Gilded Age is how is it that some people get so wealthy, while some people are incredibly poor? -  Sure. -  And whose responsibility is that? At one point, J.P. Morgan decides he is going to buy out Andrew Carnegie. He buys him out for more than four hundred million dollars, he loans money to the U.S. government. So he is the single biggest creditor to the U.S. government."
Social Studies,"At that point who has more power, the federal government, or J.P. Morgan? -  So we're really talking about the clash of two great and terrible energies, right? Like this immense wealth, and this immense deprivation. -  Yeah. -  How do they play out? -  We'll get to that in some more videos.."
Social Studies,"-  So, that was the revolution where they had steamships and canals and kinda this early creation of the market system in the United States, say like 1820s-1830s. The Second Industrial Revolution is more of a revolution of mass production, I would say, and ways of making and shipping and communicating about business transactions and materials that didn't exist before."
Social Studies,"-  So, what are some of these disruptive technologies (Kim laughs) that are really poised to change the shipment paradigm? So, okay, so off the top of my head, trains probably a huge deal in this period? -  Yes. -  So, we've got all this coal going and that means that there's a lot of smelting happening and that means that there's also a lot of steel happening too. -  Steel."
Social Studies,"I think if I had to choose one most important technology of the Gilded Age, it would have to be steel. Now, it's not like steel didn't actually exist before this. -  Right, steel had been around for millennia. -  Yeah, I think so. -  Millennium. -  But, what happens in this time period is there's a new process for making steel. It's called the Bessemer process. And the Bessemer process basically makes steel faster and it makes it cheaper."
Social Studies,"And in this time period, Andrew Carnegie we talked about being this major steel baron, railroads throughout the United States, partly supported, majorly supported by the U.S. government. And during this period, they lay 40,000 miles of new tracks of rail. -  That is so many miles. -  That is so many miles. -  How long is the United States from Los Angeles to New York? (Kim laughs) Like 3,000 miles? 3,100 miles? -  Yes."
Social Studies,"So, just imagine a nation where most railroad tracks had gone through sort of the eastern coastal cities up until 1865. Now, the entire country is connected by rail. There's more rail in the United States in 1900 than all of Europe combined. -  So, the Bessemer process of making steel is this foundational technology that enables a lot of the Gilded Age to happen. -  Right, so it enables the United States to move out and also to connect markets."
Social Studies,"So, you can now take raw materials from the West, which is really important, that's where the gold lives and also cattle ranching, you take those things from the West, you take them to the cities to be processed. Then, you take the finished goods and send them back out into the smaller towns. So, rail facilitates all of that. -  So, this is how my hometown became notorious-- -  Yeah. -  of Chicago."
Social Studies,"So, there would be cattle drives, I guess then, that came from the West and then they would all be slaughtered and processed in Chicago. -  Right, yeah. I'm a native Pennsylvanian, you're a native Chicagoan, and we are born from steel places, as the steel industry really grew up in Pittsburgh. And what I think is really interesting about steel too is that it's like a self-sustaining industry because you need the steel to make the railroads."
Social Studies,"And then, the railroad industry pays for the creation of steel, which facilitates the creation of more railroads, which necessitates the creation of more steel and it's just like this never-ending boom in steel in the Gilded Age. So, steel facilitates the United States moving outward, but it also facilitates the United States moving upward. -  Oh, I see what you did. That was good. -  Yeah, you like that? -  Yeah."
Social Studies,"-  So, steel allows for the construction of buildings that are taller than ever before. -  So, what is this building here? -  This building here is the Home Insurance Building in Chicago. I don't believe it is there anymore. And do you know what is special about the Home Insurance Building? -  No, what's special about it? -  The Home Insurance Building is considered to be the world's first skyscraper."
Social Studies,"-  What?! Awesome! -  Yeah, it looks pretty short for a skyscraper by modern standards. -  I mean, I couldn't build a building that tall. -  That's 10 stories tall. And what you can do with steel is build these steel-frame structures that allow you, without using stone, there's kind of like a steel cage underneath the facade of this. And so, you can build buildings that are taller while having windows. -  It's like a Faraday cage."
Social Studies,"I bet there was terrible cellphone reception in there. -  I imagine so, yeah. There were no cellphones at this time. All right, so you know what else made these tall buildings possible except for the steel structures? -  Was it elevators? -  It was totally elevators. -  Yes! -  Yes, see, you're better at this than you thought."
Social Studies,"-  Yeah! -  This is the time of the invention of the Otis elevator, and this is my little elevator entrance, that-- -  Nice! -  You could go to the top of a tall building without having to walk up 37 flights of stairs, which is pretty sweet for our efficiency, if not maybe our waistlines."
Social Studies,"-  Okay, so, but we've got this steel process which enable the construction of tons and tons of rail and tons and tons of buildings, of new buildings where you can put more industry and more people. And that enable cities to grow and wealth to grow. -  Yeah, exactly. So, there are more and more people flooding into cities."
Social Studies,"By 1870, there are more people working for other people for wages living in cities than people who work for themselves, which is a new era in the American economic system. There's some other really important business technologies that grow up in this time period as well. So, there's the telephone, which makes it possible to do business transactions on the spot. It revolutionized the speed of business very much the same way that the internet is gonna revolutionize the speed of business in the 1990s."
Social Studies,"You also have refrigeration, which you would not think would be that big of a deal, but think about how it allows you to move foodstuffs all over the country to new markets. You were just talking about Chicago, right? So, the only way that cattle could be driven into Chicago, slaughtered, and then have meat sent to all the other markets in the United States was through refrigerated train cars."
Social Studies,"And they have similar things for steamships that allow people to, for example, bring oranges from Florida to New York. So, it's this web of markets that are connecting the United States, and this is my terrible drawing of the United States, but rail and then ships make it possible for all of these markets to connect together over time and over space. -  That's super cool."
Social Studies,"-  You know, the railroad was even so important in this time period that, in a way, it invented the modern system of time. Because before the railroad, localities would just decide when noon was based on when the sun was highest in the sky, which meant that-- -  It didn't matter whether or not it was the same time in Kansas City as in St. Louis. But once you have a train connecting 'em, the St. Louis train gets in at 12:05, if you're off, you'll miss your train."
Social Studies,"-  Or that might lead to a collision of trains if they don't know when the other train is going to be coming through. -  Yeah, okay. So, inventions of the Gilded Age: intranational train travel, the telephone, refrigeration for meat, the Bessemer process for steel, and the standardization of time. -  All of those things. And I would say the last thing that might be really important here is also electrification."
Social Studies,"-  Oooh! -  Yeah, and like steel, electricity was not invented in the Gilded Age, but what happened was the spread of the light bulb in both homes and businesses, which meant that you could work longer hours. You didn't sleep as long. Actually, the amount of sleep that people got per night switched from about nine hours before electrification to about seven hours after. So, Thomas Edison is literally responsible for robbing us of sleep."
Social Studies,"But it also made it possible for workers to work longer hours and it significantly reduced the risk of fire in businesses, which meant you could invest in them with more confidence. -  Oh, because they didn't have gas lamps that could burst into flame. -  Right. -  Awesome, well that's super cool. So, hooray Gilded Age, right? -  Right."
Social Studies,"And I think one thing that's important to understand about these technologies is that one of the goals of these technologies was to make it possible to produce things faster, but also to produce them with less-skilled workers, because a skilled worker, someone who knows a craft and can produce a finished item from start to finish, that takes a long time and it costs a lot of money. This is the difference between buying a suit off the rack and having a bespoke suit."
Social Studies,"If you wanna pay someone for that time and talent, you're gonna pay a lot. But if you can make something on a machine, then you can make a lot of them very quickly and you don't need someone who is an expert tailor. You just need someone who can operate a sewing machine to do a couple of seams. So, what they're trying to do here with this innovation is spread consumer goods, spread a higher standard of living."
Social Studies,But they're also doing that at the price of having less-skilled workers making much smaller wages..
Social Studies,"You have the rise of oil and John Rockefeller and basically, this period, think of Rockefeller and Vanderbilt, as, and Carnegie and JP Morgan as powerful the way we think of presidents. Presidents during this period kind of were on the descent but the magnets of industry, railroad, oil, steel, those were all banking, those were the superheroes in America, and they led to this amazing growth in industrialization but then also huge disparities. No labor laws that we would be familiar with today."
Social Studies,"So you had this industrialization with people working in the industries who had no protections, child labor, working 22 hours a day, horrible health conditions. So this gurgling, booming America, but where there's great disparities between who's doing well and who's not. - And it was called Gilded because those who were doing well were living very well. - Right, Gilded as in a gilded frame, covered with cold which came from a novel by Mark Twain."
Social Studies,"And that's right, it takes on the caste of this extraordinary wealth. Rockefeller was the first billionaire in America, Vanderbilt built the biggest house, still the biggest house in America during this period. So the wealth was, people would make eight to $10 in a week, some of these tycoons were making eight to $10 in a minute. And so that kind of vast wealth, because you could only make so much wealth before, this is just mountains of wealth and then also, again, this great disparity."
Social Studies,"- And it seems like it came from, really, technology. Technology allowed all of this productivity, the railroads, steel, et cetera, et cetera, and then of course finance was able to get in there and help move capital more efficiently. What parallels do you see with our current age where technology seems to be doing something similar where we have all of these new industries, and new wealth, but some fear that it might be causing some inequality. - You have, yes, you have a couple of things."
Social Studies,"You have innovation in these very different industries, both innovation in the creation of things but then also innovations in the structures of business. Buying up small business, creating big conglomerates. Then using that leverage and power to then crowd out competitors for sure but then also raise prices because you're the only game in town."
Social Studies,"And you also have business practices that are not the sort of laissez-faire economic belief said essentially that in the economy it was like in the American system, which was let it operate. Don't get in the way, don't mess with it, because when it operates it runs the most efficiently for America. - In the end markets can be messy but they're gonna have the best outcome. - That's right. - Is the argument behind laissez-faire."
Social Studies,"- That's exactly right, and it got this wonderful assist from Charles Darwin who said, we can explain the growth of, or you can explain the species and we can explain our natural world with this theory about the competition among the species and this term survival of the fittest, social Darwinism, survival of the fittest, which some, and I certainly thought might've come from Darwin didn't, it came from Herbert Spencer who basically had an economic theory of the survival of the fittest and then it went this way."
Social Studies,"Some people have more talent than others and when they exercise their talent they do very well and that's the best thing for society. It believed that society was ever increasing, it didn't mean that every single person was increasing, but that if you followed survival of the fittest and the best people did the best then ultimately society will always be on an evolutionary plane of moving upward."
Social Studies,"And so that was the theory behind get out of the way of these big companies and big tycoons and they will do the best for America and so the reason that was important was A, it kept government out of the way, B, it kept religious, it created a religion, it was a secular religion of course, but it created a theory that said, wow that looks like what you're doing is totally self interested but there's this theory behind it and everybody will improve so okay, go ahead."
Social Studies,"- Yeah, that was the beginning of Gordon Gekko's famous greed is good. - Right, right, yeah. Yeah, greed is good, so the comparison to our current moment is you have huge disparity and technologies that are, to use a cliche of the day, disruptive that are completely changing the way everybody does business, changing when we think about the way in which Americans behave, that rapid sense of change, it's changing culture rapidly and it's making big winners and losers and those big disparities exist as well."
Social Studies,"- How did the Gilded Age play out? Were some of these forces moderated eventually, maybe around 1900, and do you think similar things might happen for us? - There were two big moderation in response to the Gilded Age. You had government came awake again and then you also had labor movements that came into formation, basically to slow down the growth and the rapacious demands of the Gilded Age. Politics during the Gilded Age kind of went, became an offshoot of the titans of industry."
Social Studies,"If you look at the presidency between 1876 and 1892 they're all one term presidents and none of them get more than 50% of the vote and basically what the presidents spend their time doing is using the spoil system, which is essentially putting people in jobs to pay off the local bosses who helped them get elected."
Social Studies,"So getting elected became a job of staying elected and that meant dolling out patronage, basically giving people jobs who were your friends so that they would go and vote for you because these elections were all very close and that's not getting a lot of work done for the people. Some of 'em, Rutherford B."
Social Studies,"Hayes tried these little efforts at civil service reform, which essentially meant putting people in jobs who could monitor the factories, make sure that people weren't getting abused or that health wasn't declining or that anything that a government might do that we think of today but his political patrons didn't want that. So that was all very hard to do."
Social Studies,"What happened on the worker's end is they realized, and the most famous moment was in 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire where a number of women working in a garment factory are, there's a fire and the bosses lock the doors and I think 40 some odd women die, mostly women, and it highlighted the labor issues but labor unions start to organize and there are huge clashes and strikes and consumer boycotts and those start to put some pressure on business to change their practices, at least in terms of worker hours and the kinds of things that we now would certainly take for granted."
Social Studies,- Fascinating. - It's an incredible period. - Yeah..
Social Studies,"So, if it affects how many offspring it's able to leave behind in the next generation, then it's possible for certain traits that are well-suited to the organism's immediate environment to become more and more common in the population over generations. So that's kind of the idea of natural selection in a nutshell. -  And we also talked about the fact that there's no such thing as one race or one organism being more evolved than another organism because we've all been evolving this whole time."
Social Studies,"So what I'd like to do now is just to talk about some of the ways that the sociologists of this time kind of mis-applied Darwin's theories, and just get your opinions on how what they were saying actually relates with how Biology really works. So, Herbert Spencer was a sociologist from England. He's actually the person who coined the term ""survival of the fittest"", which I think is interesting. So it wasn't Darwin who coined this term but rather, Spencer."
Social Studies,"And I think what was animating people like Spencer and other Social Darwinists in this time was just to say, ""Why are some people ""in a better social position than others?"" So, why are some people poor versus rich, why do African-Americans or people from colonized nations have a worse situation in the world than people in civilized nations, or ""civilized,"" kind of in air quotes, from that time period? And what Spencer said was, ""Oh, this must be Darwinism."" Right, it must be that people who are wealthy are better adapted to their environment; they're more evolved than people who are poor."
Social Studies,"So I think this idea of difference between the classes was one of the first animations behind the idea of Social Darwinism. So, is there any way that that actually relates to how Biology explains Darwinism? -  I mean, I think that that's really a case of an idea from Biology being not very accurately applied to society."
Social Studies,"You know, I think that there is probably a strong motivation for someone in Spencer's position to want to explain things in that way because that would justify inaction on his part and sort of say that this is acceptable because it's ""natural"". And, you know, I think that it's really not a very scientific or even an investigative perspective. I think that it was sort of an effort to fit something, sort of a round peg in a square hole, so to speak. -  Yeah, it's interesting."
Social Studies,"As I've been learning more about this, I've noticed that people in general seem to take up one of these explanations for like how the universe works, and then try to apply it to everything, even if it might not necessarily apply."
Social Studies,"So I think your word ""inaction"" here is really accurate because one of the things that Spencer is just wondering about is like, ""Should the government do something ""for people who are poor, ""for people who are in a bad position?"" And he basically says, ""No,"" 'cause his idea is that if the government helps them, then you're interfering with this survival of the fittest, and that those sorts of people should naturally be bred out of the populace to make our other race more evolved."
Social Studies,"So is there any truth into this idea that you could make the human race more evolved by breeding out certain parts of it? -  My tendency would be to say that any program designed to reduce variation in a biological population is probably not going to be beneficial for that population. So that's kind of a broad statement but if you look at factors that make endangered species endangered, one of the big ones is that they have very low genetic variation in their gene pool."
Social Studies,"And that means that harmful gene versions are more likely to come together in the same individuals, so it's more likely for there to be genetic defects or genetic disorders. In general, a high level of variation is an indicator of a healthy population and a low level of variation, or any population where you have intensive inbreeding of similar individuals, that's gonna be a population that's probably less healthy."
Social Studies,"-  Interesting, because there's this very popular movement in the United States and then moving on to places like Germany, where we see this very strongly in the Holocaust of eugenics, right? The idea that you can make your race and your country more evolved, more fit, this survival of the fittest, by breeding out certain things that are termed ""undesirable."" -  I mean, in terms of long-term population survival from a biological standpoint, I don't see how that could be beneficial."
Social Studies,"I mean, you never know what's down the road. You never know if there's a new infectious disease that's gonna show up and who's gonna be resistant to it. Somebody who has genetic variation, that doesn't matter right now, but you don't know who that's gonna be. So it's that sort of general principle applies that the reason variation is great, is it prepares a population to deal with an uncertain future."
Social Studies,"-  This is so interesting to me because I think you see this a lot in history, because people in some ways here, there are very much confusing culture for Biology, because in many cases, they're saying that traits that they see as culturally undesirable, you know, looking through the eyes of white supremacy and sort of this racial and cultural supremacy of people from England, from the United States, from Western Europe, you know, they're looking around them and they see people who are different from them, and they ascribe that to a kind of biological inferiority when, in fact, it's just a cultural difference."
Social Studies,"-  I think that that's a very good way to state it; I think that there's just a big conflation here of cultural and biological, and applying ideas that might be great for one in a place where they're not actually as well-suited."
Social Studies,"-  Yeah, and I think that one thing that also interests me about this is the way that things like eugenics are used as justifications, and using Darwinism as a justification for not helping certain people, for saying, ""Oh, you're less evolved; ""you belong at the bottom of the social scale, ""and if I help you, then I'm not helping us ""evolve as a race,"" with also kind of a flip-side of saying, ""Oh, we must help certain cultures ""become more civilized."" And you see that a lot in the era of colonialism, which is also big in the Gilded Age."
Social Studies,"It's kind of becoming a world event in the Gilded Age as England begins to take colonies in India, and Africa, and other nations do the same. One of the justifications that they're giving is ""These people are less civilized than us. ""They're less evolved than us, ""and so we have to help them. ""It's the white man's burden,"" a phrase by Rudyard Kipling, to help these other races evolve."
Social Studies,"-  Yeah, that's a very definite conflation of biological and social, I mean, teaching people to behave in a different way does not affect their biology. That was actually one of Spencer's misconceptions."
Social Studies,"He was an adherent of Lamarckian evolution which would suggest that if you gain a trait during your lifetime, you will biologically and genetically pass it on to your offspring and you may pass it on to your offspring by teaching them something, but genetic traits that are acquired during your life, you don't pass those on. You actually don't generally inherit-- -  They are acquired genetic traits. -  Yeah, exactly."
Social Studies,"So I think that that definitely reflects the confusion in terms of what biological evolution is and how it works mechanistically. -  I think if there's anything for us to take away from this, it's that one, there's no such thing as one person being more evolved than another person, or one race being more evolved than another race. I think there's actually not much of a biological basis for the concept of race, to start with, since human beings are biologically 99.9% the same."
Social Studies,"-  Yeah, I mean, from everything that I've seen, race is really something that people have come up with in an effort to categorize the world around them, but it's not actually reflected very meaningfully in people's genetics."
Social Studies,"You know, there are certain very superficial physical traits that are inherited, that we define as ""race"", but if you actually look at the genomes of the people who belong to a particular racial group, that is socially defined, there's a huge amount of variation there, and there's much more variation within what we would consider a race, than there are differences that separate races. Basically, it's a pretty arbitrary way to categorize people.."
Social Studies,"Compare that to just 40 years later when not one, but three cities had passed the million mark, and New York had nearly 3.5 million residents. Proportionally, Chicago's population growth was even more drastic, from only about 100,000 residents in 1860, it got 17 times bigger by 1900, with about 1.7 million residents. Traditionally, Americans had been a pretty rural farming people, but starting in the late 19th century, there was a rapid shift towards urbanization."
Social Studies,"By 1920, urban residents would outnumber country dwellers in the United States for the first time. And today, more than 80% of Americans live in cities. So what led to this explosion in the population of cities in the decades after the Civil War? The major factors behind this shift were industrialization, immigration, and migration."
Social Studies,"Now we've been talking about those three things in various forms in American history up until this point, from the cool inventions of the first industrial revolution to the influx of Irish and German immigrants in the 1840s to the movement of Americans ever westward. So industrialization, immigration, and migration weren't new forces in American society, but there were unique aspects of all three of these processes during the Gilded Age that contributed to the development of cities in this era."
Social Studies,"One thing that changed was the nature of work that people did. During the Gilded Age, there was a tipping point in the American labor market. In 1880, for the first time ever, the number of people who worked for someone else for wages, people who had a boss and needed to do what they said to get paid, outnumbered Americans who worked for themselves, like farmers who could decide for themselves when to sow or harvest their crops."
Social Studies,"The second industrial revolution, which began after the Civil War, was a booming era of expansion and industrial production. So there were a lot of factory jobs available, and most of those jobs were for unskilled laborers, that is workers who don't require any kind of special training before they start a job. So there was an overall transition from farm work that was self-directed to unskilled factory work done for a boss."
Social Studies,"Another change during the Gilded Age was in who was doing the immigrating and migrating. Until the 1840s, most immigrants to the United States had been Protestant Christians from northern and western Europe, and they were relatively well off financially. After the Civil War, a variety of factors abroad, combined with the wide availability of jobs in the United States, brought different types of immigrants to American cities."
Social Studies,"These new immigrants, as they were called, tended to be from southern and eastern Europe, Mexico, and Asia, and they differed from old immigrants in that they tended to be poorer, have darker complexions, and practiced Catholicism or Judaism instead of Protestantism. In addition in this era, African Americans from the south began to migrate to northern and mid-western cities. All of these immigrants and migrants created a large industrial workforce."
Social Studies,"But why did they all move to the city? Let's take a look at some of the push and pull factors that prompted people to uproot themselves and head to American cities during the Gilded Age. First, there were push factors, or things that were pushing people out of their previous living situations. A big one was poverty and just a lack of financial mobility at home. Farmers in many countries were hit hard by the mechanization of agriculture, which happened in this time period."
Social Studies,"About a third of the people moving to cities were Americans leaving farms and heading to the city for industrial jobs. Another push factor was persecution and discrimination at home. The Russian government took an increasingly intolerant position towards Jews in this time period, who were subject to mob violence and campaigns of ethnic cleansing in Europe."
Social Studies,"In the American south, the emergence of Jim Crow laws and an increase in lynchings were among the reasons that African Americans elected to leave after the Civil War. But what were the pull factors that landed them in cities? For one thing, many struggling immigrants from abroad didn't have the money to go anywhere else. So after they arrived, they just stayed put. But the main reason that people moved to cities is because that's where the jobs were."
Social Studies,"With the development of steam power and electrification, factories no longer had to be located next to waterways. So cities developed as industrial hubs. Often cities would develop as the center for one specific industry, like steel in Pittsburgh, meat packaging in Chicago, or clothing in New York. People also found communities of support in cities. Earlier immigrants might send money and information to their families and friends back home, helping them to move and get established."
Social Studies,"This facilitated the development of urban neighborhoods, where people from similar backgrounds spoke the same language, ate the same food, and provided each other with assistance. In these ethnic enclaves, people could get newspapers and even go to see theater performances in their native languages. So let's finish by taking a look at two narratives of immigrants arriving in American cities in this time period."
Social Studies,"The first one is from Lee Chew, who immigrated to San Francisco from China at age 16 in the year 1880. He wrote, ""When I got to San Francisco, ""which was before the passage of the Exclusion Act, ""I was half starved, because I was afraid ""to eat the provisions of the barbarians. ""But a few days living in the Chinese quarter ""made me happy again. ""A man got me work as a house servant ""in an American family."
Social Studies,"""When I went to work for that American family, ""I could not speak a word of English, ""and I didn't know anything about housework. ""I did not understand what the lady said to me, ""but she showed me how to cook, wash, iron, sweep, dust, ""make beds, wash dishes, clean windows, paint and brass, ""polish the knives and forks, et cetera. ""In six months, ""I had learned how to do the work of our house quite well, ""and I was getting $5 a week and board ""and putting away about $4.25 a week."
Social Studies,"""I had also learned some English. ""I sent money home to comfort my parents. ""But though I dressed well and lived well and had pleasure, ""going quite often to the Chinese theater ""and to dinner parties in Chinatown, ""I saved $50 in the first six months."" The second one is from Mary Antin, who immigrated to Boston from what is now Belarus at the age of 13 in the year 1894. She wrote, ""The first meal was an object lesson of much variety."
Social Studies,"""My father produced several kinds of food ready to eat, ""without any cooking, from little tin cans ""that had printing all over them. ""He attempted to introduce us to a queer, ""slippery kind of fruit, which he called banana, ""but had to give it up for the time being. ""On our second day, a little girl from across the alley ""came and offered to conduct us to school. ""My father was out, but we five between us ""had a few words of English by this time. ""We knew the word school. ""We understood."
Social Studies,"""This child who had never seen us 'til yesterday, ""who could not pronounce our names, ""who was not much better dressed than we, ""was able to offer us the freedom of the schools of Boston. ""We had to visit the stores and be dressed ""from head to foot in American clothing. ""We had to learn the mysteries of the iron stove, ""the washboard, and the speaking tube, ""and above all, we had to learn English. ""With our despised immigrant clothing, ""we shed also our impossible Hebrew names."
Social Studies,"""A committee of our friends, ""several years ahead of us in American experience, ""put their heads together ""and concocted American names for us all."" So what similarities and differences do you see between the experiences of Lee Chew and Mary Antin? Why do you think they immigrated to American cities, and what do you think their lives would be like going forward in the Gilded Age?."
Social Studies,"So, at a glance, the Gilded Age seems like a time of radical change for the country. But, as historians, how can we tell just how much change really occurred from 1865 to 1898? One way we can do this is to track over time what changed and what stayed the same from the beginning of the Gilded Age to its end. Historians call this process examining continuity and change over time."
Social Studies,"When we study history, it's important to look at continuities, or things that continued on the same as they were before, because it's really easy to focus on how one aspect of society really transformed during a certain period of time and then forget to account for the fact that almost everything else didn't change at all, but it would be practically impossible to track the changes in every aspect of society. So let's dial in on a few areas."
Social Studies,"Since the major transformations came through technology and business in this time period, and those are both aspects of work, I'm curious about how the kind of work that people did and the way that they did it changed over the course of the Gilded Age. And since I know that cities grew a lot during this time period, let's also look at changes in living patterns. Where people migrated to and from and how they lived."
Social Studies,I'm also curious about the extent to which these changes in work and living patterns affected the major ideas and culture of the time.
Social Studies,"Did people's beliefs about society change much during the Gilded Age? Or was the culture of the United States at the end of the 19th century pretty much the same as it was at the end of the Civil War? So let's look at the major trends in each of these areas at the beginning and the end of this time period so we can try to answer the question how much change did industrialization really bring during the Gilded Age? By the way, I'm not gonna go into a whole lot of detail on these trends because we're doing a really big overview of the Gilded Age here."
Social Studies,"So if you find that you're not familiar with something that comes up, just make a note of it and you can look it up when you have time. Okay, first, let's compare the changes in work and business from 1865 to 1898. Well in 1865, the United States was still a primarily a nation of farmers, although there were a good number of people in the North and the West who worked in mills, and mines, and on railroads."
Social Studies,"Many African Americans had transitioned from working as slave laborers on plantations in the South to working as sharecroppers, where they would work portions of plantations in return for a pretty measly share of the profits. In fact, most work in the United States was segregated by race. It was pretty uncommon for whites, African Americans, Chinese laborers, or Mexican American laborers to work side by side anywhere."
Social Studies,"In terms of the way businesses were organized, the Civil War had sowed some initial seeds of business consolidation. The industrial might that had helped the North win the Civil War made it easy for some large companies to begin turning natural resources into infrastructure."
Social Studies,"How did that compare to the state of work in 1898? Well there were still plenty of farmers and sharecroppers, although the mechanization of agriculture in the late 19th century had a negative effect on many farmers, sending them to the city looking for work. By the end of the century more people worked for someone else for wages than worked for themselves for the first time in American history."
Social Studies,"A lot of this factory growth was driven by new business practices like mass production on the assembly line, which broke complex tasks down into tiny steps so that no one required much training to work in a factory. A process known as deskilling. Women and children began working in factories as well, but as at the beginning of the Gilded Age work places still tended to be racially segregated and by the end of the 19th century businesses undergone major consolidation."
Social Studies,"Often using monopolistic practices to dominate industries and fix prices and wages. In response, many workers began to organize labor unions, but they had pretty limited success. So overall, I would say that industrialization led to some pretty major changes in the world of work, although work generally remained segregated and the process of transitioning from farms to factories wasn't entirely complete. During the Gilded Age there was a huge shift towards unskilled wage work and big corporations."
Social Studies,"Next let's look at living and migration patterns. In 1865 only about 20% of the population lived in cities. Most of the migrants to cities were Irish and German immigrants coming from Northern and Western Europe. Most African Americans continued to live in the South in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War and the cities themselves had pockets of density and poverty, like New York City's Five Points neighborhood, but they weren't yet incredibly crowded."
Social Studies,"What about in 1898? Well, the percentage of the population living in cities nearly doubled, up to 40%. Several cities grew to more than one million people for the first time during the Gilded Age and who was coming to the cities changed as well. Political and economic trouble at home led many Southern and Eastern Europeans to head for the factories in American cities and African Americans also began to slowly trickle northward in order to escape sharecropping and Jim Crow."
Social Studies,"This massive influx of people meant that cities were very dense and many people had to crowd into tenements, unsafe, unventilated, ramshackle apartment buildings. In 1900, the Lower East Side of Manhattan was the most densely populated neighborhood in the world. So I would say that industrialization also led to quite the transformation in living and migration patterns."
Social Studies,"The factory jobs available in American cities drew new people to them from all over the country, and the world, and also changed the standards of living. Last, let's map the changes and continuities in prominent cultural ideas over the course of the Gilded Age."
Social Studies,"Although there are lots of different ideas and forms of cultural expression we could talk about, I'm gonna focus on ideas about the economy, and race, and immigration since those are so closely tied to the other two categories of analysis we've got here."
Social Studies,"Immediately after the Civil War, there was an intense push in Congress and in the North to ensure racial equality for African Americans with the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, but there was also a very strong nativist or anti-immigrant sentiment among white native born Protestants who especially objected to the immigration of Irish Catholics."
Social Studies,"As far as the economy went, there were many people who argued in favor of laissez faire economics, that the government should engage in little to no regulation of the market and that was pretty much the prevailing government approach of the day."
Social Studies,"Alright, how does that compare to 1898? Well unlike in the immediate post war period, racial equality for African Americans had been abandoned as a mainstream idea with the rise of Jim Crow and rulings like the 1896 Supreme Court case, Plessy versus Ferguson, which approved segregation."
Social Studies,"Nativism was also still a force in American life and it had even intensified thanks to the flawed racial pseudo-science known as Social Darwinism, which suggested that people who were in high positions in society, both in terms of race and wealth, belonged there because they were the fittest. But there were a few reformers who were beginning to question the effects of industrialization like settlement house founder, Jane Addams or early muckraker Jacob Riis."
Social Studies,"So in terms of ideas and culture, it looks like there was actually more continuity than change over the course of the Gilded Age. There may even have been an overall regression in ideas about race and immigration in this time period. There were a few efforts to soften the pains of industrialization and urbanization, but they weren't yet widespread."
Social Studies,Let's return to our question then and see if we can formulate a thesis statement to address the extent to which industrialization brought change from 1865 to 1898.
Social Studies,"From the evidence we've gathered, I'd say that the technological and business advancements of the Second Industrial Revolution brought enormous changes to the ways that people lived and worked in the United States, transforming the country from a rural farming nation to an urban industrial one, but the major ideas about immigration, race, and the economy didn't change as much."
Social Studies,Segregation and nativist sentiment intensified over the time period and efforts to reign in the excesses of industrial capitalism were just getting started. The major social efforts to improve the lives and work of this new urban population would have to wait until the Progressive Era..
Social Studies,"So, this might be transportation, separate areas in trains and buses, or hotels, bathrooms, swimming pools, water fountains. So, these places in public life, where African Americans were put in the place of a second-class citizenship. Where they could not experience the full range of movement, job benefits, protection of the law, or really any of the aspects of American citizenship, that are the benefits that come with paying taxes and abiding by the law."
Social Studies,"And during this period of Jim Crow this kind of segregation was legal, this was not just in practice, but encoded in the law. So, where did this System of Jim Crow come from? Well, let's start with the name Jim Crow. Jim Crow was not the name of a specific person. Actually, Jim Crow was the name of a stock character."
Social Studies,"A stock character is kind of a basic well-known character, in usually a comedy, and we still have stock characters in comedy today, in lots of different forms of entertainment; Think of, the absent-minded professor, or more recently, the manic-pixie-dream girl, the girl who is going to change your whole life by being so off-the-wall. Well, Jim Crow was one of these characters in a form of entertainment called the minstrel show."
Social Studies,"And the minstrel show was a very popular, kind of vaudeville-type live performance. The minstrel show was actually very popular in the north of the United States, places like New York City. And in the 1830s, 1840s, kind of this antebellum period, before the Civil War. So, this character of Jim Crow was supposed to be kind of the stupid slave who lived on the plantation, and this character of Jim Crow was almost always played by a white man wearing black makeup on his face."
Social Studies,"So, it was not an actual African American person, but rather a caricature of an African American person by a white man who was part of a minstrel troupe. And so the name, Jim Crow, became kind of synonymous with African American's and with enslaved people in the early 19th century, the way that say Patty became synonymous with an Irish person. So, the term Jim Crow Law, or the Jim Crow System means laws that were specifically aimed at African Americans."
Social Studies,"Alright, so that's the origin of the name, but where did they system come from? And for that we're gonna have to do fairly deep dive into American history, and I won't be able to go into everything here but let's kind of look at this from the thousand-foot view and get a sense of the overall pattern of slavery, the Civil War, and race relations after the Civil War to see where Jim Crow starts. Now, I've been daring here and done a vertical timeline."
Social Studies,"The first thing we have on here is the end of the Civil War. Now, before the Civil War in the southern part of the United States, which I have outlined in red here, most of these states had legal slavery. And in these states, or the colonies that preceded them, starting about 1620, they imported African slaves to be unfree laborers on cash-crop plantations, and these might include tobacco, or cotton."
Social Studies,"And that system of slavery persisted until the balance of power between the north, where slavery was largely illegal, and the South, where slavery was the backbone of the economic and political system. Eventually it tore the country apart into the Civil War. In 1863, Abraham Lincoln, the President of the United States issued the Emancipation Proclamation, saying that all enslaved people, and the states which were currently in rebellion were now free."
Social Studies,"But it wasn't until the end of the Civil War that slavery's end was official everywhere in the United States. And the end of slavery really posed a problem for the states of the South. Now obviously this was a wonderful thing for people who had been enslaved, now they had full freedom to move, and work, and marry whomever they pleased, at least in theory."
Social Studies,"But it also meant that the system of slavery, which had dominated the politics, the economics, the social system of the South for more than 200 years was now over, and something had to replace it. So, in the immediate period after the Civil War the question is, what are race relations going to look like in the South? How will whites and blacks relate to each other without the system of slavery, which has dominated the entire region for more than 200 years? And we'll get into that in our next video.."
Social Studies,"In 1863 Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which ended slavery in all states that were rebelling against the United States, and in 1865 the government ratified the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which outlawed slavery for good."
Social Studies,"But all the 13th Amendment said was that you couldn't have slavery, it really didn't say anything about what race relations between whites and blacks in the south would be after the Civil War, or whether not being a slave meant that an African American person in the south had the full rights of citizenship that a white person would have, so in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, states in the south began writing new constitutions to account for the end of slavery, but the white leaders in the south really have no conception of a world where African Americans are equal to whites, and so the new laws that they write regulating African Americans after the war are known as the Black Codes, and these Black Codes are in many ways slavery by a different name."
Social Studies,"So the Black Codes acknowledged the end of slavery, and they give some basic rights to African Americans such as the right to marry, which enslaved people could not legally do under the system of slavery, and the right to own property. But that is pretty much it."
Social Studies,"The Black Codes did things like prevent African Americans from owning firearms, from being without a labor contract, now remember the south is based on these cash crops like tobacco and cotton, and landowners are terrified that if all of the former enslaved people leave the south, they're going to have nobody to work in their fields, nobody to harvest these crops, and their economic system is going to plummet, they're already in very bad shape after the Civil War."
Social Studies,"So they say, all African Americans have to be in a labor contract, and these labor contracts were usually very small wages for quite a bit of labor, and if they were not in a labor contract or if they left in the middle of a year, say, then they were considered vagrants. And the most outrageous thing that these southern governments do is say that African Americans cannot vote."
Social Studies,"Now to people in the north, who had just fought a four year-long war where more than half a million people died, to end slavery, seeing southern states pass laws that are pretty much slavery with another name, was galling."
Social Studies,"And so the more radical Republican elements in Congress, these are members of Abraham Lincoln's party, who are strongly abolitionist, who are strongly in favour of civil rights for African Americans, and strongly in favor of a strong central government, say ""OK, this system of Black Codes is not OK."
Social Studies,"""When we said slavery was over, ""we didn't just mean that you couldn't enslave someone, ""we also meant that African Americans ""had full citizenship rights in the south."" So to combat the Black Codes, Congress passes the 14th Amendment to the Constitution."
Social Studies,"And the 14th Amendment says that anyone who was born in the United States, regardless of whether or not they were a slave, is a full citizen of the United States eligible for all of the benefits of citizenship and equal protection under the law, so laws must be equal for whites and for blacks. And we'll get into what that means, in the next video.."
Social Studies,"guaranteed that anyone born in the United States, regardless of previous condition of servitude, had full citizenship, meaning they're entitled to all the rights and privileges of being a citizen, and equal protection under the law. So a law could not target someone on the basis of their race."
Social Studies,"Now to enforce the 14th Amendment, Congress sent federal troops to the states in the South, divided the Southern region up into military zones and said that the South would be occupied by federal troops until the states rewrote their constitutions to recognize the 14th Amendment, in effect to give equal citizenship to African Americans. In fact they also passed the 15th Amendment two years later in 1870, which said voting rights are included among these citizenship rights guaranteed in the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,I should mention that these voting rights were only for African American men as women will not get the right to vote until 1920. So from the 14th Amendment until 1877 there's a military occupation in the South and military troops are only taken away from the Southern states when they write their constitutions to grant equal citizenship to African Americans.
Social Studies,"Now you can imagine in the South where whites have had racial supremacy from the 1600s, getting them to recognize social equality with African Americans was an incredible struggle and it was a struggle that the republicans in Congress and the federal troops really didn't win. This is the era of the Ku Klux Klan, which ran terrorist raids at night trying to prevent African Americans from voting or to prevent their allies from helping them to vote."
Social Studies,"This era of reconstruction was really a continuation of the Civil War where troops from the North tried to enforce the 14th Amendment, tried to enforce the end of slavery and the citizenship of African Americans with really implacable resistance from white Southerners. So by 1877, only two states were left that still had troops 'cause the rest of the states had rewritten their constitutions to acknowledge the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,But that is not to say that racial equality had been achieved in the South whatsoever. So what happened in 1877? Which is generally known as the end of reconstruction and the beginning of this period of Jim Crow segregation. Well we'll get to that in the next video..
Social Studies,"And in this election there was one of the rare cases where Tilden actually won the popular vote whereas Hayes won the electoral vote. So there's a standoff in Congress for months over how this presidential election is going to end and eventually they make kind of a backroom deal known as the Compromise of 1877. And in this compromise the Democrats and the Republicans agree that Hayes, a Republican, will get to be President of the United States."
Social Studies,"In exchange the military forces that have been occupying the South, especially the last two states of Louisiana and South Carolina and have been enforcing the 14th Amendment or the equal citizenship of African Americans in the South they're going to leave, they're going to go back to their barracks and will no longer interfere in the political system of the South."
Social Studies,"So with the Compromise of 1877 the Republican Party which has been standing behind the rights of African Americans, remember the Republicans were the Party of Abraham Lincoln, pretty much gives up as a Party on trying to ensure the racial equality of African Americans. Now why did they do this? Well, I think mainly this was a question of weariness and giving up on their part. Remember that the Civil War ended in 1865, now it's 12 years later in 1877 and there are still Federal troops in the South."
Social Studies,"So imagine if you were a parent in Massachusetts and you thought that your son who was enlisted in the Union Army was going to come home in 1865 and now it's 1877 and he's still in South Carolina it seems like a long time to fight a war. So that's one part of it. The other part of it is that in 1873 there is an economic panic, this is an early Depression."
Social Studies,You know we often think of the Great Depression as the only time the United States was stricken with an economic downturn but before the Depression there were about 20 year cycles of boom and bust. So in 1873 there was an economic bust that meant that people had less money to throw at the problem of reconstruction in the South. And I would say the last part of this is a combination of racism and the new labor movement in the North.
Social Studies,So as whites in the North got farther and farther away from the Civil War the animating spirit of abolition started to fade among many Northerners. The late 19th century was an era of increasing racialization especially as new ethnic classes came into the United States from Southern and Eastern Europe and so there was a new interpretation of race that really came to the foreground in this time period which we call Social Darwinism and we'll talk more about that in other videos.
Social Studies,"But the interpretation of racial difference and hierarchy among the races became more broadly accepted throughout the United States not just in the South. So in 1877 the Federal troops in the South, that are remaining, pack their bags and go home meaning that African Americans in the South have no one to protect them from the Southern governments and so within months many of these governments pass the laws which we now call Jim Crow laws."
Social Studies,"And these are the laws which prevent African Americans from voting, prevent intermarriage between whites and blacks, and also enact all of these separations of public accommodations that we now associate with Jim Crow, sitting in the back of the bus, using a separate water fountain."
Social Studies,"Now if it sounds like these sorts of laws are directly in contradiction with the 14th Amendment which says that laws cannot target a specific race, that there's equal protection under the law for everyone born in the United States you're right that's exactly what these laws are. They are a contradiction of the 14th Amendment. And in 1896 a man named Homer Plessy was arrested for sitting in a white train compartment."
Social Studies,You thought Rosa Parks was the first but in fact it's Homer Plessy who tries to desegregate trains. In fact he's trying to test the constitutionality of having segregated train compartments in 1896 and his case goes all the way to the Supreme Court which rules that it is fine to separate the races as long as separate accommodations are equal. So this is the place where separate but equal comes in.
Social Studies,"Now in theory, separate accommodations for whites and blacks were supposed to be equal, in reality they almost never were and in fact it was the very separation itself that implied the inequality and that is what the NAACP is going to argue in the Brown versus Board of Education case in 1954 which overturns this doctrine of separate but equal. But in-between this period of 1877 and 1954 Jim Crow laws were on the books in all of the Southern states."
Social Studies,"But I don't want you to come away thinking that things were terrible in the South and that the North was a racial utopia even though segregation laws and violence such as lynching to enforce segregation laws existed mainly in the South, de facto segregation and widespread racial prejudice also existed in the North particularly in housing and job discrimination."
Social Studies,"And of course, 1954, the Brown versus Board of Education decision didn't end segregation or end racial prejudice in the United States, it's enforcing the end of segregation and enforcing the end of some of these de facto forms of segregation and racial prejudice in the North that will be the real focus of the Civil Rights Movement."
Social Studies,"So I think the real tragedy of the Jim Crow era was that it didn't have to be this way, in fact, it was just in this presidential election of 1876 that the Federal government more or less gave up on protecting the rights of African Americans. It's interesting to imagine what life in the South might have been like had the Federal government not given up."
Social Studies,"Perhaps it would be very different, perhaps it would not but it's hard not to mourn the lost opportunity of reconstruction, this 12 year period where African Americans had voting rights and often served in public office. Instead, the United States doomed African American citizens in the South to another almost 100 years of second class status in our society.."
Social Studies,"And today, we're learning more about the landmark case, Plessy versus Ferguson, which asks whether separate but equal accommodations for Black and White Americans violated the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. To learn more about this case, I spoke with two experts. Jamal Greene is the Dwight Professor of Law at Columbia Law School. Earl Maltz is a Distinguished Professor of Law at Rutgers Law School."
Social Studies,"So Professor Greene, could you kind of set the stage for us in this time period? After the Civil War, what was the legal and social status of former slaves? - [Jamal] Well, of course, the Civil War ended in 1865. And it was fought in large part over the institution of chattel slavery, so slavery of, generally speaking, Black or African American slaves. And right at the end of the Civil War, the 13th Amendment was passed."
Social Studies,"And the 13th Amendment basically said that there shouldn't be any slavery or involuntary servitude in the United States. So the institution of slavery itself had ended, but the passage of the 13th Amendment did not mean that former slaves had equal rights."
Social Studies,"A number of the former states of the Confederacy, the, generally speaking, Southern states, passed a number of racially discriminatory laws immediately after the end of slavery that prevented Black Americans from participating in civil society on equal terms with Whites. For example, laws restricting the ability of Blacks to enter into and enforce contracts, restricting the ability of Blacks to own property, to sit on juries, to vote, to testify in court, and so forth."
Social Studies,"So there were a number of openly discriminatory laws. There were also laws that required Blacks to be employed on pain of having their labor forced, so ways of essentially re-instituting the institution of slavery. - [Kim] And these were known as the Black Codes. - [Jamal] Those were known as the Black Codes, exactly."
Social Studies,"- [Earl] In the Reconstruction period between say the late 1860s and the mid 1870s, there was a concerted effort by the federal government to improve the social status and political rights of African Americans. In 1876, there was part of the settlement of the presidential election of 1876, the federal government drew back some. But most of the so-called Redeemer movement really took off in the 1890s."
Social Studies,"I think 1891 is when the last real effort is made by the federal government to have a serious Voting Rights Act. After that, the South is pretty much under control of the people who sympathized with ex-Confederates. - [Jamal] In both Northern and Southern states, there was widespread racial segregation. So there were laws that were basically codifying long-existing social practices of segregated housing, segregated schools, and segregated public conveyances like steamships and rail cars."
Social Studies,"But much of that changed in the years immediately following the Civil War. Congress passed a number of federal laws that banned racial discrimination, particularly in contracting and in housing. Quite significantly, in addition to the actual federal laws that Congress passed, the country passed and ratified the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So I think one thing that is very hard for me to understand and that I've seen students struggle with is you have the passage of the 14th Amendment and the 15th Amendment in 1868, 1870. And these are supposed to guarantee equal protection and citizenship and voting rights for African Americans, specifically men in the 15th Amendment. And then, you have Jim Crow."
Social Studies,"So how did we get from this moment after the Civil War where things really seem like they're looking up in terms of African American citizenship to the system of Jim Crow that's going to persist into the 1960s and 70s. - [Jamal] The Civil War did not end racism. It simply ended slavery. And so, we're still living in a racist society in which residential and school segregation remained both in Southern states and in Northern states notwithstanding the Civil Rights Amendments."
Social Studies,"And in Southern states, Reconstruction, the process of trying to bring former slaves fully into civil society, was enforced by the presence of federal troops in Southern states on the theory, the very well-founded theory, that states that had just gone to war in order to perpetuate the institution of slavery were not going to willingly adopt equal rights for the former slaves that they had just been holding in bondage."
Social Studies,"And so, there was a federal military occupation of a number of former Confederate states for a good decade plus after the Civil War really ending in 1877. - [Earl] And at that point, again through the Redeemer movement, people who were the White power structure, most of which had sympathized with the Secessionist Movement, the White power structure and its successors took power back in the beginning and mid 1870s in the Southern states. And as part of their campaign, they imposed the Jim Crow system."
Social Studies,"- [Jamal] Slavery was not just about labor. It was really a system of racial hierarchy. And many in the United States remained committed to that system even after bondage itself ended. And if you don't have the political will within the Northern states to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments, you had really a retrenchment of deep racial inequality within the Southern states, but not just within the Southern states, but also within a number of Northern states as well."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So let's kind of dial into the case Plessy versus Ferguson. Who was Homer Plessy? And why did he take issue with segregation? - [Earl] Well the law that was at issue required what was in theory separate but equal accommodation of African Americans and Whites on public transportation. Homer Plessy objected to it because A, the facilities weren't really equal. And he objected to it in part because he was classified as Black, but also in general because he thought that that was demeaning."
Social Studies,"Obviously, a majority of members of the Supreme Court believed that the Southern states should have at least some leeway and to establish their the system of racial segregation. - [Jamal] And so, Plessy was in league with the railroad and with the civil rights organization that recruited him to set up a case. So he agreed with the railroad to board the White area of the railway car on a car going from New Orleans to a town called Covington. And it was agreed that the railway would ask him to leave."
Social Studies,"He would refuse. And then, he would be arrested. And once he was arrested, that would enable him to challenge the law under which he was arrested under the Constitution. The railroads didn't like this law. They didn't like this law because they didn't want to be subject to fines or liability for not properly maintaining separate cars. It was really up to the conductors to make sure that separate cars were maintained. And the conductors themselves could be fined by the state for not doing so."
Social Studies,"And they could also be fined by passengers for mistakenly putting someone in the wrong car. So the railroads didn't really wanna be bothered with this kind of law. And so, this particular railroad, Eastern Railway, was willing to agree to set up a situation to challenge the law. - [Kim] So Homer Plessy, he gets on this train and he challenges the statute. I believe he sat in a Whites-only car and announced that he was African American. And then, he was arrested."
Social Studies,"So what happened next? - [Jamal] He's arrested. And then, he is eventually charged with a crime, with a violation of the statute. And there's a fine associated with violating the state law. And his lawyers bring a claim that the law violates the Federal Constitution. So initially, it goes through the state courts of Louisiana. And then eventually, they rule against Homer Plessy in favor of the law. And then, his lawyers appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So how did the court rule? - [Jamal] In the years leading up to the case, the lawyers for Homer Plessy were quite concerned about the composition of the court because they weren't sure if they could count five votes in favor of Black civil rights. Because none of the justices on the court were considered to be particularly friends of Black Americans."
Social Studies,"- [Earl] In the civil rights cases in 1883, the court had already held that Congress lacked authority to prohibit segregation in public accommodations, which meant they viewed public accommodations as something fairly private rather than a civil right, a quasi-governmental right or a quasi-public right. And that's one of the big distinctions between the majority and the dissent in both the civil rights cases and in Plessy versus Ferguson."
Social Studies,"The court ruled that in fact that so long as the state of Louisiana maintained separate but equal facilities, they could do that, that that was not prohibited by the 14th Amendment. - [Jamal] The Supreme Court in 1896 rules seven to one that the Separate Car Act is constitutional. So a state is allowed to segregate its public conveyances, including rail cars, by race. The court denies that the Separate Car Act violates the 14th Amendment to the Constitution."
Social Studies,"What the court basically says is: look, the law says the railway cars have to be equal, even if they're separate. And all the 14th Amendment requires is that basic equality in civil rights. - [Earl] John Marshall Harlan, of course, dissented from that. I think that it's important to understand what was the actual nature of Harlan's dissent rather than the way that it is actually portrayed."
Social Studies,"Harlan is famous talking about the colorblind Constitution, but in fact, what he says is: ""With respect to civil rights common to all citizens,"" I don't have the exact language before me, ""that the Constitution which required to be colorblind."" So one of the big distinctions between the majority and the dissent is that Harlan does in fact believe that the right to use public transportation counted as a civil right, and therefore, was protected against segregation by Section 1 of the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"I wanna make that point because it's pretty clear that Harlan believed, for example, that maintenance of segregated schools would be constitutional. And it's also true that Harlan voted for to say that miscegenation laws were constitutional. - [Jamal] The dissenting judge, Justice Harlan himself a former supporter of slavery, who changed his views and eventually became known as a champion of Black civil rights. So Justice Harlan, the lone dissenter, one of the only Southern judges on the court."
Social Studies,"But the others were basically Northern, both Republican and Democrat. They didn't have strong views about race. They didn't have unusually strong views about race for their time. And they maintained this distinction between social and civil rights. It's important to understand in trying to understand the context of Plessy versus Ferguson that the Supreme Court used to distinguish between what it called civil rights and what it called social rights."
Social Studies,"Civil rights were basically rights to participate in civil society, and included rights like the right to enter into contracts, the right to buy property, the right to testify in court. The court understood social rights as something very different from that, which is really the right to do all of those things in the company of people of a different race. - [Kim] That's fascinating. So what was the effect of this ruling in Plessy versus Ferguson? - [Earl] There are two ways that you could look at it."
Social Studies,"That until 1954, the effect of the ruling was to say that the state governments were allowed to segregate their citizenry on the basis of race. That's one way you could look at it. Now one of the interesting questions is how much difference it would have made given the sort of culture of the Southern states even if the court had held that it was unconstitutional for the state to formally require segregation among the races."
Social Studies,"That is, that there were a lot of informal pressures which would have pushed toward segregation even if the court had said that the statute was unconstitutional. But we'll never know that. So in other words, the question in Plessy is not whether the federal government was going to mandate segregation, but rather whether the federal government was simply going to leave the states and their citizenry to their own devices in determining whether to segregate their public transportation and some other thing."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this concept of separate but equal is I think the most important thing that comes out of Plessy versus Ferguson, and then later will be at issue in the 20th century. So was separate ever equal in theory or in practice? - [Jamal] It was very clear at the time. And Justice Harlan says so in his dissenting opinion in Plessy that the practice of separating railway cars or any number of other public accommodations by race was not designed for the comfort of Black Americans."
Social Studies,"It was designed in order to maintain their social inferiority through legal institutions. So once you no longer have the institution of slavery, there was a felt need among many in the South to maintain the system of social relations that slavery represented. And that's what Jim Crow was all about. And everyone knew that's what Jim Crow was all about. So Jim Crow was really kind of in its infancy when Plessy versus Ferguson was decided."
Social Studies,"Laws that prevented Blacks from voting through a number of literacy requirements and property requirements and good character requirements and so forth, those kinds of laws were very much in their infancy at the time Plessy versus Ferguson was decided. And so, the whole system of segregation is really revving up in the 1890s. And the court just gives it carte blanche to continue after that."
Social Studies,"And it's important to remember that as of the 1890s, the Supreme Court had not admitted to ever having reversed one of its own decisions. Whereas your Plessy case was quite clear about this. The assumption was that once the court ruled, it was going to be an awfully long time before you could get the court to reverse itself. And that's in fact what happened. So the court does not reverse Plessy versus Ferguson until Brown versus Board of Education in 1954."
Social Studies,"And so, you had an almost 60-year period in which practices of institutionalized segregation had the blessing of the Supreme Court. - [Kim] So we've learned that in Plessy versus Ferguson, the Supreme Court took a narrow view of the Equal Protection Clause, ruling that separate but equal accommodations for White and Black Americans did not violate the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"Earl Maltz suggests that it's difficult to tell if a different outcome in Plessy versus Ferguson would have made much difference in the actions of Southern states if there was no political will to enforce integration anyway. Jamal Greene, by contrast, reminds us that segregation was just getting started at the time of the Plessy case. And this ruling by the court legitimized Jim Crow laws that would continue to spread for nearly 60 years."

Social Studies,And not until nearly the turn of the 20th century did the superintendent of the US Census declare that the frontier was now closed. US territories stretched all the way to the Pacific Ocean. We've talked a bit about what caused people to move west and what effects the immigration of millions of non-native people west of the Mississippi had on that region and on the United States as a whole before and during the Civil War.
Social Studies,"In this video, I want to pick up the story after the Civil War and discuss how westward expansion affected the society and culture of the West at the end of the 19th century. Let's quickly review some of the causes of westward expansion that were already established by the end of the Civil War. Starting in the 1840s, Americans and European immigrants began moving west looking for farmland."
Social Studies,"And the California Gold Rush of 1849 brought people from all over the world into the region to either pan for gold or to make some money off the people who were panning for gold. The construction of the transcontinental railroad also provided many jobs for those who didn't strike it rich. The US government facilitated this westward expansion by granting millions of acres to railroad companies, making it easier to get west and to get goods from the West back East."
Social Studies,"The government also encouraged settlement through grants of 160 acres of free land to anyone willing to improve it over the course of five years. Lastly, many American migrants were convinced through cultural messaging that American civilization was divinely ordained to occupy North America from Atlantic to Pacific in an ideology known as Manifest Destiny."
Social Studies,"All of these things continued to motivate westward expansion in the years after the Civil War, but there were a few unique aspects in this era that intensified the changes wrought by westward expansion. First, the US government began to take a new approach towards its interactions with Native Americans. Instead of treating Native American tribes as independent nations, the government began to cast them as wards of the state, relics of an earlier time that had to take up American ways or face extinction."
Social Studies,"They began to confine Native Americans to reservations and classify any individual or group that refused as hostile. Another related thing that changed was that after the Civil War, the US Army could apply its full might to subduing the West through a series of conflicts with Native Americans called the Indian Wars."
Social Studies,"One thing I find fascinating about these conflicts was that many of the generals who led campaigns in the Indian Wars were former Union generals who had fought to end slavery in the South during the Civil War, including Oliver O. Howard, the commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau. What do you think their approach to Native Americans versus African Americans says about how they conceived of American citizenship in this time period? The effects of westward expansion also intensified after the Civil War."
Social Studies,"As we've already mentioned, one effect of Americans' westward push was violence against Native Americans and other minorities. The US Army forced Native Americans onto reservations or hunted them down when Native Americans attempted to prevent white settlers from encroaching on those reservations, like when gold was discovered on the Sioux reservation in the Black Hills of South Dakota."
Social Studies,"The US Army also prevented Native Americans from engaging in rituals like The Ghost Dance, which they feared would kindle resistance among Native Americans. In 1890, an Army regiment disarmed a Lakota Sioux encampment near Wounded Knee Creek. And while the Lakotas were giving up their weapons, one rifle accidentally discharged. The US Army then massacred somewhere between 200 and 300 men, women, and children."
Social Studies,"Other minorities in the West were also subject to racial violence including Mexican Americans, who were driven off their lands by force, and Chinese immigrants, who were targeted in race riots throughout California. Minorities also faced the loss of their land and their cultures in the West. The most significant land loss came as a result of the Dawes Act of 1887."
Social Studies,"The Dawes Act sought to force Native Americans to stop living communally and take up American culture and farming by splitting up reservations and awarding 160 acres of land to each head of household, sort of like the Homestead Act. But unlike the Homestead Act, Native Americans had to improve the land and behave like whites for 25 years to get title and American citizenship, not just five."
Social Studies,"And due to corruption in administering this policy, Native Americans were placed on the worst land for farming, or their land allotments were given to white settlers instead. All in all, the Dawes Act resulted in the loss of over 80 million acres of Native American land. Similarly, government agents turned a deaf ear towards the claims of Mexican Americans whose land was claimed by white settlers even though Mexican Americans had been US citizens since the end of the Mexican War."
Social Studies,"The same impulse to force Native Americans to assimilate into American living patterns also drove the creation of Indian boarding schools in this era. Native children were removed from their homes and sent to boarding schools like the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. There they would be forced to cut off their long hair, change into American-style clothing, and take up new American-sounding names. These schools lasted until the 1970s."
Social Studies,"Chinese immigrants, by contrast, were judged incapable of assimilation. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, the first immigration restriction to prevent all members of an ethnic group from entering the United States. Restrictions on Chinese immigration would not be completely abolished until 1965. There were also some far-reaching environmental transformations resulting from westward expansion. One of these was the near extinction of the American bison, also known as the buffalo."
Social Studies,"Huge herds of buffalo roamed the American West for all of recorded history in the area. Plains Indians had over-hunted them in the years before large-scale immigration to the West, but the coming of the railroad signed the buffalos' death warrant. There were about 15 million buffalo in the West at the end of the Civil War, but less than 20 years later there were fewer than 1,000 buffalo remaining due to whites hunting them for sport or clearing them from rail lines."
Social Studies,"This left Plains Indians, who depended on the buffalo for meat and clothing, in a state of near-starvation, making it even more difficult for them to resist being forced onto reservations. Plains Indians were also affected by the development of barbed wire in this era, which white settlers used to fence off what had been communal grazing lands. This was also a hardship for cowboys, who once had driven herds of cattle to railroad depots over long stretches of open range."
Social Studies,"By the end of the 19th century, there was little to no open range left at all. Lastly, the spread of settlers into the arid western part of the Great Plains led to massive irrigation projects in order to supply lands that weren't really naturally suited to farming with water. This meant damming and diverting rivers and the use of farming techniques that would later contribute to the ravages of the Dust Bowl in the 1930s."
Social Studies,"Who has access to water and for what purposes is still a major source of conflict in the American West. So as we look forward into the 20th century from our vantage point here at the edge of the American Frontier, let's take some time to think about what the story of westward expansion tells us about how Americans thought about citizenship and access to resources in this time period."
Social Studies,How will those ideas influence the United States once it begins to step on the world stage and look for new frontiers outside of North America?.
Social Studies,"Have you ever wondered why the United States has islands in the middle of the Pacific? This is thousands of miles from the mainland of the United States. So what's the deal? Did the United States just want access to somewhere to get a tan and maybe buy some pineapple? In this video I want to talk about the very unique, historical circumstances under which the United States acquired a bunch of territory outside of the borders of the lower 48 states."
Social Studies,"Or how, in other words, the United States became an empire. And empire, or imperialism, is the practice of having political or economic control over a territory that is outside the boundaries of your nation. So when did this happen and why did this happen? Let me give you a little background on the run up to the United States becoming an empire."
Social Studies,"So the Civil War ends in 1865, and while that is a conflict just within the United States, right, the definition of civil war, the Civil War has kind of an interesting effect on the United States' economy because for the the course of the Civil War the North really ramped up their industrial production to win the war. So they build railroad tracks and they have factories that help them build the armaments that are gonna help them with victory in the war."
Social Studies,"Well, after the war, all these factories, all these railroads still exist, and they're turned to different purposes. So over the course of the late 19th century from the end of the Civil War, really up until even 1900 and beyond, the United States becomes the leading industrial power in the world. So they make more stuff than anybody else, and this is one of the reasons why so many immigrants are flocking to the United States in this time period, because there are jobs in factories."
Social Studies,"But even though the U.S. was acknowledged as this great industrial power, it was not really acknowledged as a world military power. The number one power in the world at this time is England. This is the end of the Victorian Era. None of the nations of Europe think of the United States as an important power in the world. If you were a diplomat from France and you got a diplomatic posting to Washington D.C., that would be like getting a diplomatic posting on the moon. There is nothing going on there."
Social Studies,"Nobody's interested. You'd much rather be in Vienna or London. But another reason why the nations of Europe are such important world powers is because of their own investment in imperialism. So let me show you a map of the world in 1914, which is kind of after this age of imperialism, but it gives you an idea of how much territory Europe had gobbled up in this time period."
Social Studies,"So this is the rest of the world in this time period, and we're talking about kind of the period from about 1880 to 1900, and in this time period the powers of Europe really competed with each other to take over territories in the rest of the world. And these would have been developing nations, nations that did not have the firepower to compete with Europe, and they were generally nations with a lot of natural resources. So in the mid-19th century, there'd been explorers going throughout Africa."
Social Studies,"This is the period of Dr. Livingstone, I presume, and Dr. Livingstone reports back to England that there is a lot of stuff in Africa. We're talkin' about diamonds and gold and rubber, and elsewhere in the world, in India there's tea. And so in the 1880s, 1890s, Europe scrambles for territorial control of Africa and you see England here in South Africa, and France up here in northwest Africa, and then of course you've got England in India and Australia and they're even fighting for influence in China."
Social Studies,"And they had two main reasons for wanting these colonies abroad. One is, as we said, their natural resources, so they can take all the raw materials, the unfinished goods, to run the empire and then they can take that back up to Europe and process it. So it's a cheap source of stuff for their industrial production."
Social Studies,"The other thing they want is markets, so all of these territories, all of these colonies, have people in them who can buy the products from the European nations, and as their factories produce more and more stuff, they needed more and more people to buy those things or they're going to stagnate economically. So this is where the United States comes in. So in the late 19th century the U.S. has become this leading industrial power."
Social Studies,"They feel like they're not getting any respect from Europe for being pretty big dogs, but they also start looking at this scramble for Africa, this scramble for colonies in the world, and they think maybe the United States should get in on this game, and they have a couple of reasons for doing this. One of the reasons for doing this is the idea of expanding the frontier. So in the late 19th century, there was a pretty famous historian by the name of Frederick Jackson Turner."
Social Studies,"And what Turner has to say really troubles a lot of people. He says manifest destiny is done. So manifest destiny you'll recall, is this idea that God wanted the United States to occupy the North American continent from Atlantic to Pacific. As of 1890, the census showed that there was pretty much even population distribution all the way to the Pacific Ocean, so this process of conquering the frontier that many white Americans thought was really crucial to the American spirit, was over."
Social Studies,So what is the United States going to do? Culturally they pride themselves on being a pioneering people. But along with that goes the same sort of quest for new markets that Europe is going through in the same time period.
Social Studies,"So if the United States is the world's leading industrial power, and they did that by conquering the frontier, building railroads, finding new people to sell the products of their factory to, what's going to happen if they have nowhere else to expand? Relentless expansion is kind of the backbone of American capitalism. And so people started to worry that if expansion is done, then the American industrial project is going to falter with no new markets to conquer."
Social Studies,"All right, so those are the economic and cultural explanations for why the United States became interested in being an imperial power at the end of the 19th century. There are also some military explanations, so let me take you back to a map of the Pacific. So in 1890, this man named Alfred Thayer Mahan published a book called The Influence of Sea Power Upon History."
Social Studies,"And Mahan's thesis was that all the great nations of history since time immemorial had gotten their greatness through a domination of the seas. So he says that if the United States really wants to be a world power going forward, they're going to have to make some serious investments in their navy. He says first they're going to have to build a really powerful naval fleet, which has never really been the bread and butter of America's military."
Social Studies,"Up until this point, the United States' navy was like five leaky boats. So he says they have to build a powerful navy and that you should consider putting a canal somewhere across Central America so that if a ship is in the Atlantic it doesn't have to go all the way around South America to get to the Pacific. It can just cut this corner here. And the last thing that Mahan says is that the U.S."
Social Studies,"is going to need friendly ports all over the world so that this navy can dock places, refuel, take on new supplies, because if your ports are only on the edges of the United States, it could take you days and days and days to make it all the way over to Asia. So Mahan says we need good harbors along the way. And you know what's a really great harbor? Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. It's one of the best harbors in the world. And basically in the future the U.S. government is going to to do exactly what Mahan says."
Social Studies,"In between 1890 and 1914, the United States increases their investment in the navy by a power of seven. It's $22 million dollars only in 1890. By 1914 they're putting $140 million dollars a year into their navy. And they will move forward with this plan to build a canal somewhere in Central America. Hint, hint, it might be in Panama. And they will annex ports all over the Pacific, and also in the Caribbean, to take care of their new powerful navy. So in the late 19th century, the U.S."
Social Studies,is really poised to enter into world politics as a major world power. In the next video I'll talk about the Spanish American War of 1898 and how that led the United States to become an empire..
Social Studies,"The rise of big business had also led to practices that limited competition, like monopolies and price fixing. Starting in the 1890s a number of reformers began to advocate for remedies to these social problems. They were known as the Progressives. This era of reform, which lasted through the 1920s, has come to be known as the Progressive Era. But the difficult thing about the Progressive Era was that these reformers worked on all sorts of different things."
Social Studies,"There were muckrakers, which were journalists, writers, and photographers who tried to expose corruption or unsanitary factory practices. There were politicians who tried to reign in big businesses and protect consumers. There were conservationists who tried to preserve national parks and wilderness from exploitation. And there many influential female reformers who tried to help women, children, and immigrants achieve better working and living conditions."
Social Studies,"So clearly Progressives didn't all share the same goals or advocate for the same solutions to problems. How can we even compare the goals and effects of the Progressive reformers when they were so diverse? Let's start by taking a look at some of the goals and achievements of the Progressives. Now, I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail about individual reformers or pieces of legislation here."
Social Studies,"What I'm interested in doing is taking a birds eye view of the kinds of reforms that Progressives pursued during this time period. First, there were those who advocated for sanitation and consumer protections like Upton Sinclair, whose novel The Jungle exposed the unsanitary conditions in factories that made food products. The outrage that book generated led to the passage of laws like the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Then there were the Progressives who fought for protections for workers."
Social Studies,"They pushed for an eight hour workday and for safer conditions for workers, along with the right for workers to bargain collectively through unions. Along with those reforms were others aimed at advancing the rights of women and children, including limiting child labor, promoting access to birth control, and granting women the right to vote through the 19th Amendment. Many of the Progressive reformers were interested in reining in the excesses of big business."
Social Studies,"Politicians, like President Teddy Roosevelt, went after trusts and monopolies for stifling competition and fixing prices. Another avenue of reform was aimed at limiting political corruption, particularly city political machines that were dominated by party bosses. One victory in this arena was the passage of the 17th Amendment, which provided for the popular election of senators. Lastly, there was a push for moral reform to make society more orderly and humane."
Social Studies,"The major achievement of these reformers was the passage of the 18th Amendment, which prohibited the sale or consumption of alcohol. Okay, so now that we've done a brief survey of what the Progressives were up to, let's think about what aspects these reformers had in common with each other, and where they differed with or contradicted each other. So this might sound a little obvious, but one thing that united the Progressives was that they believed in progress."
Social Studies,"That is, they thought it was possible to improve society and to make people better human beings. This is worth mentioning just because not everyone felt that this was possible. Many of the opponents of the Progressives saw human nature as fixed and a society with vast inequalities of wealth and opportunity is just an inevitable consequence of industrialization. A second shared belief was that it was the role of government to step in and fix these social problems."
Social Studies,"This was a big departure from the laissez-faire or hands off approach of the Gilded Age. In that era, attempting to improve sanitation or morality would have been considered work for private charities or voluntary associations to take on. But the Progressives thought that the problems they were trying to solve were too big for that approach. And they sought out the help of local, state, and federal government to implement their measures."
Social Studies,They campaigned for laws and constitutional amendments to bring about change. So they really began a debate over whether or to what extent the government should take an active role in the welfare of its citizens that would continue into the Great Depression. But the Progressive Movement was also riddled with divisions and internal contradictions. One of these was around voting rights.
Social Studies,"The Progressives expanded democracy by winning the right to vote for women, but they also advocated for restricting the vote to who they considered good voters. White, educated, native-born people. They worked to impose literacy tests and residency requirements in the North, and made no effort to challenge Jim Crow Laws preventing African Americans from voting in the South. Progressives were also divided on the issue of immigration."
Social Studies,"Although a few Progressives championed the rights of immigrants and respect for immigrant's culture like Hull-House founder, Jane Addams, most Progressives thought the only way forward for immigrants was complete assimilation into American culture. They also supported restrictions on the entry of immigrants they considered undesirable, like those from Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia, and Mexico."
Social Studies,"These beliefs around who was fit to vote or to be an American citizen derived from the flawed racial science of the day, which categorized white Anglo-Saxons as the most evolved race, and everyone else falling somewhere along a continuum of less evolved peoples. With the exception of African American activists, like Ida B. Wells, Progressive reformers supported segregation and pretty much turned a blind eye towards the working and living conditions of African Americans."
Social Studies,"Some Progressives even advocated eugenics, a plan to improve the American gene pool by encouraging native white women to have more babies, and discouraging undesirables from reproducing, sometimes through forced sterilizations."
Social Studies,So taking these uniting and dividing factors into consideration what conclusions can we come to about the goals and effects of the Progressive reform movement? I think it's safe to say that the Progressives wanted to improve society and find a remedy for the social problems caused by industrialization and urbanization. And that they wanted to do so through government intervention. But their goals were also limited.
Social Studies,"They only wanted these improvements for those they deemed worthy to participate in American society. As for how effective their reforms were at solving the problems of industrialization and urbanization, they did succeed in curbing some of the worst problems of corruption, sanitation, and exploitation. But we would also need to look ahead to the '20s and '30s to see how much things really changed. Spoiler alert, this booming era of industry was about to end with a crash.."
Social Studies,"And it was in November of 1914 that the British declared the entire North Sea area a war zone. Which essentially is telling any ship, come here at your own risk. You might be destroyed, and especially you're not allowed to carry any contraband. But they included food as a contraband. So this essentially began the blockade of Germany and Austria-Hungary. So this is the blockade of the Central Powers. And this had major implications for the war. It continued throughout the entire war."
Social Studies,"It essentially caused the Germans, or the Central Powers, especially the Germans and the Austrians to have to ration food. We're talking about 1,000 calories a day. You could look at the number of calories in your average Big Mac and think about how little food that was. And there's many estimates of what that caused. That obviously made it hard for the Central Powers to get war munitions and things like that. But it also made it very difficult for them to get food."
Social Studies,"And there are estimates that this rationing, this inability to get food, lead to malnutrition, even led to starvation. And there's estimates that this might have led to in excess of 400,000 civilian deaths either directly or indirectly due to malnutrition or starvation amongst the Central Powers. So this was a pretty serious tactic that was undertaken. Now, the Germans did not have as dominant of a Navy."
Social Studies,"Most of their Navy was actually focused right off of the coast of Germany, right around there, in the North Sea. But they also wanted to disrupt trade with the British. They recognized the British Isles, they're islands. They're dependent on trade for food and for supplies. So in 1915 in February, the Germans declared the seas around the British Isles, they declared this whole area, a war zone. Similarly, they declared that a war zone as well."
Social Studies,"And because their surface fleet was concentrated right over here, the way that they would enforce that, they would essentially try to keep people from trading with the British Isles is through submarine warfare. And World War I is the first time that submarine warfare becomes a significant factor. We're talking about very primitive submarines. But we are talking about these vessels that could go underwater and essentially send torpedoes into boats."
Social Studies,"Now, thinking about that as a backdrop, we now forward to May of 1915. So let's go to May of 1915. You have the passenger liner, the RMS Lusitania. And RMS literally stands for Royal Mail Ship because it carried some mail. It's a big ship. If you've ever seen the movie Titanic, think of a ship like that. And it was setting sail from New York to Liverpool, England. And it was apparently a passenger ship, but it was also carrying cargo."
Social Studies,"But the Germans, they said, look, this could be fair game for us, especially if it's carrying munitions, especially if it's a British ship. And in the advertisement that was in New York for the Lusitania that was going to leave on May 1, 1915, the German embassy actually placed an advertisement. And this is worth reading. They wrote, ""Notice, travelers intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage are reminded that a state of war exists between Germany and her allies and Great Britain and her allies."
Social Studies,"That the zone of war includes the water adjacent to the British Isles. That in accordance with formal notice given by the Imperial German government, vessels flying the flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies, are liable to destruction in those waters. And that travelers sailing in the war zone on ships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk. From the Imperial German embassy."" And this is dated April 1915. So that's the backdrop. The Lusitania sets sail May 1, 1915."
Social Studies,"On May 7, 1915-- the number 15 keeps jumping into my brain-- on May 7, 1915, it's almost reached its destination of Liverpool. That's Liverpool right over here. It's around 10 or 15 miles off the coast of Ireland. And right there it encounters a German U boat. So this right over here is a German U boat. And that German U boat sends a torpedo into the Lusitania. Now the torpedo, as you could imagine, rams into the ship. And then shortly after the torpedo hits, you have this huge explosion."
Social Studies,"And the huge explosion is actually one of those question marks of history. Now, the ship goes down, taking down with it most of its passengers. So there were 1,959 total passengers and crew. And 1,195 of them actually died. Now there were other ships that went down due to German U boats, but what was famous about this one, at least from an American history point of view, is that there were 128 Americans who also died on board."
Social Studies,"And so you could imagine, this led to a lot of people were concerned on the American side. Why did this happen? These were American civilians. And it essentially led to a harsh reprimand from Woodrow Wilson. And just as a little bit of context, once war broke out-- and war had broken not even a year before the sinking of the Lusitania-- the Americans' position was to be neutral. It did not want to enter into this European conflict."
Social Studies,"With that said, the Americans were disproportionately trading with the Allies not the Central Power. They were providing supplies, at a minimum, at a trading level. And they were providing monetary support. They were providing loans to the Allies disproportional to the Central Powers. So even though there was this formal neutrality, there was more implicit connection to the Allies. So Woodrow Wilson, he still wants to keep America out of the war at this point. So we're talking about May 1915."
Social Studies,"And so he essentially just sends a stern warning to the German empire. Says, you must apologize. You must take action to prevent this type of thing happening in the future. And the German empire actually complies. On September 9-- let me write this on the timeline. So right over here. So in May, you have the Lusitania sunk. And then in September, the Germans agree to not attack passenger ships."
Social Studies,"And so even though the sinking of the Lusitania, especially in a lot of American history classes, is often given as a trigger for America entrance into war, this whole thing happened and America stayed neutral throughout this entire period. And America wouldn't actually enter the war until April 1917. So the Lusitania was just one of many things that happened in the years running up to the war."
Social Studies,"And if we fast forward a little bit, in 1916 the next presidential election where Wilson won re-election, he ran on a platform of, he kept us out of war. So the sinking of the Lusitania was a significant event. One could argue because the Germans did not want the US to enter on the side of the Allies, it was why the Germans agreed to loosen up, at least for a couple of years, on their U boat campaigns."
Social Studies,"As we'll see, once we get into 1917, the Germans, out of desperation, start to become more aggressive on their U boat attacks again, which is one of the catalysts that the US claims drove them into World War I. But with that said, just as a little bit of context-- and oftentimes when we look back at history, it seems very cut and dry. It seems obvious. Oh yes, we had to go to war, et cetera, et cetera. I have a few quotes here from William Jennings Bryan, who was Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state."
Social Studies,"And a few of these are pretty telling. So this first one is September 1914. This was before any of the stuff happened with Lusitania, but war had broken out in Europe. And he had this message that he wrote to Woodrow Wilson to essentially advocate why we should stay out of the war and why there should be some type of mediation to try to get the war to end as opposed to just letting it run its course."
Social Studies,"And he wrote to Wilson, ""it is not likely that either side will win so complete a victory as to be able to dictate terms. And if either""-- and this is interesting and strangely foreshadowing-- ""and if either side does win such a victory, it'll probably mean preparation for another war."
Social Studies,"It would seem better to look for a more rational basis for peace."" Now, the other quotes here-- and this is the question mark around that second explosion-- William Jennings Bryan wrote, ""ships carrying contraband should be prohibited from carrying passengers. It would be like putting women and children in front of an army."" And so this is one of those big questions of history. It was known that the Lusitania was carrying light ammunition. So it was carrying a light munitions."
Social Studies,"Now, the Germans claimed that it was actually carrying heavy munitions. And to some degree, that second explosion tends to back that up. And there was all sorts of shady things about a lot of the cargo that the Lusitania was carrying, even though they claimed that it was these perishable goods. It wasn't being stored in a refrigerated part of the ship. And so there was reason to believe that it was carrying actually heavy munitions. And that second explosion seems to point in that direction as well."
Social Studies,"And then even after World War I, the British Navy actually spent multiple times trying to destroy the wreck of the Lusitania. And some people say in order to maybe get rid of some evidence that it was actually carrying far more munitions and maybe was, from the Germans' point of view, a fairer target than was actually made out. So regardless, it's a very interesting incident, not necessarily directly tied to America's entrance into World War I. But it is one of many events."
Social Studies,"And this whole idea of blockades and German U boats against civilians, this was something that was a cause of repeated concern for the Americans.."
Social Studies,"After the sinking of the Lusitania and how angered America had gotten, they said, OK, we're not going to attack passenger vessels anymore. We're only going to attack things that are definitely British, non-passenger vessels. But as we go into January 1917, the British blockade on the Central Powers was having its effect. And the Central Powers were getting desperate, in particular Germany. And so they are eager to essentially do the same to the British."
Social Studies,"Once again, go with the unrestricted submarine warfare. But the Germans knew that if they were to go back to this, that it's likely that the US would enter the war on the side of the Allies. So knowing that was likely to happen. They said, well, how could we slow the US down. And the thinking was, well, maybe we could somehow enlisted the help of Mexico which at the time was not the best terms with the United States."
Social Studies,"And so Arthur Zimmerman who was the German Foreign Secretary, the equivalent of the United States Secretary of State. The Foreign Minister, Arthur Zimmerman sends an encoded a telegram to the Mexicans. And it's encoded, especially because it has to go over lines that are controlled by the Americans. And in it, he actually proposes an alliance to slow the Americans down. So this is what he wrote. So this is a coded telegram."
Social Studies,"And then, it was actually intercepted by British intelligence and decoded and then shared with the Americans, and then that was also then made public to the American public. And so this is why it's fascinating to actually read this stuff. This is January 1917. This is the Germans talking to the Mexicans. ""We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare. We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral."
Social Studies,"In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico a proposal alliance on the following basis-- make war together, make peace together, generous financial support, and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to you. You will inform the President--"" they're talking about the president of Mexico."
Social Studies,"""--of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain and add the suggestion that he should, on his own initiative, invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves. Please call the President's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make peace."
Social Studies,"Signed Zimmerman."" Now, the Mexicans, when they read this, they really didn't take it too seriously. They didn't think that they could seriously engage the US in a war. They couldn't seriously take back or occupy these territories. So they didn't really think much of it. The real effect of this telegram was to make the American public angry. They were going to go back into the unrestricted submarine warfare."
Social Studies,"And the Germans, themselves, talk about ruthless-- ""ruthless employment of our the submarines."" So when people talk about, what were the causes. What brought the US into war? The ones that are typically cited are the unrestricted submarine warfare. The sinking of the Lusitania. The Zimmerman telegram that was trying to get Mexico to somehow get into a war with the US and reclaim these territories."
Social Studies,"And as we'll see, a few months after this, the US actually does declare war on Germany and enter into World War I.."
Social Studies,"And April 4, Congress passes the resolution to declare war. And then the President approves it on April 6. So by early April, the United States was at war with Germany. Which is a good time to start thinking about, why did all of this happen. Now, the things that are typically cited, and these are the things that are inflamed public opinion in the US and that many of which were cited by President Woodrow Wilson."
Social Studies,"And in this tutorial that this is part of on khanacademy.org, I put the entire text of his speech, which I highly recommend reading to see all of the things the President Wilson cited in his speech. But just as a summary of that, the things that tend to get cited most often are the unrestricted submarine warfare on the part of Germany. And particular cases or the most cited example of that is the sinking of the Lusitania. The Germans had stopped doing that for a little under two years."
Social Studies,"But then, as we enter into 1917, they began doing it again. And it also made the Americans quite angry to realize that the Germans were trying to incite the Mexicans against them. So you have the Zimmerman telegram. Zimmerman telegram is also a reason that the Wilson administration, and why people in general, were fairly angry about things. Now, on top of that, there were atrocities committed by the Germans in their march through Belgium as they were trying to execute on the Schlieffen Plan."
Social Studies,"So Belgian atrocities. And these were earlier in the war in 1914, which immediately made many Americans not like what's going on. Belgian atrocities. And to put on top of that, the British were able to leverage the Belgian atrocities to fairly, to execute a fairly effective propaganda campaign in America. Now on top of that-- and this is something that Wilson speaks very strongly about in his speech-- is the notion of fighting for democracy."
Social Studies,"And what you have here, in the First World War, the Central Powers. You're talking about the German Empire, you're talking about the Austro-Hungarians. These are monarchies. These are emperors who are controlling it. And even though the UK, the United Kingdom, was nominally a kingdom, it was really a democracy. At least for those who could vote. We're not talking about the entire British Empire. So UK is functionally a democracy, democratic. And so was the Third French Republic. And so was France."
Social Studies,"So there's this argument that the US is fighting for the representation of people. Now, there is a more cynical argument that some people have made. And I think it's reasonable to give that to due time. And one of the cynical arguments, or more cynical arguments, is that the US had close financial and trade ties to Britain, not to mention cultural ties. Financial ties to the British. On top of that, you had very successful British propaganda."
Social Studies,"One, talking about the atrocities in Belgium, which did actually happen. But the British were able to exploit this as a propaganda machine. Successful propaganda. But they also spread rumors that after the sinking of the Lusitania that the Germans had their school children celebrating. And these were all made up propaganda. And then, more cynical view of why the US entered the war-- and this is true of probably most wars-- is that there was a lot of lobbying on the part of war profiteers."
Social Studies,"In fact, in ""Little Orphan Annie,"" Daddy Warbucks, the name, the reason why his last name is Warbucks is because he made his fortune as a war profiteer during World War I. And war profiteers, these are people who might be selling arms to the Allies. Or who might sell arms to the US government if the US were to get into a war that might somehow supply the troops. And it includes, potentially, folks on Wall Street. There were significant lending to the Allies, and mainly the Allies, not the Central Power."
Social Studies,"And so the view is if the Allies win, those loans are going to be made good. And I had the entire text of the speech from Senator George Norris who was one of five senators, or sorry, one of six senators to vote against the resolution to go to war. There were 50 representatives who also voted against it. This is a little excerpt but also in this tutorial, I have the full text of his speech."
Social Studies,"And I highly, highly, highly recommend reading that along with Wilson's text of his speech to Congress in his war message. But I'll just read this part because it does, I think, point out that the US, from the beginning, did have biases that were more pro-British. And so this is part of his speech."
Social Studies,"""The reason given by the President in asking Congress to declare war against Germany is that the German government has declared certain war zones, within which by the use of submarines, she sinks, without notice, American ships and destroys American lives. The first war zone was declared by Great Britain. She gave us and the world notice of it on the 4th day of November 1914. The zone became effective November 5, 1914. This zone, so declared by Great Britain, covered the whole of the North Sea."
Social Studies,"The first German war zone was declared on the 4th day of February, 1915, just three months after the British war zone was declared. Germany gave 15 days notice of the establishment of her zone, which became effective on the 18th day of February, 1915. The German war zone cover the English Channel and the high seawaters around the British Isles. It is unnecessary to cite authority to show that both of these orders declaring military zones were illegal and contrary to international law."
Social Studies,"It is sufficient to say that our government has officially declared both of them to be illegal and has officially protested against both of them. The only difference is that, in the case of Germany we have persisted in our protest, while in the case of England, we have submitted."" And I encourage you, once again, to read the text of both Wilson's speech and Senator Norris' speech and come up to your, with your own decisions. And it might be a little bit of both.."
Social Studies,It wasn't easy to achieve an abrupt about face from a country that was determined not to become involved in the conflict to a country that was wholly dedicated to the war effort. So the US Government swept into action to convince everyone to support the war. The new committee on pubic information churned out propaganda to convince people to war bonds and to keep soldiers well supplied with food and weapons.
Social Studies,"Propaganda campaigns strongly linked patriotism with unquestioning support of the American Government and of Capitalism. Dissenters were not just called Un-American, they were also in danger of being arrested or deported under new laws that restricted freedom of speech. For many immigrants and African Americans in this time period, the home front during World War I, offered both new opportunities and great dangers."
Social Studies,One major opportunity brought on by World War I was the prospect of better jobs for African Americans. The war slowed down immigration to about a tenth of what it had been previously. Since torpedo's made the Atlantic a dangerous place for ships. The sudden drop in immigrants and the need to produce war material led to an explosion in the number of factory jobs that were available to black workers.
Social Studies,"In the decade that surround World War I, half a million African Americans left the South and headed for Northern and Mid-Western cities in a mass exodus known as the The Great Migration. Even though black factory workers didn't enjoy anything, like the wages or privileges afforded to white workers, they still could make more money in the North than they could as share-croppers in the South. In the North they also had the right to vote and were less likely to encounter racial violence like lynching."
Social Studies,"But, racial violence, segregation, discrimination, were still prominent fixtures of black life in the North. Several of the most deadly race riots in American History happened during this period in Northern cities. Another opportunity that World War I offered to immigrants and African Americans was the ability to boost their status in society by contributing to the war effort. Many immigrants saw displays of patriotism as a way to show they were truly American and had assimilated through the melting pot."
Social Studies,"US Government appealed to immigrants specifically to show their patriotism by enlisting, participating in parades, or buying war bonds. Take a look at this propaganda poster showing immigrants passing by the Statue of Liberty. It's written in Yiddish, the language commonly spoken Eastern European Jews. And it says: You came here seeking freedom, now you must help preserve it. And it instructs them not to waste food."
Social Studies,"So, conspicuous to displays of patriotism and other efforts to help the war, were a way that immigrants could show that they were America and therefore deserve to be treated just the same as other Americans. For similar reasons, African American leaders like, W.E.B. DuBois encouraged black men to enlist for military service hoping that serving honorably in the war would help improve the status of African Americans. Just as the service of black service had done in the Civil War."
Social Studies,"This poster celebrated the accomplishments of the all black 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hell Fighters, who were the first allied soldiers to engage the Germans in combat. The French Government awarded many of them the Croix de Guerre, its medal for heroism. But, despite the hopes of DuBois and others, the war time service of African Americans didn't result in any significant Civil Right's gains during the war or when they returned home."
Social Studies,"Army units were segregated and most soldiers were confined to menial duties. The Wilson Administration didn't even allow black soldiers to participate in victory parades at the end of the war. At home, failure to fully embrace American patriotism was sharply punished. In 1917 and 1918 Congress passed the Espionage Act which made it a crime to spy, interfere with the draft, or make false statements about the military. And the Sedition Act, which criminalized statements critical of the government."
Social Studies,"These laws were especially dangerous for immigrants who were more likely to advocate for Socialism and for labor unions, which were by their vary nature, a critique of the American Economic System. Thousands of people were arrested as a result of these laws for doing things like publishing newspapers or handing out pamphlets. German immigrants faced particular discriminations since they were suspected of sympathizing with, or colluding with the enemy."
Social Studies,The push for a unified American public during the war also led to new immigration restrictions. In 1917 Congress required that immigrants pass a literacy test and after the war Congress would pass a series of new laws establishing ethnic quotas among immigrants which heavily discriminated against the new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.
Social Studies,These laws were partly motivated by fears that radicals sympathetic to the Russian Revolution in which Communists took control of the Russian Government were part of a global conspiracy to undermine capitalism. There were a series of labor strikes in 1919 that seemed to confirm this suspicion leading to a crackdown on labor unions and Socialist organizations known as the Red Scare. Red was the color of the Russian Communists.
Social Studies,"Thousands more people were arrested as possible radicals and many immigrants were deported. So, World War I and the United State's response to it at home caused huge changes in the flow of people to and within the United States. The dangers of war slowed what had been a tidal wave of immigrants from Europe down to just a trickle. And the economic opportunities it brought in the form of war-time factory work led hundreds of thousands of African Americans to leave the South and head to Northern cities."
Social Studies,"But, restrictions on civil liberties and fear that immigrants might be importing radical ideas from abroad led many to define who was eligible to become an American more narrowly than before. Setting the stage for a series of cultural and political battles in the 1920s about what kind of society the United States should be in this new modern era.."
Social Studies,"The main argument they give is this unrestricted submarine warfare that the Germans are undertaking. You also have the fall of the Russian Empire. ... Fall of Russian Empire... You have the revolution that overthrows the Czar in February, March of 1917, and then in October, you have the Bolsheviks take over in a coup. This essentially, the Bolsheviks, once they take over, they have no interest in terms of continuing the war with Germany."
Social Studies,"So you have an armistice declared and the Russians are in the process of negotiating the terms of a treaty with the Central Powers. They're kind of negotiating the Brest-Litovsk Treaty as we speak. On top of that, you have, because the central powers don't have to focus on Russia on the eastern front anymore, they're trying to bring their, especially Germany, is trying to bring its troops back to the western front, and they want to do it before the U.S. can mobilize in any significant way."
Social Studies,"So, race on western front ... western front ... Between, essentially, can Germany get its troops and do an offensive that can put probably France out of the war before the U.S. has a chance to significantly reinforce the western front? This is essentially between German, redeploy troops from the eastern front, German troops ... troops from eastern, from eastern front versus new American troops ... versus new Americans. This is the backdrop."
Social Studies,"No one really knew what exactly was going to happen on the western front. Certain military analysts will say Germany was able to prosecute this two front war against a major empire and Russia, now they're going to be able to focus completely on the western front, Germany might be able to deal the decisive blow. Others would say the U.S. it's this emerging power, it's bringing fresh troops in, it has a major industrial capacity. The U.S. could, especially if the war were to last a good bit, the U.S."
Social Studies,"might be the decisive element for the allies. So that's the background in which President Wilson, President Woodrow Wilson on January of 1918, January 8th, gives a speech to the joint sessions of congress. This is part of the text of the speech, I'm just going to read through it, I'm not going to read the entire speech. He talks about many things, essentially; why are we in World War I, what is the moral causes of World War I, and his speech is most famous for his articulation of the ""Fourteen Points""."
Social Studies,"Let's just read into it because it really informs a lot of what happened in the Treaty of Versailles, which is essentially the peace treaty with Germany, which the U.S. ironically did not ratify, but it also lays out the tension in the Paris Peace Conferences after World War I between those who were more idealistic like Woodrow Wilson, and those who might have been a little bit more vengeful, especially against the Central Powers."
Social Studies,"Here we go, this is part of the speech: ""We enter this war because violations of right had occurred which touched us to the quick and made the life of our own people impossible unless they were corrected and the world secured once for all against their recurrence. What we demand in this war, therefore, is nothing peculiar to ourselves. it is that the world be made fit and safe to live in ..."" This is very idealistic."
Social Studies,"Remember, all these others, especially these European powers are all about who gets what land, who gets what empire, who gets to take advantage of whatever colony. ""... and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine is own institutions, be assured of justice and fair dealing by the other peoples of the world as against force and selfish aggression."
Social Studies,"All the peoples of the world are in effect partners in this interest, and for our own part, we see very clearly that unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us. The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, all we see it, is this:"" These are his Fourteen Points and I'll try to kind of give some context for each of them."
Social Studies,"The first is: ""Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view."" The context here is actually after the Bolsheviks took over, they started releasing all these secret covenants and understandings that the Russian Empire had been getting into."
Social Studies,"We've already talked about all the entanglements and the alliances that led to World War I, so this is Wilson's attempt to say, ""Hey, let's just do everything out in the open."
Social Studies,"That'll let everyone kind of know, give more transparency, what may or may not occur, based on their actions."" Number 2, ""Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants."" So no more of these British blockades, no more of this unrestricted submarine warfare, the only time we can dictate what happens in open waters is if the international community trying to decide that it wants to enforce international covenants."
Social Studies,"Number 3, ""The removal of all economic barriers and the establishment of equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance."" So essentially, it's free trade. ... free trade ..."
Social Studies,"Number 4, ""Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety."" So he's trying to undo some of this militarism, this buildup of arms that essentially allowed World War I to happen with the ferocity that it did and with the quickness with which it did."
Social Studies,"Number 5, ""A free,open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance ot the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined."" This is a big deal that probably did not make the British or the French happy."
Social Studies,"This is essentially saying self-determination, the people who are in those nations, in those states, their interests matter just as much. ""A free open-minded absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims."" This is a pretty big deal. Remember, we're kind of exiting this period of empires, most of the European powers still think that these international empires are essentially part of their prestige."
Social Studies,"Number 6, ""The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing ..."" This is still one sentence and then you put period there, semi-colon ..."
Social Studies,"And I guess he had to read that himself, "" ... And, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come ..."" Remember, they're negotiating with the Central Powers on Brest-Litovsk, "" ..."
Social Studies,"to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy."" So it's saying look, Wilson doesn't know whether the allies or the Central Powers are going to win on the western front, but they know that the Central Powers are dictating terms to Russia with Brest-Litovsk."
Social Studies,"It's like, this is going to be a test of your good will, of your comprehension of the need of this newly-emerging of state now that the Bolsheviks have taken over. Obviously at this point, you don't have the antagonism between the U.S. and the future Soviet Union that is going to emerge. They're saying give Russia a chance to be herself."
Social Studies,"Number 7, ""Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations."" This is kind of obvious. When the Germans rolled through Belgium, that's how they got to France. It was a justification that Great Britain used for entering the war, so get out of Belgium."
Social Studies,"Number 8, ""All French territories should be freed and invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest of all."" Alsace-Lorraine, we've touched on it several times. That's this region right over here."
Social Studies,"It was taken by Germany, essentially the unification of Germany during the Franco-Prussian War, which was a [unintelligible] region. This was one of the justifications, this was why France might have gone into a war with Germany, and what Germany almost wanted to be preemptive against France because they said France might want to take some of that territory back."
Social Studies,"9, ""A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality."" Hey, where do people speak Italian? 10, ""The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity of autonomous development."" This is another big deal. It's another breaking up of an empire. It's another self-determination point of the ""Fourteen Points"". Austria-Hungary, we've already said it was an empire."
Social Studies,"It included many, many, many nationalities. You have the Czechs right around there. You have the Slovacs right around there. You have the Austrians, German-speaking people, right over there. You have the Hungarians, roughly over there. You have the Slovenians roughly over there. You have the Croatians roughly over there. You have the Bosnians roughly over there. You have many, many other nationalities especially as you get close to the border with Romania and the border with the Ukraine."
Social Studies,"It's like, let these people determine, let them determine their own fate to some degree. There are all these nationalities. That was number 10. ""The freest opportunity to autonomous development."" He's not saying that they necessarily need their own states, but that they should have the opportunity to self-govern in some way."
Social Studies,"Number 11, ""Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated; occupied territories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relations of the several Balkan states to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan states should be entered into."" This is kind of laying the groundwork for the future state of Yugoslavia, which is going to be roughly over there."
Social Studies,"It's kind of the state of the southern Slavs, which is what the whole motivation [unintelligible] for assassinating Archduke Ferdinand which some would argue was kind of the spark that lit World War I. ""The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of an autonomous development ..."" Once again, self-determination."
Social Studies,"""... and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees."" So the Dardanelles, we've talked about it before, that is, that's this right over here, so that you have access between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. And we are almost there."
Social Studies,"So then you have, ""An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant."" Poland did not exist as its own state prior to World War I. Now you have Woodrow Wilson is advocating it. It will be carved out roughly of this area right over there."
Social Studies,"Then finally, point 14, ""A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike."" This is essentially, this is the point, that leads to the formation of the League of Nations. When we talk about big ideas, this is a big idea, especially back then. You have Europe who keeps getting into wars with each other."
Social Studies,"Hey, why don't we all cooperate at this middle level and we have this club of all of the nations to resolve disputes and make sure that we don't have another World War I. So, very, very, very big idealistic idea, it gets formed as an outcome of the Treaty of Versailles, which is drafted during the Paris Peace Conferences after World War I."
Social Studies,"The unfortunate thing of the League of Nations is that even though this was kind of, the idea was coming from Woodrow Wilson, the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations was not ratified by the U.S. The U.S. never entered the League of Nations, which kind of made it a little bit hollow, and the League of Nations did not have the power to stop World War II from happening only a few decades later, and would later be replaced by the United Nations. This is a really, really, really, really big idea."
Social Studies,"Because of these big ideas, Woodrow Wilson, these very idealistic ideas, everyone in Europe is talking about territory and imperialism and how do they take control of other people, take control of their resources, and now you have the American President saying it's all about self-determination. It's about making the world safe for democracy, safe for commerce, about open agreements. It's a very powerful idea."
Social Studies,"This would kind of form the basis, the more idealistic side of American Foreign Policy over the 20th Century. Some would say that there's another very cynical side that takes into account self-interest, but this is the idealistic side of American Foreign Policy, especially through the 20th Century. For this, for his work in this in this area, Woodrow Wilson wins the Nobel Prize a few years later. This right here is a picture of the Nobel Prize looks like, both sides of it."
Social Studies,"Now, just to kind of foreshadow some of the tension as we get into the Paris Peace Conference, not everyone was as idealistic. You obviously these European powers who bled much harder than the Americans did, although the Americans did contribute significant cost, or troops, to the effort and they lost many, many folks. Obviously if you're French, you had these Germans on your territory. You lost a significant fraction of your population, a huge fraction of your male population."
Social Studies,"You might be a little bit angrier. So of course, you have Georges Clemenceau who was the Prime Minister of France. He was a little bit more skeptical of the ""Fourteen Points"". This is a quote from him, he actually has many slightly entertaining quotes, ""Mr. Wilson bores me with his ""Fourteen Points"" while God Almighty has only ten."" This will kind of foreshadow some of the tension between Clemenceau and the British, and European allies on one side, and the Americans as we go to the Paris Peace Conference."
Social Studies,"They were a little bit looking out more for revenge, especially against the Germans while the Americans, especially Woodrow Wilson, was a lot more idealistic.."
Social Studies,"At this conference, you have all the parties of all the major warring parties, but the terms of peace are dictated by the winners. The major powers among the winners are led by these gentlemen right over here. This is Prime Minister Lloyd George of the UK, Vittorio Orlando of Italy, Georges Clemenceau of France, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States. They come to the Paris Peace Conference with very different outlooks of what the peace should look like."
Social Studies,"We already learned about President Wilson's ""Fourteen Points"". It was very idealistic. It talked about making the world safe for democracy, how people should determine their own fate, how we should have the self-determination, the end of empires, free trade, creating a League of Nations so that you can avoid things like World War I again. The European side was not quite as idealistic, especially the French. As you can imagine, the U.S."
Social Studies,"lost a lot of soldiers in World War I, but the French lost a significant fraction of their adult males in World War I. The ugly western front was fought in their country, so they were much more eager to make Germany pay for what it's done. The terms of the treaty with Germany, the Treaty of Versailles, and the Treaty of Versailles, it's important to note, is only one of several treaties that came out of the Paris Peace Conference."
Social Studies,"It tends to get the most attention because it was a treaty with Germany, Treaty of Versailles, and many people blame it for being part of the cause for World War II. It so humiliated Germany that it was so unacceptable, that it allowed a character like Hitler to come along and lead Germany back into war. The Treaty of Versailles was the treaty with Germany ."
Social Studies,"You have other treaties; with the Austrians and now since the Austro-Hungarian empire is being broken up, the Hungarians, the Ottomans, so on and so forth. The Treaty of Versailles did several things. First, this was kind of in line especially with the French-thinking, is it assigned the guilt to Germany ... So war guilt. War guilt for Germany. And depending on where you view, you could view this as a fairly strong thing."
Social Studies,"The argument for saying Germany is responsible for the war is in late July, early August of 1914, it didn't take much for Germany to declare war on Russia, then on France, and then invade Belgium. This was literally a matter of days. It was pretty clear that Germany was already mobilized to do this, it was eager to do this, and it did do this without much provocation. At that point, it was really just based on Russian mobilization."
Social Studies,"Those who would argue this was a little strong, would say Germany definitely played a role in the war, in maybe escalating the war, but it didn't start the war. You have the assassination of the Archduke of Franz Ferdinand, of Austro-Hungary. It was supported by elements in Serbia. Then you have the Austro-Hungarians who put out these very hard terms to the Serbians, bring these people to justice immediately, otherwise we're declaring war. It seemed like they wanted to declare war."
Social Studies,"They do declare war in July of 1914. The Russians, they don't let that be a little regional conflict, the Russians decide to start mobilizing, giving the Germans the pretext to justify their invasions, to kind of trigger this blank check that they've given the Austro-Hungarians. There's a lot of blame that could go around, but the Treaty of Versailles places it with Germany. This justifies the rationale to make Germany pay for the war. This leads to reparations ..."
Social Studies,"Reparations for Germany, which is essentially is like, ""Look, Germany, you don't have to pay the ally powers for all of their lost, especially their losses to their economy due to the fact that you are guilty of starting of this war guilt."" The reparations were not just in paper currency, the reparations were in gold, in resources. It was a very tangible reparations. It's an interesting question because these reparations are often referred to when people talked to, these were disabling reparations."
Social Studies,"They brought the German economy down. It is an open question. They were large. In modern dollars, the estimates I've seen, they were approximately $400 billion in 2013 money. That is a very, very large number, but it's not a huge number for a reasonably-sized economy like Germany. Although the economy was in bad shape at the end of World War I. It's not clear whether it by itself would have debilitated their economy."
Social Studies,"More likely, or if you were to think it's a cause, it's more the humiliation of it, that generations of Germans, many of them; 10, 20, 30 years in the future, had nothing to do with World War I, would be continuing to pay reparations to the allies. So there's a question of its impact on the economy and there's just the question of how humiliating it was. As we go, the reparations only last for about 10 years and Germany pays the equivalent of about $60 billion in modern terms, $60 billion in 2013 dollars."
Social Studies,"That's equivalent to about $5 billion in 1920 money. On top of the reparations, the allies were not interested in fighting another war with Germany, although ironically, by having very harsh terms of the treaty, they might have triggered the next war in World War II, The Rise of Hitler. Since they didn't want to have another war with Germany, they essentially limited the German army to 100,000 men, which is a very small army, as we've seen in many of the battles."
Social Studies,"You had battles with 400,000 or 500,000 men, so this is pretty much just like a police force, it's not really an army. They weren't allowed any longer to have submarines, U-boats, any kind of heavy military equipment, artillary, heavy artillary, military airplanes, battleships of any kind. It was really just a scaffold of an army so that there wouldn't be another, or they hoped there would not be, another German invasion. On top of that, Germany was stripped of territory. ... Territory ..."
Social Studies,"Some of that was directly in Germany. Poland was carved out of part of the German empire. This is the new Poland that's carved out out of the Paris Peace Conference. You see right over here, it cuts Germany into two pieces. East Prussia is still part of Germany, but it's all by itself right out here. Poland is cut out, Germany loses Alsace-Lorraine, which it captured in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian war. Mineral-rich region, the French had been eager to get it back."
Social Studies,"The Germans, actually that was one of their arguable justification why they wanted to premptively attack France, because they knew that France was eager to capture it back at some point in the future. On top of that, Germany lost its colonies. Germany was nowhere near as big of an empire as the British or even the French, it was actually a fairly new country formed in 1871, but it did have an empire."
Social Studies,"It had colonies in southwest Africa, I'll do this in darker colors, actually throughout Africa and had colonies in the Pacific. It even had a colony in China. All of that was then given over to the allies. The big idea, from the Treaty of Versailles, is that, most historians would say it was really kind of sticking it to the Germans. The Germans felt it was humilating and one could argue that it led to some of the extremism that we'll see in the next few decades of Germany."
Social Studies,"The one win that Woodrow Wilson was able to get out the Treaty of Versailles, is it did set up the League of Nations. The League of Nations. The irony here is that the US does not ratify the Treaty of Versailles because it's suspicious of these kind of extra national organizations. It actually wasn't happy with some of the territorial distribution, that it was just giving it from empire to another as opposed to having self-determination."
Social Studies,"The US was not actually a signatory, it did not actually sign the treaty. It did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Regardless of that, the Treaty of Versailles had a huge impact in sticking it to the Germans."
Social Studies,"On top of that, the Paris Peace Conference, as we've already said, had various treaties with the other central powers and some of the, and I'm not going to go into detail on what happened, especially the Ottoman Empire, that's worth another video, but the big effect on the Austro-Hungarian Empire is that it essentially is not an empire anymore. It was split up into various countries. Austria was set up as a separate country."
Social Studies,"Actually the Treaty of Versailles, in the Treaty of Versailles, Germany is forbidden from in any way merging with Austria, a German-speaking country. You have Hungary becoming a separate state. You have a new state of Czechoslovakia. You have a new state of Yugoslavia. All of a sudden, the trigger of World War I, the desire of having this unified southern Slavik state is now becoming a reality. You have Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia ... and Slovenia are taken out of the Austro-Hungarian empire."
Social Studies,"You have a major redrawing of the map of Europe. Some of these new nations here in eastern Europe are out of the old Russian empire. They were able to declare their independence, some of it short-lived before becoming satellite states or becoming part of the USSR, but they had their short-lived independence after the fall of the Russian empire."
Social Studies,"The map of Europe is dramatically changed due to the Paris Peace Conference, the Treaty of Versailles, the fall of the Russian empire, the other treaties that were outcomes of World War I.."
Social Studies,"Russia had already mobilized, but then the counter-counter-argument, well Germany gave a blank check to Austria, said it would back up Austria no matter what Austria had done. Needless to say, this applied a lot of, the Germans were not happy about being assigned the full blame of war guilt."
Social Studies,"On top of that, we've already talked about the notion that it really diminished the Treaty of Versailles, really forced the German military to be diminished dramatically down to 100,000 troops, which is really now more of a glorified police force. It was also forbidden from forming a union with Austria. You might say why Austria in particular? Well, Austria is a German-speaking state."
Social Studies,"You could imagine there's a lot of ethnic affinity or linguistic affinity between Germany and Austria, so this is not allowed according to the Treaty of Versailles. On top of that, Germany loses its colonies. These colonies we've already talked about. These are colonies in Africa, colonies in Asia and colonies in the Pacific. On top of that, we have the reparations. We have the reparations estimated at the equivalent in 2013 terms of about $450 billion US dollars."
Social Studies,"That doesn't get fully paid, but it still has a huge toll on the German economy, especially because the reparations were not just paid in currency, they were paid in resources. To make sure that they were paid in resources, the allies actually occupied the Saar region, the Saar region right over here which was coal rich, and for the next 15 years, it would ship coal to France. The allies weren't just getting paid in currency, they were getting paid in dollars."
Social Studies,"This would also have the effect as Weimar Germany, the Weimar Republic, this is the government of Germany after World War I, called the Weimar Republic because its constitution was drafted in the city of Weimar. In order to try to pay the currency portions of the reparations, left the printing presses go free, tries to convert into other currencies, and then you essentially have hyperinflation in Germany through the early '20s, through 1923."
Social Studies,"On top of that, once this hyperinflation happened and they no longer can pay the reparations, then in order to continue to extract resources from Weimar Germany, France goes ahead and occupies the Ruhr region, which is right about here. It's also very rich in steel and coal, and they began shipping the resources out which was another huge humiliation for the Germans and on top of that, it's crippling the German economy. They're taking all of the main resources out of the German economy."
Social Studies,"This happened in 1923 as well. The combined effect of one, just the humiliation of World War I, the shipping away of resources, now this occupation of the Ruhr region which was never even part of the already bad Treaty of Versailles, from the German's point of view, this helped bring support for fairly more and more extreme parties in Germany."
Social Studies,"As you go into the end of 1923, it gave some energy for Hitler's, at the time fairly small national socialist or their Nazis, to attempt a coup d'etat of the government, attempt their Beer Hall Putsch. It ends up failing, but does give a lot of energy to what was before a very marginalized, or very small party, because of this occupation, it allows that party to grow by a significant amount. On top of that, let's talk about the actual territorial losses, all of the territorial losses."
Social Studies,"You have this little region up here, the north part of east Prussia, at first becomes a French protector according to the Treaty of Versailles, but it's later taken over by Lithuania. We've already talked about this whole region of Germany, of the former German empire that's carved away in order to give it to the new state of Poland. Most of Poland is carved out of the former Russian empire, part is carved out of the former German empire and also part is carved out of the former Austro-Hungarian empire."
Social Studies,"Then you have this region right here inside [Lejon], part of it goes to Poland, part of it goes to Czechoslovakia. You have the famous Alsace Lorraine region right over here, had been a cause of contention between Germany and France for many, many, many years. Now this goes back to France. You have a little piece right over here that goes to Belgium, and then you have the north [slushig] region, goes to Denmark."
Social Studies,"On top of that, as you can imagine, the diminished troops, the taking resources away, France really wanted to cripple Germany's ability to be able to invade at any future point in time, but on top of that, they also set up a demilitarized zone in the Rhineland. The Rhineland is included both ... The demilitarized zone included the west bank of the Rhine River, all of Germany that was west of the Rhine River, so this entire region right over here, and then it was also occupied by the allies."
Social Studies,"Germany was also forbidden from militarizing or mobilizing troops anywhere 50 km east of the Rhine River. East of the Rhine River as well. So, you see going out of Treaty of Versailles, every attempt was made to attempt to cripple Germany's war-making abilities. They were forbidden from trading in arms and they couldn't have a lot of many types of offensive weapons. It really was to try to prevent Germany from being able to do what they did in World War I."
Social Studies,"As we see, in a large degree, it really was maybe a catalyst for giving energy to more extreme elements in Germany and would be one of the things pointing to for Germany's involvement in World War II.."
Social Studies,"It was the beginning of a new modern era. We've talked in other videos about the economic opportunities that the cities provided for both international immigrants and internal migrants, like the half a million African Americans who left the South in the years surrounding World War I in search of a better life in the North."
Social Studies,"Although factory jobs were subject to dangerous working conditions and wages were low, for both immigrants and Southern African Americans, the pay and the standard of living was usually an improvement on their previous circumstances. The transition to life in the modern industrial city also offered new opportunities for women. With the rise of big corporations doing business across time zones and countries, there was an increasing need for clerical workers, like secretaries and typists."
Social Studies,"White women began to take on these roles. And by the end of the 1920s, about 25% of women worked outside the home. Women also began to fill the ranks in employment categories that were beginning to be defined as female professions, like nursing and teaching. And a growing number of women continued to work even after they were married."
Social Studies,"These kinds of clerical jobs were generally closed to minority women whose options for work outside the home were limited to domestic service or agricultural labor, although some African American women began to train in segregated institutions for service in segregated institutions, for example, going to black nursing schools in order to work in black hospitals."
Social Studies,"The mass production techniques of the 1920s also meant that the price of consumer goods dropped so that average people could afford to buy appliances and even cars. People had enough disposable income to go to the theater or to an amusement park or to a speakeasy illegally selling alcohol. After the prim and proper Progressive Era and the trauma of World War I, many people embraced a carefree attitude of self-fulfillment through leisure and consumption or, in other words, having fun and buying stuff."
Social Studies,"But not everyone was thrilled with this new modern era of diverse city living. During World War I, an emphasis on 100% Americanism squelched dissenters who protested against the draft or questioned U.S. involvement in the war. Then, after the Russian Revolution, labor strikes and a series of bombings in 1919 led to fears that radical communists were threatening the country."
Social Studies,"These incidents, combined with the flawed racial pseudoscience of the day that cast all people other than those descended from Northern and Western Europeans as less evolved, led to a growing sense among native-born, white Protestants that the country was becoming less and less American. In 1915, the Ku Klux Klan experienced a resurgence in the United States that lasted for about 10 years."
Social Studies,"Unlike the Reconstruction Era KKK, in this time period, the Klan had large membership numbers in northern and western cities, and they targeted Jews and Catholics, many of whom were recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, in addition to African Americans. These fears led to the passage of new immigration restrictions in the 1920s. In 1921, Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act, which limited the number of immigrants allowed from Europe to 350,000, or about a third of pre-World War I levels."
Social Studies,"Then, in 1924, Congress limited immigration even further with the Immigration Restriction Act. This act set quotas of immigrants who could arrive from each nation. The quotas heavily favored immigrants from Northern and Western Europe and slashed the numbers of Southern and Eastern European immigrants down to as little as 1% of their pre-World War I yearly numbers. Africans from all countries were limited to just 1,000 immigrants per year, and Asians were completely barred from entry."
Social Studies,"The law did not limit the immigration of Mexicans whom western farmers relied upon for seasonal labor. Interestingly, in 1924, Congress also passed a law establishing that all Native Americans were now U.S. citizens, although they often had difficulty accessing the rights of citizenship from reservations."
Social Studies,"What do these quotas and efforts at defining the racial makeup of the United States tell us about who was considered eligible to be part of the American people in the 1920s? As we move forward into talking about the Great Depression and World War II, keep thinking about the ways that citizenship is defined and how that definition changes over time.."
Social Studies,It is really just a think about how did things get started. Or what happened in the lead up? And to start I am actually going to focus on Asia and the Pacific. Which probably doesn't get enough attention when we look at it from a western point of view But if we go back even to the early 1900s. Japan is becoming more and more militaristic. More and more nationalistic. In the early 1900s it had already occupied... It had already occupied Korea as of 1910. and in 1931 it invades Manchuria.
Social Studies,"It invades Manchuria. So this right over here, this is in 1931. And it installs a puppet state, the puppet state of Manchukuo. And when we call something a puppet state, it means that there is a government there. And they kind of pretend to be in charge. But they're really controlled like a puppet by someone else. And in this case it is the Empire of Japan. And we do remember what is happening in China in the 1930s. China is embroiled in a civil war. So there is a civil war going on in China."
Social Studies,"And that civil war is between the Nationalists, the Kuomintang and the Communists versus the Communists The Communists led by Mao Zedong. The Kuomintang led by general Chiang Kai-shek. And so they're in the midst of the civil war. So you can imagine Imperial Japan is taking advantage of this to take more and more control  over parts of China And that continues through the 30s until we get to 1937. And in 1937 the Japanese use some pretext with, you know, kind of a false flag, kind of..."
Social Studies,"well, I won't go into the depths of what started it kind of this Marco-Polo Bridge Incident But it uses that as justifications to kind of have an all-out war with China so 1937...you have all-out war and this is often referred to as  the Second Sino-Japanese War ...Sino-Japanese War Many historians actually would even consider  this the beginning of World War II."
Social Studies,"While, some of them say, ok this is the beginning of the Asian Theater of World War II of the all-out war between Japan and China, but it isn't until Germany invades Poland  in 1939 that you truly have the formal beginning, so to speak, of World War II."
Social Studies,"Regardless of whether you consider this the formal beginning or not, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and it's called the second because there was another Sino-Japanese War in the late 1800s that was called the First Sino-Japanese War, this is incredibly, incredibly brutal and incredibly bloody a lot of civilians affected we could do a whole series of videos just on that But at this point it does become all-out war and this causes the civil war  to take a back seat to fighting off the aggressor  of Japan in 1937."
Social Studies,"So that lays a foundation for what's happening  in The Pacific, in the run-up to World War II. And now let's also remind ourselves  what's happening... what's happening in Europe. As we go through the 1930s Hitler's Germany, the Nazi Party, is getting more and more militaristic. So this is Nazi Germany... Nazi Germany right over here. They're allied with Benito Mussolini's Italy. They're both extremely nationalistic; they both do not like the Communists, at all You might remember, that in 1938..."
Social Studies,"1938, you have the Anschluss, which I'm sure I'm mispronouncing, and you also have the takeover  of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. So the Anschluss was the unification with Austria and then you have the Germans taking over the of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and this is kind of the famous, you know, the rest of the, what will be called the Allied Powers kind of say, ""Okay, yeah, okay maybe Hitler's  just going to just do that... well we don't want to start another war."
Social Studies,"We still all remember World War I; it was really horrible. And so they kind of appease Hitler and he's able to, kind of, satisfy his aggression. so in 1938 you have Austria, Austria and the Sudetenland ...and the Sudetenland..."
Social Studies,"are taken over,  are taken over by Germany and then as you go into 1939, as you go into 1939 in March they're able to take over all of Czechoslovakia they're able to take over all of Czechoslovakia and once again the Allies are kind of, they're feeling very uncomfortable, they kind of, have seen something like this before they would like to push back, but they still are, kind of, are not feeling good  about starting another World War so they're hoping that maybe Germany stops there."
Social Studies,"So let me write this down... So all of Czechoslovakia... ...Czechoslovakia... is taken over by the Germans. This is in March of 1939. And then in August you have the Germans, and this is really in preparation for, what you could guess is about to happen, for the all-out war that's about to happen the Germans don't want to fight  the Soviets right out the gate, as we will see, and as you might know, they do eventually take on the Soviet Union, but in 1939 they get into a pact with  the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"And so this is, they sign the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union, this is in August, which is essentially  mutual non-aggression ""Hey, you know, you do what you need to do, we know what we need to do."" and they secretly started saying ""Okay were gonna, all the countries out here, we're going to create these  spheres of influence where Germany can take, uh, control of part of it and the Soviet Union, and Stalin is in charge  of the Soviet Union at this point, can take over other parts of it."
Social Studies,"And then that leads us to the formal start where in September, let me write this in a different color... so September of 1939, on September 1st, Germany invades Poland Germany invades Poland on September 1st, which is generally considered  the beginning of World War II. and then you have the Great Britain and France declares war on Germany so let me write this World War II..."
Social Studies,"starts everyone is declaring war on each other, Germany invades Poland, Great Britain and France  declare war on Germany, and you have to remember at this point Stalin isn't so concerned about Hitler he's just signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and so in mid-September, Stalin himself invades Poland as well so they both can kind of carve out... ...their spheres of influence..."
Social Studies,"so you can definitely sense that things are  not looking good for the world at this point you already have Asia in the  Second Sino-Japanese War, incredibly bloody war, and now you have kind of, a lot of very similar actors  that you had in World War I and then they're starting to get into  a fairly extensive engagement.."
Social Studies,"And so now we are going to enter into 1940. And were going to see that in 1940 and 1941 things only start to accelerate in the Nazis', and, as we'll soon call them, the Axis Powers' favor. So in April, you have the Germans  invade Denmark and Norway ...Denmark and Norway... ...let me make sure that I spell that right... So Germany invades Denmark and Norway. This is April of 1940. and then you have May of 1940 Germany invades the Netherlands and Belgum. So Netherlands...."
Social Studies," let me just write...let me write... The Low Countries it's sometimes called because this place, the land in the Netherlands, right over here, is very close to sea level or sometimes even below sea level. Low Countries So invades Netherlands, invades Belgium. Kind of, kind of very similar  to what happened in World War I, where that's kind of how Germany gets to France. And then in June, in June, Italy enters the fray. Italy, which we've seen before, Italy declares war."
Social Studies,"Italy in the war, Benito Mousselini in the run-up to World War II is getting closer and closer to Adolf Hitler. And so, in June, Italy declares war on the Allies, on Great Britain and France. And so now Italy, so now Italy is formally in World War II. And as soon as Italy joins World War II, you start having all these skirmishes out here between Italy's colonies, and it's kind of where they're ruling colonially, in Libya, and in Egypt where the  British are essentially in control."
Social Studies,"So you start having all of these skirmishes across the border, the Egyptian and Libyan border. So that was, that was June,  and actually June, Italy is into the war. And then shortly thereafter France falls to Germany. So this wasn't like World War I where we get kind of embroiled in all this trench warfare, that lasts over the duration of most of the war; very quickly, think about it, this is only what... eight, nine months into the war. France falls, a major power, France falls to Germany."
Social Studies,"And they install Vichy France, which at  first is in control for the part of France roughly the part of France that I'm highlighting. This the town of Vichy, which was the capitol of Vichy France. Which is why it's called that. And then later the rest of what's called Free France  falls to Germany, later in the war in 1942. But things are really, really not looking good for the Allies."
Social Studies,"So France falls, falls to Germany, the establishment of Vichy France, which is  essentially controlled by the Germans, and then in July, Germany begins bombing Britain. So bombing... bombing Britain. The famous Battle of Britain, which was actually called  The Battle of Britain even before it began. Winston Churchill said, hey, we have to prepare for the upcoming Battle of Britain. And Germany starts bombing Great Britain. And then thing get only worse from there."
Social Studies,"So in September, in September the Axis forms with Japan, Japan joining. Japan signs the Tripartite Pact, and so becomes... ...the Axis forms between Japan Italy and Germany. ...signs Tripartite Pact.... So Japan is in the mix, and since France is already fallen to Germany."
Social Studies,"So Japan is now formally part of the Axis with Italy and Germany And since France has fallen to Germany, Japan says, hey, maybe we can go after some of France's colonies, and in particular French-Indochina, which we now refer to as Vietnam and Cambodia. And so, shortly thereafter, Japan attacks French Indo-China. so things are not really looking good at all. and it only gets worse from there. In November..."
Social Studies,"so once again we're  a little over a year into the war now, we're entering the end of 1940, in November, Hungary and Romania are pressured to join the Axis So Hungary and Romania join the Axis So as we see as we kind of are leaving 1940, things  are not looking good at all for the Allied powers. You see this map, and I apologize for my messiness, it's looking more and more and more red."
Social Studies,"The only slightly, kind of, saving grace for the Allied Powers is what's happening over here in North Africa, is that eventually the end of 1940, the British are able to drive the Italians back into Libya. So let me do this in a different color,  I'll do blue for the Allies So the British are able to drive  the Italian forces back into Libya."
Social Studies,"And they are essentially able to defeat the Italians in Libya, and, but that's only going to take us into 1941,  which I'll talk about in the next video, where the Germans send reinforcements under the command of Rommel, and they're able to drive the  British back again into Egypt, and we'll see in 1941 Germany  and the Axis Powers only become more and more  and more aggressive. And as we enter the end of 1941 we'll see  the entry of the US into World War II.."
Social Studies,"So let's think about what happens in 1941. So, if we talk about early 1941 or the Spring of 1941, in March, Bulgaria decides to join the Axis powers. You can imagine there's a lot of pressuring applied to them and they kind of see where the momentum is. Let's be on that side."
Social Studies,"Bulgaria joins the Axis and then in North Africa you might remember that in 1940, the Allies, in particular, the British, were able to defeat the Italians and push them back into Libya but now in March of 1941, the Italians get reinforcements, Italian reinforcements and also German reinforcements under the command of Rommel the Desert Fox, famous desert commander and they are able to push the British back to the Egyptian border and they also take siege of the town of Tobruk."
Social Studies,"Now, you might have noticed something that I just drew. The supply lines in the North Africa campaign are very, very, very long and that's part of the reason why there's one side. One side has supply lines and as they start to make progress and as the Allies make progress and push into Libya, their supply lines got really long and so the other side has an easier timely supply."
Social Studies,"Then as the Axis pushes the Allies back into Egypt, then their supply lines get really long and the other side...it makes it easier for them to resupply and so North Africa is kind of defined by this constant back and forth. But, by early 1941, it looks like the Axis is on the offensive, able to push the British back into Egypt lay siege to the town of Tobruk. So, let me write this down as North Africa."
Social Studies,"So, I'll just say North Africa over here or I'll could say Rommel in North Africa pushing the British back. And then we can start talking about what happens in the Balkans and this is still in Spring as we go into April of 1941 and just as a little bit of background here, and frankly I should have covered it a couple of videos ago. As far back as 1939, actually before World War II officially started, in Spring of 1939, Italy actually occupies Albania so this actually should have already been red."
Social Studies,"This is in 1939 that this happens and then at the end of 1940, Italy uses Albania as a base of operation to try to invade Greece but they are pushed back. Actually one of the reasons why the British we able to be pushed back in North Africa is after they were successful against the Italians, most of the bulk of the British forces we sent to Greece to help defend Greece at the end of 1940."
Social Studies,"So, in 1939, Albania gets taken over by Italy and at the end of 1940...October 1940, Greece is invaded by Italy but they are then pushed back but to help the Greeks, the Allies send many of the forces that were in North Africa after they were successful against the Italians in Libya. Now, as we go into April of 1941... that was all background, remember Albania before the war started in April 1939, October 1940 was Italy's kind of first push into Greece and it was unsuccessful."
Social Studies,"Then the Greeks get support from the Allies in North Africa and now as we go into 1941, the Germans start supporting and really take charge in Balkans and in Greece and so with the help of the Germans the Axis is able to take over Yugoslavia and Greece and start aerial bombardment of Crete. So, once again, we're not even halfway through the year in 1941 and we see a huge swath of Europe is under the control of the Axis powers. And now we go into the summer of 1941."
Social Studies,"This is actually a pivotal move, what's about to happen. Now you can imagine that the Axis powers, in particular, Hitler, are feeling pretty confident. We are only about that far into the war. So we're not even two years into the war yet and it looks like the Axis is going to win. Now you might remember that they have a pact with the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"Hey, we're gonna split a lot of Eastern Europe into our spheres of influence so to speak, but now Hitler's like, well, I think I'm ready to attack and when you attack the Soviet Union really matters. You do not want to attack the Soviet Union in the winter...or Russia in the winter. Russia's obviously at the heart of the Soviet Union. That something that Napoleon learned. Many military commanders have learnt."
Social Studies,"You do not want to be fighting in Russia over the winter, so summer of 1941, Hitler figures, hey, this is the Axis chance. And so, in June, he decides to attack the Soviet Union. So, this is a very, very, very bold move because now they're fighting the British. Remember, the British are kind of not a joke to be battling out here in Western Europe and now they're going to be taking on the Soviet Union in the east, a major, major world power."
Social Studies,"But at first, like always, it seems like it's going well for the Germans. By September, they're able to push up all the way to Leningrad. So, this is September of 1941 and lay lay siege and begin laying siege to that town. This is kind of a long bloody siege that happens there. So, we're right now, right about there. And most historians would tell you that this was one of the mistakes of Adolph Hitler because now he is stretched very, very, very thin."
Social Studies,"He has to fight two world powers, Soviet Union and Great Britain and the United States hasn't entered into the war yet and that's what we're about to get into because if we go into Asia it was still in 1941 what happens in July. So, little bit after Hitler decides to start invading the Soviet Union going back on the pact, the non- aggression pact."
Social Studies,"In July, you could imagine the US, they were never pleased with what's been happening, what the Empire of Japan has been doing in the Pacific, what they've been doing in China, in Manchuria or even in terms of the war in China, the second Sino Japanese War. They weren't happy of the Japanese taking over French Indochina. There's a big world power here, the Empire of Japan."
Social Studies,"There's a big world power here, the United States, that has a lot of possessions in the Pacific and so, the United States in July of 1941...So remember, this is still all 1941, this is the same year...decides to freeze the assets of Japan and probably the most important part of that was an oil embargo of Japan. This is a big, big deal. Japan is fighting a major conflict with the Chinese."
Social Studies,"It's kind of flexing it's imperial muscles but it does not have many natural resources in and of itself and in fact, that's one of the reasons why it's trying to colonize other places to get more control of natural resources. And now if it's fighting a war it doesn't have it's own oil resources and now there's an oil embargo of Japan and the United States at the time was major oil producer and even today, it's major oil producer."
Social Studies,"This was a big deal to the Japanese because some estimates say they only had about two years of reserves and they were fighting a war where they might have to touch their reserves even more. So, you could imagine the Japanese, they want to have their imperial ambitions."
Social Studies,"They probably want, especially now with this oil embargo, they probably want to take over more natural resources and they probably want to knock out the US or at least keep the US on its heels so the US can't stop Japan from doing what it wants to do. So, all it wants in December 1941, that's over the course of December 7th and 8th, and it gets a little confusing because a lot of this happens across the International Date Line."
Social Studies,"But over the course of December 7th and 8th, Japan goes on the offensive in a major way in the Pacific. Over the course of several hours, at most, a day, Japan is able to attack Malaya, which is a British possession. It's able to attack Pearl Harbor, where the US Pacific fleet is in hope to knock out the US Pacific fleet so the US will have trouble stopping Japan from doing whatever Japan wants to do."
Social Studies,"In the US, we focus a lot on Pearl Harbor but this was just one of the attacks in this whole kind of several hours of attacks where Japan went on the offensive. So, we have Malaya, we have Pearl Harbor, we have Singapore, we have Guam, we have (which was the US military base), Wake Island. You have the Philippines, which was a US possession ever since the Spanish American war."
Social Studies,"You have Hong Kong, which is a British possession and then shortly after that as you get further into December, so this is kind of when you have Japan offensive. Then as you go on into later Decemeber, the kind of real prize for Japan was what we would now call Indonesia but the Dutch East Indies. On this map it says Netherlands East Indies. You have to remember the Netherlands had been overrun."
Social Studies,"They're the low countries they were already overrun by German forces so the Japanese say hey, look there are a lot of resources here, natural resources, especially oil. Let's go for this and so by the end of 1941, they're also going for the Dutch East Indies and for Burma so you could imagine it's a very aggressive, very, very bold move on Japan but they kind of had imperial ambitions."
Social Studies,"They were afraid of they access to natural resources so they went for it but obviously one of the major consequence of this is the United States was not happy about this and they were already sympathetic to the Allies. They didn't like what was going on in Europe either. They didn't like what was going on in China and so that causes the United States to enter into World War II on the side of the Allies and then the Axis powers to declare war on the United States, which was a big deal.."
Social Studies,"And even before that you´ve had conflicts since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. So Asia has been in conflict for some time. But as we go into 1942, the United States has just entered into World War II. You might remember - December 1941, Japan goes on a major offensive, tries to knock out the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, attacks Wake Island, attacks Guam, attacks Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaya."
Social Studies,"Then shortly thereafter goes after other possessions, Burma, goes after the Dutch-East Indies in its quest for natural resources. And so you can imagine as we go into 1942, the Americans are eager to retaliate. And in these videos - these are overview videos, I cannot talk about every action and battle that happens. I`m just trying  to give you the hightlights - But the first notable action in 1942 is the Doolittle Raid. Named after Colonel Doolittle, who is the architect of this raid."
Social Studies,"The idea is not so much as a strategic victory but more of a psychological one. If the U.S. could somehow attack the mainland of Japan, bomb the mainland of Japan, it would be a huge morale booster for the Americans, and it might cause the Japanese people to question their own leadership."
Social Studies,"And so the idea is  sent a carrier within bomber range roughly 1000 miles of the coast of Japan - and I tried to do research on where they went but I wasn`t able to find - but roughly 1000 miles of the coast of Japan and then send 16 B-25 bombers to bomb the mainland. And they are actually able to do this. 15 of the bombers, since they can`t land back onto the carrier, they are to heavy and to large to do that, they land in China and one of them gets diverted to Russia or the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"And out of the 80 crewman all of planes get lost but out of the 80 crewman three are killed in action, eight are captured, and three are killed in captivity  by the Japanese. But for the most part a hugely successful operation. Only months after Pearl Harbor, the U.S. is able to attack the Japanese mainland. Once again, more of a psychological victory then a strategic one, but a major psychological accomplishment from the ally point of view."
Social Studies,"This was in April, then you can fast forward to May, where you have  the first major naval engagement between the Japanese and the American navy. And that happens  at the Battle of Coral Sea, or the Battle of the Coral Sea, which occurs  roughly over there. And this is significant because the U.S. loses more than the Japanese do, but it is able to cripple the Japanese navy enough that as they go  into the next major offensive, they don´t have quite the firepower that they need."
Social Studies,And that next major offensive happens in June at Midway. In June you have the Battle of Midway. At the Battle of Midway this is a Japanese offensive. Their goal is to further knock out the United States. But it ends up going the other way. And this is considered a big deal. This is the first Japanese naval loss since the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits in 1863. You have a U.S. victory here. Many historians consider this one of the most significant naval battles. We have a U.S. victory here.
Social Studies,"Once again, it´s only seven months since Pearl Harbor. You have Coral Sea which cripples the Japanese navy. - maybe cripple is a strong word but tears them down a little bit - Then you have Midway which is a major U.S. victory. And then that takes us to August where you have the Battle of Guadalcanal. There are several islands over here, the U.S. want to take it, the Japanese want to retake it. But between the on-the-ground forces and the naval forces, the U.S."
Social Studies,"is able to defeat the Japanese and keep them from taking Guadalcanal. This is a big deal because between Midway and Guadalcanal in 1942, this is the turning point. And after this point, Midway,  the Japanese were on the offensive here, the Japanese tried to get the U.S. out of Guadalcanal in August. But in both of those the U.S. are able to defeat the Japanese at Midway, they are able to fend them off at Guadalcanal. This is the turning point where the U.S. is able to go on the offensive."
Social Studies,"1942 is a very big deal. It´s only months after Pearl Harbor, months after the U.S. enters the war but it´s able to start turning the tide, and start to go on the offensive against the Japanese in the Pacific. And what we´ll see in the next video is 1942 also marks the turning of the tide in Europe.."
Social Studies,"or its not the turning point '42 really is the turning point but in 1943, the momentum's really in the allies favor the Soviets defeat the Germans at Stalingrad they are able to push the Germans and the axis powers out of the caucases and then they'd begin to advance and then the Soviets begin to advance and retake ground from the axis powers now at the same time you might remember that at the end of 1942 in North Africa in North Africa, let me go right over here I have all these maps layered over here you might remember that the British were able to push back the axis army back into Lybia and then this just continues as we go into 1943 and the allied armies essentially able to kick the axis army out of North Africa be victorious of North Africa you remember you have these the armies that are coming from Egypt you also had allies land in Morocco and Algeria and then they all meet up and by mid-year they're able to use their victory in North Africa as a launching point to start attacking the main land of Italy they first, they can go to Sicily or then they go to the actual main land, and there's an attack at Selerno and they start to really kind of fight their way up the Italian peninsula we're gonna do this in a blue color so you can see this is the allies, as were going to mid- and late- 1943 are able to take more and more of the Italian peninula now as this happens, conditions i Italy aren't good the Italian people aren't happy and they're actually able to depose Mussolini so let me write that down so this is, In 1943 Mussolini, oh i think there's another s, Mussolini is deposed Mussolini is, Mussolini is deposed and as we get later that year, Italy formally surrenders to the allies now with that said, Italy has surrendered but the entire country of Italy the entire peninsula, there's still axis troops there so the allies have to continue  to slog through 1943 and 1944 and even to 1945 to completely rid Italy of the axis powers, and especially the Germans now Rome especially is fairly hard bombing campaigns start in Rome in order to completely get the axis powers out of there and that all is completely happening in 19- this is all happening in 1943 now other, other things of note and there's many things that are happening in Europe and once again these are just over view videos that are happening in 1943 is American forces early in 1943 are able to start doing bombing attacks on Germany itself and these bombing attacks only become more and more fierce as the war progresses another battle of note, In mid-1943 is the battle of kursk and this is really the last offensive that the axis powers are able to mount on the Eastern Front and they are defeated in this battle by the soviets and then once again that allows the Soviets to start going on the offensive so when you look at things from a European point of view the allies are definitely, they have the bulk over the momentum now they're now kind of putting the squeeze on the axis powers and frankly the same thing is happening in the Pacific especially the Americans, they are now on the offensive they're able to get closer and closer and closer to Japan."
Social Studies,"Incredibly bloody siege, incredibly hard on the civilians of Leningrad. But the Soviet army is finally able to end that, and so you see from these troop movements on this map starting in January of 1944 with the end of the siege, they are able to really take the offensive and start marching through the Baltics, through the Baltic states. At the same time, you have the Soviet armies marching and they're able to force the Axis to surrender in the Crimea."
Social Studies,"You fast forward further into the year, further into 1944. You might remember in 1943, the Allies were able to land on Italy and force the surrender of Italy to the Allied powers. But that doesn't mean that Italy, as we know it today, or even as we knew it then, was free of the German troops, or from the Axis troops. And so, the Allies were continuing to slog through, slog through Italy, and in particular Rome. Rome did not get liberated in 1943. The Allies had to continue bombing Rome."
Social Studies,"And it doesn't get liberated until June of 1944. So Rome is liberated. So liberated in the summer of 1944. That happens June, 5th. The next day, and this is probably one of the most famous events in World War II, especially from an American point of view, something that's documented in many films, is June, 6th, D-Day, 1944. You have the invasion of Normandy, the amphibious invasion of Normandy, probably most famously depicted in the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan."
Social Studies,"We have British, primarily British and American troops. They are able to storm the beaches of Normandy successfully which allows them to start making progress in northern France towards Germany. Now, also in the summer of 1944, rockets start to get involved in a serious way in World War II. The Germans are starting to send their V1 rockets over to Great Britain. And the V1 rockets, this is just significant from the history of technology."
Social Studies,"Obviously today rockets play a big deal in a whole bunch of context, and this was the first time that they were deployed in a major way during a war. The first V1 rockets, they weren't all that impressive, they traveled three or four hundred miles per hour, slower than modern jet-liners. They didn't travel at that high of an altitude."
Social Studies,"But as we'll see, or as we'll see even in this video, within a few months, by September, they were sending in V2 rockets, which were far more advanced, going several thousand miles per hour, getting to altitudes of tens of miles high, and carrying even larger payloads. So the Germans were really starting to push the envelope in terms of rocket science. What's good about the Allie is, is that the Germans were kind, they developed this technology a little bit late."
Social Studies,"They are starting to be on the heels, obviously, on both the Western front and the Eastern front, and even in the South the Allies were really on the offensive now, but rockets are starting to get involved. V1's in the summer, and then the V2's in the fall. Now, also as we go into the late summer and fall, you see that Russians, after defeating the Germans at Kursk, are marching towards, are marching towards Poland, and marching in particular towards Warsaw, as we go through 1944."
Social Studies,"And at the end of 1944, not the end really, at the end of the summer of 1944, in August of 1944, you have the Polish uprising, you have kind of the rebels. The underground is taking on the German occupiers. So this is August, 1944. August, 1944. With the Russian troops, or the Soviet troops not that far away, they're getting closer and closer and closer to Warsaw. Now, also in August of 1944, you have Paris, is liberated. So this is August, 25th, 1944. Paris is liberated."
Social Studies,"And then, as we go later into that year, British troops are able to liberate Athens. So British troops are able to liberate Athens. So Athens is liberated. And actually this, once this liberated, then you start having the beginnings of the Civil War, of the Greek Civil War that occurs between kind of the government troops and the Communists, or as you say the more left-leaning people who were involved in fighting against the Axis powers."
Social Studies,"So, even though they were liberated, it's kind of the start of another unfortunate chapter with the Greek Civil War. And then, finishing out 1944, the Axis powers, and particularly the Germans, they weren't done yet. Even though the war is not looking good, they finally mount a, I guess you could say one of their last counteroffensive, just not their last major counteroffensive. And that's over here against the Allied troops, particularly the American troops, at the Battle of the Bulge."
Social Studies,"And this starts in December of 1944. It's called the Battle of the Bulge because the shape in which, so if the Allied, you know, the front, the Allied front looks like that as it is advancing. The Germans mount a counteroffensive and they are able to create a, what's called in military terms a salient, where they're able to push through, where they're able to push through and kind of create, and create this bulge."
Social Studies,"This is an incredibly bloody battle, it's actually the most bloody battle faced by American troops. They lose nearly 20 thousand, not just lose, 20 thousand die, American troops die just in the Battle of the Bulge that starts in December of 1944. But this really is the Germans last hurrah. You can see they're riding on the wall, troops approaching from the West, troops approaching from the East, troops approaching from the South.."
Social Studies,"on the Allied side, lose roughly 20,000 troops, but by January, they're able to break through and invade Germany. So as you go into early 1945, the Allies are on their march through Western Germany. Now if you go on the east, the Russians or the Soviets are also marching westward. By January of 1945, they're able to take Warsaw, and from there, they continue to march westward towards Berlin. Now the writing is on the wall at this point."
Social Studies,"The Allies look like they are going to win, and so they meet at Yalta, the major powers, to discuss what happens to Europe after World War II. What happens to Germany? Is it split up? What influence will the different Allied victors have in the different countries of World War II? So this is happening in Yalta in February of 1945. Let me write that down. That's in February."
Social Studies,"All the while this is happening, even though the writing is on the wall that the Allies are going to win the war, they weren't taking anything for granted. They wanted to absolutely force a surrender by the Axis powers in Germany in particular. So they continue to firebomb major cities of Germany, and firebombing is an incredibly devastating form of bombing, where you're literally trying to destroy the city, set the city on fire."
Social Studies,"The most notable of these cities that were firebombed were Hamburg and Dresden. The firebombing of Dresden, movies and books are written about it. The Nazis did also firebomb London, but that didn't have quite the same devastating effect as the Allied firebombing of Hamburg and Dresden, and actually of Tokyo and other Japanese cities, as we will see in a few minutes. But then everything really comes to a head in April of 1945."
Social Studies,"It's in April that as you can see, as you get into April and May, the Allies are able to essentially occupy major chunks of Germany. They're able to push Axis forces outside of Italy. They have effectively won. Mussolini gets captured and then gets executed. Soviets are able to take Berlin, and maybe most importantly, April 30th, Hitler commits suicide. So, Hitler commits suicide, and he's not the only one. Several other major leaders, Nazi leaders, commit suicide as we go into this period right over here."
Social Studies,"Essentially the war is won in Europe at this point, and that's made official on May 8th, May 8th, which is a good day to remember, known as VE Day, Victory in Europe, Victory in Europe Day. So the Allies have won in Europe, but everything is not over yet. World War II is still going on in the Pacific. So let's go down to the Pacific Theater. Starting the year in January, the Allies are able to take the Island of Luzon. In particular, they're able to take Manila."
Social Studies,"Then, as we go into February, they began the invasion of Iwo Jima, which is an incredibly bloody campaign. You have 70,000 marines invade the island verus 22,000 Japanese troops. On top of that you obviously have air, you have the Air Force involved, you have the Navy involved, but I guess what's even more mind-boggling, you have significant Allied deaths. You have 7,000 deaths on the Allied side, but even more amazing, out of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers that were defending Iwo Jima, 19,000 get killed."
Social Studies,"So 19,000 of 22,000 Japanese soldiers get killed. So you can imagine how bloody this is. And this picture, which is probably one of the most famous military photos ever taken, especially in the United States, this was taken of Marines storming a hill, storming a mountain in Iwo Jima. And just to imagine how bloody these things are. I just gave you some of the numbers."
Social Studies,"Even this photo, which is a real photograph, even this photo, where it looks like hey look, the Americans have at least taken this mountain or this hill right over here, even out of this photo, three of these Marines die in the next few days as they continue to try to take Iwo Jima or take the entire island. So you can imagine the Japanese were able to mount a ferocious defense of the island. They aren't able to fully take the island until we get into March."
Social Studies,"So by March, so maybe I'll say February to March you have the invasion of Iwo Jima. Now the whole time that this is happening, you have B-29s firebombing major cities in Japan, and especially Tokyo. So once again, these cities are really being destroyed. This is all-out war. But still the Japanese have not surrendered. So in April, actually April going into June, you have to remember April in Europe, this is when it was pretty much done with. Hitler commits suicide in April."
Social Studies,"But in April going into June of 1945, you have the Allied invasion of Okinawa, which once again, is an incredibly bloody campaign. You have above and beyond the tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers that get killed at Okinawa, you have tens and tens of thousands of civilians who get killed or commit suicide. So once again, this is all very unpleasant and very bloody. But we continue on, and still the Japanese have not surrendered."
Social Studies,"Although even in 1944, their navy is all but destroyed, but they're mounting this ferocious defense. In parallel to all of this, the Allies, especially the U.S., has had the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons, and they decide to use them, Truman is now president, in order to accelerate the end of the war. And so in August 6th, they drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, essentially destroying that city."
Social Studies,"And it's interesting to read accounts of how the Japanese learned about it or what they didn't learn about it, obviously. Obviously no one was expecting bombs that could just obliterate a city, literally, in seconds. Still, there wasn't a surrender from the Japanese, and so, let me write this. This is August 6th, and so on August 9th, you have another atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. At the same time that this is happening, you have the Soviet Union invading Manchuria."
Social Studies,"You have the Soviet Union invading Manchuria, and so enough was enough. You have the Soviets who are now getting involved in the Pacific, the Americans seem to be able to literally destroy Japanese cities at will, and so on August 14, 1945, you have the Japanese surrender. Japanese surrender, and then this does not become truly official until September 2, 1945, which is called VJ Day, Victory in Japan Day. That marks the real end of World War II."
Social Studies,"Obviously, World War II ended at the end of April, May, officially early May in Europe, but now in early September it is officially ended in the Pacific as well. And the Allies are victorious.."
Social Studies,"Compare that to the United states in 1945, which had a bustling shared national culture, a social safety net, and lots of industry regulations brought on by depression and war. And the United States was the strongest nation on earth. For a time, the world's lone atomic power. These are all enormous changes, changes in ideas about the economy, American culture, and the United States' role in the world."
Social Studies,"As a historian, I'm curious about how these changes affected American national identity during this period. National identity is a bit of a slippery thing, but it encompasses a lot of core values and beliefs in society about who counts as an American, how Americans should act, and how the United States should relate to other countries. So how can we measure just how much impact the events of the first half of the 20th century had on American national identity."
Social Studies,"First, we need to get more specific about which core beliefs around national identity we wanna track, since one of the changes we're looking at relates to the growing regulation of the American economy in this time period. One belief I think would be valuable to examine over time is individualism. This is the idea that everyone should be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps to earn a good living through their own hard work."
Social Studies,"This has been a pretty core American value over time, but there certainly have been moments when many have question whether it can really be achieved. Next, I'm curious about changes in American cultural identity over this period. People did a lot of moving around in the early 20th century, going from farms to cities, and from the old country to the new."
Social Studies,"So did the United States develop a shared national culture in this time period along with the advent of new communication technologies like the radio, or were cultural values in the United States fractured along lines of race, class, and ethnicity? Finally, since this is the era in which the United States grew into a world power, I'd like to look at changes in beliefs about what the proper US role in the world should be."
Social Studies,"Okay, now that we've decided which core values of national identity we wanna track, let's brain storm some of the major events that may have affected these values during this period. I encourage you to pause the video here, and think about what events you might wanna discuss related to these themes. Think about the big things that happened in this era and how they could affect ideas about individualism, culture, and the United States' role in the world."
Social Studies,"You may come up with some different things than I do, and that's okay. Remember, we're doing a high-level overview of events here, so I'm not gonna go into much depth about any of them. But if I mention something you're not familiar with, just jot it down, and you can follow up on that concept later. Okay, first, let's look at beliefs around individualism. This is really a question about whether people thought it was possible for them to earn a good living through hard work alone."
Social Studies,"In the 1890s, there were a few questions about whether industrialization and business consolidation was making it impossible for ordinary people to succeed, like the farmers who supported the Populist Party, and wanted the government to regulate railroads and alter the money supply. But they didn't get too much traction. The progressive era also introduced some regulations on business, with presidents like Teddy Roosevelt busting trusts, and reformers helping to pass laws protecting workers and consumers."
Social Studies,"The Roaring Twenties, by contrast, was an era of boundless optimism about the individual's ability to get wealthy. With lots of ordinary folks investing in the stock market, and believing that the economic boom would never end, but of course it did end, and with it, so did a lot of people's faith in individualism. Factors outside the control of any one person brought on the great depression, and people looked to the government to provide relief to citizens in a way that it had never done before."
Social Studies,"The new deal established a social safety net and a limited welfare state that would influence the American economy for decades. So looking at this period as a whole, it seems like the events of the first half of the 20th century had a pretty profound effect on the belief in American individualism. Industrialization and then the Great Depression led to a growing sense that the modern industrial economy was too large of a machine for individuals to navigate it successfully on their own."
Social Studies,"And therefore, the government had a duty to see to the welfare of its citizens. Next, let's examine American culture over this time period. Was there one shared national culture, like the melting pot analogy or were there many tensions and divisions in culture over things like ideas, race, religion, or gender roles. During this time period, migration to cities led to the development of cultural enclaves, like Little Italy, and new cultural movements like the Harlem Renaissance."
Social Studies,"Those might suggest a more divided culture. On the other hand, the growing popularity of radio and cinema in the 1920s contributed to the development of a national culture where people across the country could watch the same movies, listen to the same radio shows, and root for the same sports starts."
Social Studies,"But there was also a backlash against immigrant culture and the urban modern environment with the re-emergence of the KKK, restrictions on freedom of speech, and calls for 100% Americanism during World War I, and emigration restrictions in the 1920s. However, American propaganda during World War II emphasize the diversity and inclusiveness of the United States, in contrast to Nazi racial ideology. And US culture became more accepting toward immigrants from European backgrounds."
Social Studies,"But Asian-Americans and African-Americans were so largely excluded. So the cultural transition of the United States is a bit of a mixed bag in this time period. There were both elements that brought the country together in a shared national culture, and elements that divided it based on race, ethnicity, and belief. Last, let's look at beliefs about the role of the United States in the world."
Social Studies,"Up until the Spanish-American war in 1898, the guiding US foreign policy was isolationism, staying out of world affairs. But by the turn of the 20th century, the US government was tempted to get in on the imperial game, like the great powers of Europe, and it did so with the acquisition of Cuba, Hawaii, and the Philippines. United States was also reluctant to get involved in World War I, and did so only very late in the war, after provocation."
Social Studies,"After World War I, the United States return to its policy of isolationism throughout the 1920s and 1930s, but the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 led the country to fully mobilize for war. After the war with Europe in ruins and growing tensions with the Soviet Union, the United States would abandon isolationism as a foreign policy, in favor of membership in the United Nations and military interventions to contain communism."
Social Studies,"So this too is a major shift from outright isolationism, to imperialism, to interventionism. The events of the first half of the 20th century, changed the core belief that the United States was better off staying out of world affairs into the belief that US involvement was crucial to maintaining order in world affairs."
Social Studies,"So given the evidence we've compiled here, which major events of the first half of the 20th century had the greatest impact on national identity? It seems like the aspects of national identity that changed the most were the belief in individualism, which transitioned into a greater acceptance of the role of government in advancing citizen's welfare, and the belief in isolationism, which transitioned into the belief that the United States should intervene in world affairs."
Social Studies,"Which events were most crucial in changing those beliefs? I would say that the Great Depression was the most influential in altering individualism, and World War II was the most influential in altering isolationism. What do you think? Would you come to the same conclusions that I have? Next, think about how you might write a thesis statement in order to answer this question using the evidence that we've gathered.."
Social Studies,"-  I'm doing well. I'm excited to learn about this thing we call ""the Cold War."" What is a ""cold war"" and what makes it different than a ""hot war""? -  So, a cold war, and in this case it's really, it might be a term that we could debate. is a war where the two major combatants never actually fire bullets at each other or drop bombs on each other. So never in the course of the Cold War did the US ever meet the ground troops with the USSR. -  But people still died in combat."
Social Studies,"-  Right. -  So the Cold War is kind of fought through proxy wars. And these are wars that are taking place in other nations, developing nations of the world where the US is supporting one side, generally the pro-capitalist side, and the Soviet Union is supporting the other side, a communist side. So this is the case in the Korean War in the 1950s, and then definitely the case in the Vietnam War in the 1960s."
Social Studies,"-  So the US and the USSR aren't fighting directly but they're kind of betting on boxing matches, betting on different fighters in the same boxing match. -  Yeah, but they're not just betting, they're also putting money and arms where their mouth is. -  So now if there are two different fighters in the ring, the US is given the capitalist fighter... feeding him..."
Social Studies,"-  So you've got the capitalist fighter in one corner and he's sweaty and he's beaten, but the US is behind him with a towel and one of those water buckets, splashing water in his face, like ""Get in this fight! Get in there!' -  Right. And if necessary, tying up his boxing gloves, maybe giving him a new pair of shoes. -  Sure. -  Doing whatever they can... -  Paying his rent... -  Right. Doing everything that they can..."
Social Studies,"-  Buying him meals, probably, like at the Marshall Plan. -  Exactly! -  Okay, so tell me about these two combatants. In this corner... -  Laughs. -  Wearing a suit... -  (laughs) Is Harry Truman. And Harry Truman is the President of the United States, starting in 1945. He was Vice President to Franklin Roosevelt, who had been the US's president since 1932, and who tragically died in 1945."
Social Studies,"So Truman is really in charge of ending World War II for the United States and also kind of setting up post-war plans. -  So he prosecutes the end of the war. He makes the decision to drop the atom bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and he ends the war in both theaters. -  Right. -  Okay. -  And... -  And in the other corner, wearing a very fine mustache... -  (laughs) Is Joseph Stalin. And he's the Soviet premier."
Social Studies,"He's been in charge since the 1920s. And for him, I would say the most important thing that Stalin wanted after World War II was security, shall we say. -  Okay. -  So if you remember your history, in World War I Germany invaded Russia. In World War II Germany invaded Russia. -  Oh, I'm seeing a pattern. -  And if there's anything that Stalin wants in the post-1945 era, it is not to be invaded by Germany anymore. -  Sure."
Social Studies,"-  So he is very anxious to make sure that the world is safe for communism. He thinks that the best way to make sure that Russians can continue the experiments and the revolution of communism is to have a buffer zone, shall we say, between Russia and the rest of Europe. -  Okay."
Social Studies,"-  And if he does that by kind of shoring up some puppet governments, in what we now call the Eastern Block, these nations that had been taken over by Hitler and then when the Soviet Union joined the war on the side of the Allies, then were retaken over by Russia as they fought Hitler back. -  Okay. So a lot of those central European countries like Hungary, and Lithuania, and the former Czechoslovakia, and the former Yugoslavia."
Social Studies,"-  And he had the advantage of having boots on the ground there because he'd beaten back Hitler's invasion, eventually White Russian troops were fighting against Hitler, and American troops who were fighting against Hitler. You know, they meet in Berlin at the fall of Hitler, and kind of shake hands in Berlin. But the advantage that Russia had was that they've got a lot more people here. They've got most of Europe now, at least east of Berlin, has Soviet troops on the ground. -  Sure."
Social Studies,"So you've been telling me that the Soviet Union did yeoman's work in containing and basically prosecuting the entire Eastern Front during World War II. -  Yeah, and the Soviet Union actually lost 20 million people during World War II. That's just a ludicrous number. They lost more than anyone except for China and Germany. So they feel like they have a real stake in the outcome of World War II."
Social Studies,"-  So, at the end of this, what is the situation in the USSR? Like they've conquered all of this territory but are they strong enough economically to hold all of it and feed everyone? -  No, not really. In fact, most of Europe is in pretty dire straits if you think about it. All of World War II was really kind of fought, right, in Europe... -  Right in the European bread basket. -  And so there is serious economic trouble in the aftermath of World War II."
Social Studies,"People don't have enough to eat. They certainly don't have any cash, and they don't have any fuel, which is very worrisome in 1946 because of the terrible winter. So people are cold and they are hungry. And when people are cold and hungry there is a lot of fuel for a possible revolution, right?. Even in the 1930s, in the United States, there's a lot of different political ideas that come up during the Great Depression."
Social Studies,"Because when your political system isn't working well, you consider other kinds of political systems. -  So the United States is worried that, because of the cold winter of 1946, and scarcity across western Europe, this blue part of the map will turn much redder. -  Right. So for the United States, they're worried that communism is kind of the child of hunger and poverty."
Social Studies,"And they're afraid that because Stalin has so much territory in Europe, that he is really well poised to become ""Hitler, part two."" -  Okay. And that is a sequel the United States does not want to see. -  No. Absolutely not."
Social Studies,"And if they really learned anything from World War II, it's that appeasement doesn't work, right? During the 1930s, many people in the West, the prime minister of England, Neville Chamberlain, kind of felt like they didn't want to go back to war because World War I is still very much on people's minds during the 1930s. And so they figured, let's not confront Hitler head on because we're not up for that right now. We're also in the middle of worldwide depression."
Social Studies,"And that helped nothing because it just meant that Hitler could gain a whole lot of territory and World War II was much worse than it might have been if they hadn't gone after Hitler earlier. -  And stopped the Anschluss. -  Yes. -  If you stop the Anschluss, you stop the ""onschlaught."" -  (laughs) Exactly."
Social Studies,"So they're really trying to say, all right, Stalin, if he wants to, could probably just run his way through the rest of Europe, right, with very little resistance, because the only nation in the world that has the military and economic power to stop the Soviet Union is the United States. -  Because their factories and fields were not bombed to cinders during the European theater. -  Right."
Social Studies,"So if they wanna stop ""Hitler, part two, the Stalin years,"" then they're going to have to really stand up for capitalism and also for the kind of material comforts and democratic, what we call, self-determination. This is one of the most important ideas to come out of the alliance between the United States and Britain, which is that the citizens of a region should have the right to decide their own form of government. -  And they think of the Soviets as being totalitarians."
Social Studies,"And that's not a wrong assessment because there is a very strong totalitarian control coming out of Moscow and the Soviet Union. So they say, If we're going to keep Europe from turning all red, all communist, then we're going to need to kind of shore up Europe. They think of communism as kind of being a little bit like a flood, shall we say, that you gotta, you gotta put sandbags around the edges of communism. Otherwise, it's gonna leak out."
Social Studies,"-  So is the United States and their allies also interested in creating their own kind of light blue buffer zone, also next to the Eastern Block? Or are they interested in... Is this when we get into the creation of NATO? -  NATO really comes out of an understanding that World War II has not created peace and so the US is going to have to forego their more than a century-long commitment to being isolationist and take a stronger role in the world."
Social Studies,"-  So, okay, for the folks at home, what does NATO stand for? North Atlantic Treaty Organization? -  North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And this is a defensive alliance between, at first, 12 nations, which say that an attack on one will be treated as an attack on all. -  Gotcha! Well, that sounds like they're maneuvering their boxers into position and rubbing the shoulders and getting them ready. -  Yes. Very much so."
Social Studies,"And I think one of the tragedies of the post-war era is that maybe things didn't have to be like this? Right after the US and the USSR had worked together to defeat Hitler, it might have possible for them to coexist peacefully? But I think they both had the idea that the other economic system, and we're talking about communism and capitalism, were just kind of riddled with internal inconsistencies and that eventually the world would be all capitalist or all communist."
Social Studies,And they were going to have to really marshal all of their resources behind their chosen boxer or they were gonna lose. -  Sounds like a fight that's gonna take a long time. -  And it did. -  End round one!.
Social Studies,"And this is really just going to be an overview. People can do a whole PhD thesis on this type of thing. Capitalism, and then I'll get a little bit more-- and then we could progress to socialism. And then we can go to communism. And the modern versions of communism are really kind of the brainchild of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. Karl Marx was a German philosopher in the 1800s, who, in his Communist Manifesto and other writings, kind of created the philosophical underpinnings for communism."
Social Studies,"And Vladimir Lenin, who led the Bolshevik Revolution in the-- and created, essentially, the Soviet Union-- he's the first person to make some of Karl Marx's ideas more concrete. And really every nation or every country which we view as communist has really followed the pattern of Vladimir Lenin. And we'll talk about that in a second. But first, let's talk about the philosophical differences between these things, and how you would move."
Social Studies,"And Karl Marx himself viewed communism as kind of a progression from capitalism through socialism to communism. So what he saw in capitalism-- and at least this part of what he saw was right-- is that you have private property, private ownership of land. That's the main aspect of capitalism. And this is the world that most of us live in today."
Social Studies,"The problem that he saw with capitalism is he thought, well, look, when you have private property, the people who start accumulating some capital-- and when we talk about capital, we could be talking about land, we could be talking about factories, we could be talking about any type of natural resources-- so the people who start getting a little bit of them-- so let me draw a little diagram here. So let's say someone has a little bit of capital. And that capital could be a factory, or it could be land."
Social Studies,"So let me write it. Capital. And let's just say it's land. So let's say someone starts to own a little bit of land. And he owns more than everyone else. So then you just have a bunch of other people who don't own land. But they need, essentially-- and since this guy owns all the land, they've got to work on this guy's land. They have to work on this guy's land. And from Karl Marx's point of view, he said, look, you have all of these laborers who don't have as much capital. This guy has this capital."
Social Studies,"And so he can make these laborers work for a very small wage. And so any excess profits that come out from this arrangement, the owner of the capital will be able to get it. Because these laborers won't be able to get their wages to go up. Because there's so much competition for them to work on this guy's farm or to work on this guy's land. He really didn't think too much about, well, maybe the competition could go the other way."
Social Studies,"Maybe you could have a reality eventually where you have a bunch of people with reasonable amounts of capital, and you have a bunch of laborers. And the bunch of people would compete for the laborers, and maybe the laborers could make their wages go up, and they could eventually accumulate their own capital. They could eventually start their own small businesses. So he really didn't think about this reality too much over here. He just saw this reality."
Social Studies,"And to his defense-- and I don't want to get in the habit of defending Karl Marx too much-- to his defense, this is what was happening in the late 1800s, especially-- we have the Industrial Revolution. Even in the United States, you did have kind of-- Mark Twain called it the Gilded Age. You have these industrialists who did accumulate huge amounts of capital. They really did have a lot of the leverage relative to the laborers."
Social Studies,"And so what Karl Marx says, well, look, if the guy with all the capital has all the leverage, and this whole arrangement makes some profits, he's going to be able to keep the profits. Because he can keep all of these dudes' wages low. And so what's going to happen is that the guy with the capital is just going to end up with more capital. And he's going to have even more leverage. And he'll be able to keep these people on kind of a basic wage, so that they can never acquire capital for themselves."
Social Studies,"So in Karl Marx's point of view, the natural progression would be for these people to start organizing. So these people maybe start organizing into unions. So they could collectively tell the person who owns the land or the factory, no, we're not going to work, or we're going to go on strike unless you increase our wages, or unless you give us better working conditions. So when you start talking about this unionization stuff, you're starting to move in the direction of socialism."
Social Studies,"The other element of moving in the direction of socialism is that Karl Marx didn't like this kind of high concentration-- or this is socialists in general, I should say-- didn't like this high concentration of wealth."
Social Studies,"That you have this reality of not only do you have these people who could accumulate all of this wealth-- and maybe, to some degree, they were able to accumulate it because they were innovative, or they were good managers of land, or whatever, although the Marxists don't give a lot of credit to the owners of capital. They don't really give a lot of credit to saying maybe they did have some skill in managing some type of an operation. But the other problem is is that it gets handed over."
Social Studies,"It gets handed over to their offspring. So private property, you have this situation where it just goes from maybe father to son, or from parent to a child. And so it's not even based on any type of meritocracy. It's really just based on this inherited wealth. And this is a problem that definitely happened in Europe."
Social Studies,"When you go back to the French Revolution, you have generation after generation of nobility, regardless of how incompetent each generation would be, they just had so much wealth that they were essentially in control of everything. And you had a bunch of people with no wealth having to work for them. And when you have that type of wealth disparity, it does lead to revolutions. So another principle of moving in the socialist direction is kind of a redistribution of wealth. So let me write it over here."
Social Studies,"So redistribution. So in socialism, you can still have private property. But the government takes a bigger role. So you have-- let me write this. Larger government. And one of the roles of the government is to redistribute wealth. And the government also starts having control of the major factors of production."
Social Studies,"So maybe the utilities, maybe some of the large factories that do major things, all of a sudden starts to become in the hands of the government, or in the words of communists, in the hands of the people. And the redistribution is going on, so in theory, you don't have huge amounts of wealth in the hands of a few people. And then you keep-- if you take these ideas to their natural conclusion, you get to the theoretical communist state."
Social Studies,"And the theoretical communist state is a classless, and maybe even a little bit-- a classless society, and in Karl Marx's point of view-- and this is a little harder to imagine-- a stateless society. So in capitalism, you definitely had classes. You had the class that owns the capital, and then you had the labor class, and you have all of these divisions, and they're different from each other."
Social Studies,"He didn't really imagine a world that maybe a laborer could get out of this, they could get their own capital, then maybe they could start their own business. So he just saw this tension would eventually to socialism, and eventually a classless society where you have a central-- Well, he didn't even go too much into the details but you have kind of equal, everyone in society has ownership over everything, and society somehow figures out where things should be allocated, and all of the rest."
Social Studies,And it's all stateless. And that's even harder to think about in a concrete fashion. So that's Karl Marx's view of things. But it never really became concrete until Vladimir Lenin shows up. And so the current version of communism that we-- The current thing that most of us view as communism is sometimes viewed as a Marxist-Leninist state. These are sometimes used interchangeably.
Social Studies,"Marxism is kind of the pure, utopian, we're eventually going to get to a world where everyone is equal, everyone is doing exactly what they want, there's an abundance of everything. I guess to some degree, it's kind of describing what happens in Star Trek, where everyone can go to a replicator and get what they want. And if you want to paint part of the day, you can paint part of the day, and you're not just a painter, you can also do whatever you want. So it's this very utopian thing."
Social Studies,"Let me write that down. So pure Marxism is kind of a utopian society. And just in case you don't know what utopian means, it's kind of a perfect society, where you don't have classes, everyone is equal, everyone is leading these kind of rich, diverse, fulfilling lives. And it's also, utopian is also kind of viewed as unrealistic. It's kind of, if you view it in the more negative light, is like, hey, I don't know how we'll ever be able to get there. Who knows? I don't want to be negative about it."
Social Studies,"Maybe we will one day get to a utopian society. But Leninist is kind of the more practical element of communism. Because obviously, after the Bolshevik Revolution, 1917, in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union gets created, they have to actually run a government. They have to actually run a state based on these ideas of communism. And in a Leninist philosophy-- and this is where it starts to become in tension with the ideas of democracy-- in a Leninist philosophy, you need this kind of a party system."
Social Studies,"So you need this-- and he calls this the Vanguard Party. So the vanguard is kind of the thing that's leading, the one that's leading the march. So this Vanguard Party that kind of creates this constant state of revolution, and its whole job is to guide society, is to kind of almost be the parent of society, and take it from capitalism through socialism to this ideal state of communism. And it's one of those things where the ideal state of communism was never-- it's kind of hard to know when you get there."
Social Studies,"And so what happens in a Leninist state is it's this Vanguard Party, which is usually called the Communist Party, is in a constant state of revolution, kind of saying, hey, we're shepherding the people to some future state without a real clear definition of what that future state is."
Social Studies,"And so when you talk about Marxist-Leninist, besides talking about what's happening in the economic sphere, it's also kind of talking about this party system, this party system where you really just have one dominant party that it will hopefully act in the interest of the people. So one dominant communist party that acts in the interest of the people."
Social Studies,"And obviously, the negative here is that how do you know that they actually are acting in the interest of people? How do you know that they actually are competent? What means are there to do anything if they are misallocating things, if it is corrupt, if you only have a one-party system? And just to make it clear, the largest existing communist state is the People's Republic of China. And although it is controlled by the Communist Party, in economic terms it's really not that communist anymore."
Social Studies,"And so it can be confusing. And so what I want to do is draw a little bit of a spectrum. On the vertical axis, over here, I want to put democratic. And up here, I'll put authoritarian or totalitarian. Let me put-- well, I'll put authoritarian. I'll do another video on the difference. And they're similar. And totalitarian is more an extreme form of authoritarian, where the government controls everything. And you have a few people controlling everything and it's very non-democratic."
Social Studies,"But authoritarian is kind of along those directions. And then on this spectrum, we have the capitalism, socialism, and communism. So the United States, I would put-- I would put the United States someplace over here. I would put the United States over here. It has some small elements of socialism. You do have labor unions. They don't control everything. You also have people working outside of labor unions. It does have some elements of redistribution. There are inheritance taxes."
Social Studies,"There are-- I mean it's not an extreme form of redistribution. You can still inherit private property. You still have safety nets for people, you have Medicare, Medicaid, you have welfare. So there's some elements of socialism. But it also has a very strong capitalist history, private property, deep market, so I'd stick the United States over there. I would put the USSR-- not current Russia, but the Soviet Union when it existed-- I would put the Soviet Union right about there."
Social Studies,"So this was the-- I would put the USSR right over there. I would put the current state of Russia, actually someplace over here. Because they actually have fewer safety nets, and they kind of have a more-- their economy can kind of go crazier, and they actually have a bigger disparity in wealth than a place like the United States. So this is current Russia."
Social Studies,"And probably the most interesting one here is the People's Republic of China, the current People's Republic of China, which is at least on the surface, a communist state. But in some ways, it's more capitalist than the United States, in that they don't have strong wealth redistribution. They don't have kind of strong safety nets for people. So you could put some elements of China-- and over here, closer to the left."
Social Studies,"And they are more-- less democratic than either the US or even current Russia, although some people would call current Russia-- well, I won't go too much into it. But current China, you could throw it here a little bit. So it could be even a little bit more capitalist than the United States. Definitely they don't even have good labor laws, all the rest. But in other ways, you do have state ownership of a lot, and you do have state control of a lot."
Social Studies,"So in some ways, they're kind of spanning this whole range. So this right over here is China. And even though it is called a communist state, in some ways, it's more capitalist than countries that are very proud of their capitalism. But in a lot of other ways, especially with the government ownership and the government control of things, and this one dominant party, so it's kind of Leninist with less of the Marxist going on. So in that way, it is more in the communist direction."
Social Studies,So hopefully that clarifies what can sometimes be a confusing topic..
Social Studies,"So the Japanese are essentially this colonial, this imperialist power here. And they stay in power in the Korean peninsula all the way until the end of World War II. And it's probably worth saying here-- and it's probably worth making and doing a bunch of videos here-- that the Japanese occupation was not a pleasant occupation for the Korean people. They subjugated the Korean people in multiple ways. Forced labor, forced prostitution. They tried to eradicate the Korean language and the Korean culture."
Social Studies,"So this was not in any way a pleasant occupation. They weren't pleasant imperialists. But you fast forward all the way to 1945, we know that Japan loses World War II. And the major two victors on the Allied side, that are kind of acting in this part of the world, are the United States and the Soviet Union. And so in 1945, you have the Soviets coming from above. That's the Soviets, coming from above. And eventually, you have the Americans coming from below. They occupy Japan first. So this is the USA."
Social Studies,"And they essentially, remember at this point, even though this is kind of the beginning of the Cold War, at this point in World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union are allies. And so United States tells us the Soviet Union, hey, why don't we just stop at the 38th parallel? The United States actually didn't even think that the Soviets would stop there, but they actually did."
Social Studies,"And from the Soviet's point of view, it's believed that they stopped there, because the United States didn't get there at the same time. So there was no one to stop them from going further South. But it's believed that the Soviets wanted to uphold their side of the agreement so that they would be a trusted party to negotiations in Europe, and maybe get more in Europe, which is what the Soviets maybe cared about more."
Social Studies,"So what happens after World War II is that the North, what is now North Korea essentially, becomes under the influence of the Soviets. Everything below the 38th parallel becomes under the influence of the United States. The Soviets essentially install this gentleman right over here to lead North Korea-- Kim Il Sung-- or the part of Korea that is north of the 38th parallel. At this point, this was just kind of viewed as a point where the Soviets and the United States should meet up."
Social Studies,"Where they would have to stop. It wasn't meant to be an actual partition of the country. But as we'll see, it actually becomes a partition of the country. But the Soviets install Kim Il Sung. He sets up a communist, essentially a communist dictatorship in the North. And this is the current leader of North Korea's dad. This is Kim Jong Il's dad. So he gets installed in the North. And in the South, if you fast forward a little bit to 1948, there's an attempt at elections."
Social Studies,"But those elections are seriously rigged. And this gentleman, Syngman Rhee, comes to power. And although he might look like a nice, pleasant man, he was actually fairly ruthless. And he is unanimously considered a strong man. And on both sides-- and so once again, this is one of those situations where you really can't call either of these guys good guys because both of them have done some pretty nasty, nasty things to each other, to soldiers on either side, and to innocent civilians."
Social Studies,"But Syngman Rhee comes to power in the south, and his, I guess, most attractive feature to the Americans is that he is not a communist. And so you have this situation setting up communist North above 38th parallel. Non-communist South, controlled by Syngman Rhee, supported by the United States. The other thing that happens is that the Soviets help build up the North Korean military. The United States is not as encouraging of a strong South Korean military."
Social Studies,"So you start having an imbalance between the military of the North and the South. And obviously, either one of these parties, Kim Il Sung wants to unite Korea under his rule, under his communist rule. Syngman Rhee wants to unite Korea under his authoritarian rule. So they're both setting up the troops along the border. And this whole time you have skirmishes going on across the border. And just to give you a context, you're probably saying, wait, Korea is right next to China."
Social Studies,"What was going on there? And if you go to China, in 1949, the Communists come to power. There was a civil war leading up to that between the Communists led by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek. Mao Zedong comes to power. He wants to support the communists in North Korea, especially because some of those communists in North Korea actually helped fight on the communist side during the Chinese Civil War. So this is an important factor right here."
Social Studies,"Mao Zedong is interested in spreading Communism. He doesn't like the Americans in South Korea, and he feels some type of allegiance to the communists in North Korea. So now you fast forward to June 25, 1950. And in the North, you have a major event. The North Korean army-- and it's not called North Korea at this point-- they both consider themselves Korea, competing, I guess, governments of Korea. The army in the North is disproportionately stronger than the South, and so they invade."
Social Studies,"They view this as their chance at unifying the peninsula. And essentially, they're able to almost just storm through the Korean peninsula. Immediately, when that happens, the UN, and especially the United States-- and this is because at this point, the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council, so they couldn't even veto it-- the UN immediately starts supplying naval and air support for the South Koreans. But the disparity is so big that the North Koreans are able to just keep marching forward."
Social Studies,"Within a few days, literally by July 1, the United States decides to commit ground forces, because we had substantial ground forces in Japan, which isn't that far away. Just to give you a global perspective, this is the Korean peninsula right here. And this is Japan. I know I could have probably found a bigger picture of that. But America had military forces in Japan that they could send, and so the Americans enter the battle in a major way, very early on."
Social Studies,"But that doesn't stop the North Koreans for some time. So the North Koreans get all the way, they're able to occupy all of the Korean peninsula, except for the northeastern corner. So they get around this far. Over here, you have the city of Pusan. And this is called the Pusan Perimeter. And it's at the Pusan Perimeter that you have a little bit of a, the United States and Korean forces combined are able to halt the North Koreans. And you have a slight stalemate for a couple of months here."
Social Studies,"But while that stalemate is happening, the United States is able to-- and especially the UN, but it's mainly the United States-- is able to build up significant troops within the Pusan Perimeter. But even more, and at this point, the United States and the UN forces, go under the control of Douglas MacArthur, General Douglas MacArthur, who's a bit of an interesting character. Until this point, he was able to rule Japan with an iron fist."
Social Studies,"He's a hugely popular war hero in America, and the current president, Truman, kind of has a little trouble controlling MacArthur, especially during the Korean War. And we'll see that MacArthur really oversteps his bounds during the course of this war. Now, at this point, you have the South Koreans and the Americans kind of cornered down here inside of the Pusan Perimeter. It looks like North Korea's on the verge of victory. But the US is able to build forces."
Social Studies,"And the Korean War really just starts becoming into a game of Risk. I don't know if you've ever played the game of Risk, but whenever it's somebody's turn, they're able to spread their forces. But then they get spread thin, and then the other side's able to come back. And what we'll see is the rest of the Korean War is essentially a back and forth between the Communists in the North-- supported by the Chinese, although the Chinese aren't in the war officially just yet-- and then the Americans in the South."
Social Studies,"And the first really smart thing that MacArthur does is he says, look, instead of trying to fight our way through the Korean forces that are over here, why don't we just kind of outflank them? And why don't we use our navy to do an amphibious landing of an army at Incheon? So on September 15, while you have the stalemate over here, the United States, they have an amphibious landing. So they send troops from all of these places. They have an amphibious landing at Incheon, which is near Seoul."
Social Studies,"So they land right over, they land at Incheon, which is roughly over there. I'm not super accurate here. And what's interesting about that is, in any battle, all of these Korean troops right here, they have supply chains. They have to get food and supplies and fresh troops from up here. And so the further in you go into enemy territory, the more spread out your troops get."
Social Studies,"And the strategy here is instead of fighting through this, what if we outflank them and are able to land a significant force right here, and immediately disrupt the supply lines of the North Koreans. And that's essentially what the Americans did. And it was successful. So MacArthur looks like a genius over here, and he's able to retake Seoul. He's able to take what's kind of the North Korean capital at this point, Pyongyang, and you have the Americans marching north."
Social Studies,"So all of a sudden, it started off with the North Koreans being able to roll down, and now all of a sudden the Americans and the South Koreans are able to roll up. And they're feeling pretty good about themselves. And the whole time, Truman's trying to keep MacArthur under check. MacArthur is excited. He's ultra confident. He thinks that the troops are going to be home by Christmas."
Social Studies,"He doesn't think China is serious about supporting the North Koreans, and even more, he almost, it seems, like wants to pick a fight with China because he wants to maybe eliminate communism in China as well. He viewed it as he's on this mission to eliminate communism from all of Asia. So Truman is saying limited war. Don't cross the Yalu River, and be careful. Don't start attacking Chinese up here and enrage them, and you're going to have them enter the war. MacArthur doesn't take that too seriously."
Social Studies,"And he also says, look, I have to start bombing bombs across the Yalu River so that the Chinese won't be able to send troops and supplies to aid the North Koreans. So he's marching up, all confident, going up against the Yalu River. And this whole time, the Chinese, under Mao Zedong, are sending a pretty substantial army. And they're able to do it secretly."
Social Studies,"They're able to march at night, and they even have these policies where if any surveillance planes go overhead, all of the Chinese soldiers have to freeze. And if they don't freeze, someone else is allowed to shoot them. So everyone wants to freeze so that no one can really see them from above. So it's this really secret buildup of troops across the Yalu River, and this whole time MacArthur is just ultra, ultra confident about what's happening over here."
Social Studies,"But then you fast forward until the end of October, the Americans think that they're on the verge of winning the Korean War. And all of a sudden, you have the Chinese cross the Yalu River. And the Americans didn't even know that the Chinese had major forces ready to cross. And once again, it's just like a game of Risk. Now you have the Chinese cross. They catch the Americans unsuspected. They engage a few times. The Americans weren't sure if the Chinese were serious."
Social Studies,"So they keep re-engaging them, but it becomes clear, yes the Chinese are serious. And essentially the Chinese are able to push back the Americans and the South Koreans all the way back so that they are able to recapture Seoul. But once again, like any game of Risk, now the Chinese are spread thin. The Americans and the South Koreans, and all the other UN forces-- although the UN forces are mainly the Americans-- are able to regroup."
Social Studies,"And then, in March-- so Seoul has changed hands four times-- so in March, they're able to retake Seoul again. And at this point, MacArthur is ultra confident. He's telling the Chinese, you've essentially lost. He's even trying to get permissions to use nuclear weapons against the Chinese. To some degree, he doesn't even think he needs the permission of Truman to stop. It sounds like he's eager to push the Chinese further back, even though they surprised him the first go around."
Social Studies,"So Truman has enough of this wild card guy, who thinks that he can call the shots and use nuclear weapons if he wants to, willy nilly. And so Truman finally dismisses MacArthur in April of 1951. And at this point, you start having a stalemate near the 38th parallel. So that you start having a stalemate across this border right over there. And both sides think the end of the war is imminent. They're like, OK, we're back to where we both began. We should both stop here."
Social Studies,"But the negotiations, unfortunately, took over two years. And there was a lot of back and forth about what to do with prisoners of war and all of the rest. But it finally took two years so that on July 27, 1953, you have an armistice signed between the two parties. And I want to make it clear, an armistice agreement, it is not a peace treaty. It is not saying that we both agree that this is the border of our two new countries and that we are now at peace with each other."
Social Studies,"All an armistice means is that we're going to stop fighting. It is not a formal end to the war. So in theory, North and South Korea, even to this day, are in a state of war. And to this day, I'm recording this video in 2011. Maybe if you view this in the future, hopefully they won't be in an official state of war. But they're in an official state of war under an armistice. They've just agreed to stop fighting."
Social Studies,"So all in all, you have this hugely bloody battle with all of these atrocities going on on both sides. Syngman Rhee when he was, the first time when the North Korean troops were rolling in to South Korea, he essentially, beforehand, he was imprisoning a bunch of people who he suspected to be communists. We're not talking about people, I'm talking about whole families sometimes."
Social Studies,"And when he was retreating, he essentially allowed the massacre of a huge number of people who were just suspected of being communists. These weren't just military men. These were women. These were children. These were entire families, so he is guilty of that. And Kim Il Sung just as guilty when the North Korean soldiers infiltrated South Korea in Seoul, they committed atrocities killing civil servants, killing any of the established intellectuals in the area. So on both sides. This hugely horrific war."
Social Studies,"And just to get a sense of what was happening. Korea isn't a huge country, but you have within Korea, the civilian deaths, 1.5 to 3 million civilian deaths and the consensus is at 2 million. And this tells you how ugly war is that you can't even estimate how many people died to the nearest 500,000 people. You just don't know what happened. Two million people died in a country that's not too big. All in all, you have about 40,000 American soldiers dying."
Social Studies,"China loses on the order of, depending on the estimates, 400,000 soldiers. I mean the estimates are all over the place. North Korea loses, on the order, same magnitude of soldiers. South Korea loses several hundred thousand soldiers. So you have this hugely bloody battle, this hugely bloody war, I should say, that really ends with an outcome that wasn't so different from where it started.."
Social Studies,"So this is after he's already had, you know, the Bay of Pigs has happened, the Cuban Missle Crisis has happened. He is not a big fan of Fidel Castro. But with that said, in hindsight, JFK did say this. This is pretty objective assessment of what Batista was like as the dictator of Cuba. This is John F."
Social Studies,"Kennedy saying this: ""I believe there is no country in the world including any and all the countries under colonial domination, where economic colonization, humiliation and exploitation were worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my country's policies during the Batista regime. To some extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the United States."
Social Studies,"Now we shall have to pay for those sins."" So even JFK in hindsight is saying that Batista was really not the best person and it really was not a good idea for the United States to support such a corrupt dictator for so long in Cuba. This is Batista right over here, riding with some U.S. generals in a parade when he visited DC. So you can imagine he was not a popular person in control of Cuba and in 1959 you have a successful revolution against him."
Social Studies,"In 1959 there is a revolution and the revolution is led by this character, Fidel Castro, and his kind of two right hand men are Raul Castro and Che Guevara right over here and they take control of Cuba. They're part of this nationalist, revolutionary movement. Now the one thing they do do, and they are left-leaning from the beginning, people assume that they are maybe communists or quasi-communists."
Social Studies,"But even from the get-go as soon as they take power, they start taking over lands that were owned by, well, one that was private Cuban property, some of it that was United States property."
Social Studies,"Their arguement would have probably been that this was wealth, private property that was ill gotten, that was gotten in the time of Batista, but they did in a broad sweep , so they took over a lot of private land, a lot of private property, which also led to people thinking hey, this is not just a nationalist revolution, this is also a communist revolution but you could also imagine that once they take over there this huge migration of Cubans to the United States and there, it's primarily middle class, upper middle class Cubans, educated Cubans, who were really afraid of what Fidel Castro is doing in terms of taking over of private land, taking people's property."
Social Studies,"So you start having this Cuban exile community really focused around Florida and mainly Miami and they're still there. And they're very unhappy with this Fidel Castro character right over here. So when we fast forward into 1961 John F. Kennedy becomes president, He gets elected in 1960, becomes president in early 1961. We're now fast forwarding to April, 1961 so JFK has only been president for a few months."
Social Studies,"But you can imagine a lot of levels you have all of these Cuban exiles, upper middled class, educated, middle class, Cuban exiles who hate Fidel Castro. He's taking over their land he's turning it into what looks like a leftist state. This is all happening within the context of the cold war, the US is afraid of countries falling to communism."
Social Studies,"It looks like Fidel Castro is a communist, so the US decides the fact that you have all of the exisles who wanna oust him to the US porbably wants to oust him just because he's a communist and they're afraid that he's going to align himself with the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"So in conjunction with the Cuban exiles and the CIA, and this right here is the director of the Central Intelligence during the Kennedy administration or at least the beginning part of the Kennedy administration, this is Allen Dulles, his brother is John Foster Dulles, where Dulles Airport is named after and he was a US Secretary of State."
Social Studies,"They decide that they want to oust Fidel Castro, but they want to do it in a way that the US does not look like it's the one doing the invasion, so what they do is they plan an invasion where they take Cuban exiles and they get 1400 men to sign up to be kind of part of this CIA backed , US backed force to invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro."
Social Studies,"And a lot of this was based on the premise, and you can imagine this even happened in the iraq war, where the CIA, the American President, they kind of surround themselves with people who tell them, who one give them a very optimistic, hopeful scenario telling them ""Look."
Social Studies,"We represent what the rest of the Cuban people want,"" They'll say, ""Look if we just start a revolution Fidel Castro will be overthrown."" The reality that came out, at least at that point in time, in early 1960's, Fidel Castro was actually pretty popular with the Cuban people and you can imagine he was at that time popular with the poor people who did not have land and now all of the sudden you have this leader for the people, I don't know about his popularity now but at that point he was probably a lot more popular than the exiles and the CIA would have had Kennedy believe."
Social Studies,"So they plan this attack Kennedy says oh, if we can get rid of Fidel Castro then that derisks the possibility of having this communist nation right off of the Florida coast. So they plan this invasion and you know it's shady to begin with because they didn't want to make it look like an official U.S. invasion."
Social Studies,"They wanted to make it look like a pure Cuban counter-revolution and to some degree that really mixed up everything and made it look, and well it really was suspect because they really were doing something that was not what it really was."
Social Studies,"But the invasion the way it all worked out is that by April 15th, and this is just going into the details of the invasion, So they had the fourteen hundred exiles They had some ships, some planes they marked them They either removed the markings so that it didn't look like they were American ships or planes Or they put false markings of the Cuban military So that it would cause some confusion or whatever So on April 15, 1961, Remember this is only a few months into Kennedy's administration, they start air attacks and these air attacks launch from Nicaragua and they go to Cuba."
Social Studies,"And the whole point of these air attacks was to kind of soften the Cuban Air Force for an eventual invasion by the 1400 exiles. And so they have eight aircraft, eight bombers leaving Nicaragua. They bomb Cuba at a base outside of Havana and a base near the south, actually not too far from the current Guantanamo Bay. And the point or their goal was to destroy the Cuban Air Force It turns out they didn't do it. And once again, to kind of cause confusion, they did it not under the U.S."
Social Studies,"markings, but they put Cuban Air Force markings on the planes. You had eight planes going and doing the bombing One of them gets shot down and a ninth plane actually leaves from Nicaragua and they falsely put bullet holes in it to look like it was hit with anti-aircraft guns and had it defect to Florida."
Social Studies,"So I guess the idea behind this was to make it look like there is a Cuban pilot who takes off from Cuba or somehow gets out of Cuba with a Cuban plane (that's why they put the markings there) and then tries to destroy a bunch of Cuban aircraft and then defects to the United States. That's the impression that they wanted to convey. It's not so clear that the Cubans actually fell for it. And so that happened in 1961. Most everyone kind of saw this as a U.S. attack, or at least said they viewed it as a U.S."
Social Studies,attack. Then you fast forward to the night of April 16th and this whole time everyone was expecting a US attack This all leads to the fact that this was not a well orchestrated series of events It's pretty well established that some of these exiles were just not as tightlipped as they should have been about the invasion. It got out to Soviet intelligence. The Cubans knew that an invasion was imminent.
Social Studies,"So on April 16th you have kind of a false attack - a decoy attack - at Bahia Honda right over here, with a bunch of decoy boats with loudspeakers on them that made it sound like they were firing to cause confusion and it did temporarily cause Castro to look in that direction because they were on hair trigger notice expecting an imminent invasion that was not the real one."
Social Studies,"This was on the evening of April 16th When you go to the early morning of April 17th you have the real invasion where you have the 1400 Cuban exiles with CIA and US military support (but all of that was hidden ) to actually invade at the Bay of Pigs. And to make a long story short it was kind of a invasion that did not go well. It has been blamed on bad planning, on incompetance at some parts of the invasion. The invasion lasted from April 17th which was the first day of the invasion."
Social Studies,"By April 19th the invading force, or counter-revolutionary force, the 1400 cuban exiles, had been pushed back to the beaches. And for the most part a little over 100 of them were killed and most of them, over 1000 of them, were captured."
Social Studies,"And then later on in the year Fidel Castro, - and some were executed after after being captured - but later on in the year Fidel Castro makes a deal with the United States where he hands over the captured exiles to the United States in exchange for $58 million in aid and supplies and all the rest. So this, at least from a military point of view, was a complete debacle from the United States point of view."
Social Studies,You can imagine after this happened people in the United States started pointing fingers You have the CIA (and this is Allen Dulles right here) and the exiles blaming the Kennedy administration saying that look he wasn't willing to do what it takes to actually do a proper invasion. He wasn't willing to supply the proper air support once the invasion started happening. He was not willing to commit more U.S. troops once the invasion started looking like it was not going in the direction of the exiles.
Social Studies,"Kennedy on the other hand blames the CIA. He says look this was just done and planned incompetently He also says that ""You gave me all sorts of misinformation."
Social Studies,"You told me that once the invasion started there was all sorts of resentment against Fidel Castro and it would cause this broader uprising, which never ever happened."" This is actually a quote from John F Kennedy that he said after the Bay of Pigs invasion: ""The first advice I am going to give to my successor is to watch the generals and to avoid the feeling that because they were military men their opinions on military matters were worth a damn."" This is John F."
Social Studies,"Kennedy saying this after the Bay of Pigs invasion. You can dig deeper and figure out who probably was in the right here, but the bottom line here is that it lead to all-round negative consequences for the United States. After this kind of strengthened Fidel Castro's hold on Cuba. He was like, ""Hey that was the United States' best shot."" Huge embarrassment for them. It allowed his to concentrate his control."
Social Studies,It also caused him to now become very openly communist Before the Bay of pigs invasion he was kind of trying to get the U.S. to somewhat like him. Although they wouldn't like him because he was taking over private property and he was clearly left-leaning. But after the Bay of Pigs invasion he definitely aligned himself closely with the Soviet Union.
Social Studies,"He became much more open about being a Marxist, Leninist, communist state and because he as afraid of future US invasions he was open to what eventually leads to the Cuban Missile Crisis which is the Soviet Union actually placing ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads in Cuba at short range to the United States. It set up this whole series of events that really didn't work in the U.S.'s favor.."
Social Studies,"Cuba is now a Communist nation right off of the coast of the United States. This is the middle of the Cold War. The U.S. believes in a strategy of containment, does not like this. So in 1961, the United States, the CIA, the Kennedy Administration, they try using Cuban exiles, people who have left Cuba, they try to support them to enter and invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. But, the whole effort wasn't planned properly."
Social Studies,"The support for the Cuban exiles, the counter-revolutionaries, those [who] were trying to oust Castro, it was kind of this half-hearted effort. And it was this big failure. So the Bay of Bigs invasion was a failure in 1961. And it made John F. Kennedy seem a little bit weak. It made the CIA seem [weak]. It didn't make anyone on the American side look all that competent, because of that failure. On top of that, we're in the middle of the Cold War, remember this."
Social Studies,"And at the same time, if you go to what the US was doing around the Soviet Union, it started placing missiles, starting [in] the late 50's, all the way into 1961 and 1962 --- it started placing medium-ranged ballistic missiles in Turkey and in Italy. These are where they were allocated. And the significance of that is that now these missiles could reach the major population centers of the Soviet Union in really a matter of minutes, in 10 to 20 minutes, I think."
Social Studies,"16 minutes was how long most of these stayed airborne. And in a situation where both sides have nuclear weapons, there was this kind of notion of well, maybe if you're able to get to the other guy faster, they wouldn't be able to retaliate, and maybe you wouldn't have that mutually assured destruction."
Social Studies,"So there's this whole idea that you want to get your missiles as close as possible [to your enemies] so that they could reach the populations centers, the strategic centers of your opponent, as quickly as possible. And if you look up on the Web, you can actually find the actual missile sites, and where they were installed, and when they became operational. These are the ones that were in Italy, kind of right here, near the heel of Italy."
Social Studies,"So you have this environment, the United States was looking a little bit weak after the Bay of Pigs invasion. It looks like they wanted to oust Castro, but they weren't able to do it. They weren't able because they were slightly inept. And at the same time you could imagine that the Soviet Union did not appreciate the United States placing these missiles so close to its population centers. Missiles that could reach its population centers very easily."
Social Studies,"So now, we fast forward to October of 1962 and the entire Cuban Missile Crisis will occur over 13 or 14 days during October of 1962. So, on the 14th of October we're sending these U2 spy planes over Cuba. So this right here is a U2 spy plane. That is a U2 spy plane. And it takes pictures that look like this. And on the next day, on October 15th, you have the CIA analysts. And they're saying, ""Wow - that looks like missiles over there."
Social Studies,"This looks like ballistic missiles that are being set up, that are being set up in Cuba"". And so all of a sudden, it looks like the Soviet Union is using Cuba to do the same thing that we used Turkey and Italy for, to set up ballistic missiles, really, right off of our coast -- and ballistic missiles that could now now reach any of the strategic population centers, especially on the east coast or the midwest of the United States. So by the 16th-- So this is literally two days after the pictures were taken."
Social Studies,"The next day, they're analyzing them, [and] they tell the State Department about them. [On] the 16th, they tell Kennedy about them, and Kennedy holds a meeting of the Executive Committee. It wasn't called ""ExComm,"" just [yet]. But it was really a subset of special advisors -- a subset of the National Security Council and other advisors that essentially become the brain trust to figure out what to do about this forming crisis."
Social Studies,"Because of all of a sudden you have a state that we don't like off of our borders -- a Communist state -- a state aligned with the Soviet Union. All of a sudden, it has nuclear missiles. it looks like these are offensive weapons. These are weapons being designed for a first-strike capability. Once again, if they're being launched from Cuba, maybe they can attack -- maybe they can obliterate the US before the US even has an opportunity to respond properly."
Social Studies,"So this really freaks out the Kennedy Administration. And so they start to think about what can they do about it and early on-- Well, there's a couple-- You could just kind of call and talk to the Soviets about it and say: ""Hey, we don't like that. Why don't you undo your missiles?"" But they didn't really think that that would have any significant effect on the Soviets. Especially, because they probably thought that Kennedy was weak at this point."
Social Studies,"And just to understand who was leading the Soviets at this time, it was Khrushchev. (This is Khrushchev right over here.) And he had even made remarks to the effect that he thought that Kennedy was young and may be naive, and maybe too intellectual to really play a good game of chicken here. And so the US kind of felt that it had to look strong here. And so the only real options on the table were: maybe blockade Cuba - and so a blockade could be an 'all out' blockade, so it would be an economic blockade."
Social Studies,"But then that's actually considered an act of war because you are, to a large degree, starving a country. Another option for the United States, (because it was completely viewed as unacceptable that these missiles should be here, and that they should be deployable from Cuba), the other option would be to do air attacks on these missile silos. And then the most extreme action would be to actually invade Cuba."
Social Studies,"And ,obviously that goes in line with, the US' general interest of not having a communist regime so close to its own borders. So, this is what Kennedy and his team was wrestling with. And really early on in these early days, most of the team was actually advising Kennedy that they should do a full-scale invasion of Cuba. They thought that this was the only thing that the Soviets would take seriously, it would show that the US is serious about this."
Social Studies,"And they didn't think that the Soviet Union would really try to put up a fight in Cuba, so far away from their own borders. But Kennedy, probably thinking about it pretty reasonably, realized ""Well, hey. They might not do anything in Cuba, and they might allow us to oust Castro and install a new regime there. But they might retaliate, in fact, they probably would retaliate in Europe, but specifically, in Berlin, probably in Germany as a whole."
Social Studies,"So, just for the sake of getting these things out of Cuba, we could sacrifice a lot in Europe. And even more, that any type of conflict between the US and the Soviet Union could easily escalate to a nuclear war"". So these were all on the table. The US goes on high alert. It prepares for any of these situations, because they really don't know what's going to happen. The Army, the Air Force and the Navy [start] mobilizing. So, on, kind of with hours notice, any of those options can, kind of, go into effect."
Social Studies,"By the 22nd, you have the Executive Committee -- (And that just becomes formalized as an actual, official group that is advising the President in this capacity.) -- and on the 22nd, Kennedy finally puts out his first salvo on what is the US' position on what's going on here."
Social Studies,"And before this -- just to make things clear -- on the 18th, he did meet, he did meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andrei Gromyko -- and I'm sure I'm butchering the pronunciations -- and this is where the first time, Kennedy is like ""Hey, you've got these offensive weapons..."" And Gromyko is insisting that ""No, they're just defensive weapons""."
Social Studies,"And, to most people, defensive weapons would mean things like surface-to-air missiles, things that would stop planes from bombings. But not surface-to-surface missiles, not something that could attack a country. But we'll see, in future letters from Khrushchev, that maybe they actually did perceive these missiles as somehow being defensive. But you fast forward."
Social Studies,"That was on the 18th, it kind of made, it made Kennedy and the US frustrated with the Russians, because it felt like the Americans are saying, ""Look, we clearly know you have missiles there"", but Gromyko is saying ""No, these are just defensive weapons - nothing to worry about. Why are you taking this so seriously?"" The 19th: US goes on high alert. It starts thinking about all of these options. The 22nd: this Committee is formed formally."
Social Studies,"But more importantly, Kennedy gives a speech to state the United States' opinion. And I'll just read it right here: ""To halt this offensive build-up, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargos of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers."
Social Studies,"We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life, as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948."" So, the Kennedy administration's position became slightly more nuanced. They said ""We can't do an all out blockade. 1) That is an act of war; 2) That is, to a large degree, inhumane. Why should we starve the Cuban people? What we're gonna do is, kind of a filter on the cargo going into Cuba."
Social Studies,"We will only inspect things that we suspect are holding armaments, and we will only turn back the ships that are actually doing it."" But then on the 24th, there is a cable from Khrushchev, and it say,: ""If you cooly weigh the situation which has developed, not giving away to passions, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot fail to reject the arbitrary demands of the United States -- and that the Soviet Union views the blockade as an act of aggression, and that their ships will be instructed to ignore it."" So the game of chicken is beginning to emerge."
Social Studies,"The United States if just saying ""Look, this is unacceptable. We're gonna stop you from shipping arms to Cuba."" On the 24th, Khrushchev is saying ""Who are you to tell us what to do?"" and, you know, there's this kind of under current like, ""Wait, you've already got stuff set up in Italy and Turkey, not too far from us."
Social Studies,"How can you dare..."" -- (you know, and they call it a blockade, even though the US is calling it a quarantine) -- ""this is an act of aggression and we will ignore it."" So both parties are kind of saying, ""We don't care what you're gonna do. We're gonna do what whatever we have to do"" And this whole time, both sides are getting tense, the whole world is kind of taking sides, they're making public statements about what's right or wrong."
Social Studies,"So, we really are getting very close to the brink of a very major confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States. And you know, you can read the book ""13 Days - Robert Kennedy"", there's also the movie ""13 Days,"" which actually is not based on the book. But both of them really kind of give the account of what happened over this period. But then you fast forward to the 25th and Kennedy essentially replies, ""Look, these are offensive weapons and these require the responses I have announced."
Social Studies,"I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit restoration of the earlier situation."" Ok, so he's saying - ""Look, we have to do this. These are offensive weapons. We cannot tolerate these weapons so close to US borders. And so, also on the 25th, the quarantine is in effect. It does get challenged. The US does start to inspect some ships. They try to inspect one ship that got away a little bit. So the Soviets, even though they're speaking the game of chicken, they are turning back."
Social Studies,"They did turn back 14 ships. And the best guess is that those 14 ships probably did contain some type of armament. So even though, publicly, everyone is playing a very strong game, behind the scenes, there is a little bit of a softening of the stance. And then you fast forward to the 26th, and Khrushchev essentially sends his first proposal. And it's interesting here. Because, in Khrushchev's mind -- (And this is a fascinating letter to read."
Social Studies,"It's a fairly long letter, so I'm not gonna go into the whole thing and you can get it at this URL right over here. It's a fascinating letter. Maybe I'll do a whole video where I just read this letter.) He kind of goes into the nuance of what he views as a defensive or an offensive weapon. He implicitly admits that the missiles are there -- That they're not these benign weapons. But, in his letter, he kind of makes the nuance that he'd use them as defensive weapons."
Social Studies,"He says: ""Look, you guys attempted to oust Castro already. We view Castro as an ally. We think that by placing these weapons here, that you will be less likely to be able to oust Castro, because you will be afraid of these weapons."" So, Khrushchev is kind of setting up-- Kruschev is saying, ""We don't have the intention of using these to attack you for no reason. We're just putting these here to essentially defend one of our allies."" So he's saying that's the reason."
Social Studies,"That's the reason that they placed those weapons there in the first place. He's kind of saying ""Look, you did Bay of Pigs. You were the ones that took the first shot. Now we are defending it."" That might have been the rationale. Another rationale for why they did it -- and it's just, and probably the more strategic rationale -- is that we already did have these missiles that were pointed at the Soviet Union in Turkey and Italy. And the Soviet Union just wanted to have parity."
Social Studies,"So, they wanted to put missiles near the US [in] some ally's country, from the Soviet Union's point of view. So, on the 26th, Khrushchev's first proposa,l that was given through a cable, says: ""If assurances were given by the President and the Government of the United States that the USA itself would not participate..."" - so 'assurances'..."
Social Studies,"(Let me underline this in a different color.) -- ""assurances that the USA itself would not participate in an attack on Cuba, and would restrain others from actions of this sort"" -- probably the Cuban exiles -- ""... if you would recall your fleet, this would immediately change everything. I am not speaking for Fidel Castro, but I think that he and the government of Cuba evidently would declare demobilization and would appeal to the people to get down to peaceful labor."
Social Studies,"Then, too, the question of--"" (And, you know, the Communists always like talking about ""labor."") -- ""then, too, the question of armaments would disappear, since, if there is no threat, then armaments are a burden for every people."" So in this first proposal that came over a cable, he's essentially saying: ""Look, if you guys just promise not to attack Cuba, if you just make 'assurances' that you will not attack Cuba, then we'll essentially undo everything."
Social Studies,"We'll give in to your wishes."" And this stance right here really does make it look like their main interest in having those missiles was, kind of, to protect Cuba -- so that the US would not try to oust the Communists from there. But then on the next day, Khrushchev has a public broadcast where he kind of changes his tone a little bit. Now he's saying that they would undo the situation in Cuba only if the United States removed their missiles from Italy and Turkey. So, he's sending little mixed messages."
Social Studies,"His first message was kind of a softer stance: ""Look, you guys just promise not to invade Cuba and we're gonna pull out of Cuba."" The second stance is saying: ""No, no. We're only gonna take our missiles out of Cuba if you take your missiles out of Italy and Turkey."" And on the same day, another U2 spy plane gets shot down over Cuba. This is when both armies are really at, kind of, they're at hair-trigger notice, it's a really scary situation."
Social Studies,"And this was actually done by-- It was a local decision by a Soviet commander. (And Khrushchev actually did not want this to happen.) And lucky for, I guess, the world, the US did not use this, alone, as a reason to engage in war. They said: ""Maybe it's an accident. If this happens again, then we'll use it as [a pretext for] war."" So it was lucky that this did not trigger an immediate war with the Soviets."
Social Studies,"But the Kennedy Administration still had the question: ""Which of these was a more serious, you know, which of these requests were the Soviets really making? This is a more significant request."
Social Studies,"Are they requesting for both? And so it was eventually decided, on the 27th, that: ""Hey, let's just pretend like we didn't even know -- that the Americans didn't even know about the second request that asked for more -- and let's just reply to this first request."" So, you essentially have Kennedy agreeing [with] Khrushchev, and saying: ""Ok, we'll do your first request. We will agree not to invade Cuba if you remove your missiles."" And then, essentially, what happens--."
Social Studies,And that puts Khrushchev in a weird situation. (Because this is something that he did recommend.
Social Studies,"But they were ignoring this over here.) But through back channels we said ""Well, we'll offically agree to this."" But through back channels the Kennedy administration said: ""And we would also be on an understanding, we will also have an understanding on the missiles in Italy and Turkey."" That, ""Look, this isn't part of the deal, but we see what you're saying and we're probably, we're probably going to remove them."" And what the Soviets also didn't know at that time is that the Americans were planning on -- that these missiles, to a large degree, by this point in time, were already obsolete."
Social Studies,"Because we already Polaris missiles that were deployable by submarines. And clearly, submarines can deploy things much closer to the action, and they're much harder to track. You can't surveil them and all the rest. So the US kind of agreed to it. But they did it secretly. And the whole point here is that neither side wanted to look like they're giving in. Neither side wanted to look weak. But on the 28th, there was finally an agreement."
Social Studies,"And so, publicly, the first Khrushchev proposal was agreed to by both Khrushchev and the United States. Khrushchev agreed to remove -- to not send any more weapons, and also dismantle the weapons that were there, and the Americans agreed that they would not invade Cuba. So you can imagine the big winner here. The big winner here is probably Fidel Castro, because the whole time he's paranoid that the US is planning another attack on him."
Social Studies,"And, at least publicly now, they're saying that they cannot invade him. And if they did, it would like they're going back on their word. And privately, the US agreed to remove its missiles from Turkey and Italy. They didn't wanna do this publicly, because then it would like they were being weak. Then it would like the Soviets were able to do this aggressive action. And by doing it, they were able to extract something out of the United States. Which is actually the reality."
Social Studies,"They were able to -- By doing this action, they were able to get these missiles removed from Turkey and Italy. But the United States wanted to look strong. Kennedy has, well -- there's always an approaching election. Especially after the Bay of Pigs, he needed to look like a strong leader. And so, to some degree, you have to give Khrushchev credit for this. He kind of swallowed his pride and allowed it to publicly look like he lost the negotiation."
Social Studies,"He publicly made it look like he got nothing in return for backing down, but in reality he did. He just didn't necessarily get credit for it. But this was a big deal. Because this was the closest that the Soviet Union and the US ever got to really the brink during the Cold War.."
Social Studies,"And France stayed the colonizing power-- I have a little gap in my timeline here-- and they stayed a colonizing power all the way through World War II. And so you can imagine, during World War II, France was quickly overrun by the Germans. The Vietnamese wanted their independence, and so you have a liberation movement that rises up. And it was led by the Viet Minh, and the Viet Minh were led by Ho Chi Minh. This right here is a picture of Ho Chi Minh."
Social Studies,"And besides being a liberation movement, they were also communist, which, you could imagine, later on during the Cold War will kind of bias the United States against them. But you fast forward through World War II. Eventually, the Japanese take control over Indochina, over Vietnam. But by the time '45 rolls around, or at least the end of '45-- and we know that the United States defeats Japan-- now, all of a sudden, the Viet Minh are able to declare a somewhat temporary independence."
Social Studies,"And it's temporary because shortly after that-- and the region is occupied temporarily by the Chinese in the north, and the British in the south, who were part of the Allied forces against the Axis. But eventually, you have the French coming back, and they want to reassert their control over their former colony. And you have this war that develops-- the First Indochina War between the French and the people sympathetic to the French-- the Vietnamese who were loyal to the French-- and the North."
Social Studies,"And the French-- just to make it clear how it sets up, at the end of World War II when you had the temporary occupiers, the British and the Chinese, the Chinese, obviously, had more influence in the North. The British had more influence in the South. When the French come back they, essentially, are able to reinstate control over the South. So right when the Indochina War is beginning, the French already have more control over the South."
Social Studies,"And actually, historically the French had more influence in the South, as well. During French colonial rule it was really the southern third of Vietnam where you had a lot of French influence. And this is a current map, and the current map does not have this orange boundary over here that we'll talk about in a second. Vietnam is now unified. But before the Vietnam War, this was not Ho Chi Minh City, this was Saigon. And Saigon was kind of where most of the French control was centered."
Social Studies,"But you fast forward to 1954, this ends up in a bit of a stalemate. And so you have the Geneva Conference of 1954 that partitions Vietnam along the 17th parallel between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. And the whole point of this partition was, really, to just allow for a cooling off period, a period where you can have thing settling down, and then having elections. It wasn't meant to be a permanent partition. But there was a 300-day period where people could move across the partition."
Social Studies,"And during that partition, you actually had 900,000 people, mainly Catholics, move from the North to South. You also had several hundred thousand people moving from the South to the North, so it wasn't a one-way movement. But net net, most of the movements by Roman Catholic Vietnamese was from the North to the south. You fast forward a little bit, you eventually have-- and I'm sure I'm butchering the pronunciation here-- Ngo Dinh Diem take control."
Social Studies,"He starts off as prime minister in '54, eventually he takes control, and becomes president in '55. This is him right here. He takes control of South Vietnam, and this guy is not a big fan of things like elections, or non-corrupt government, and all the rest. And he takes control of South Vietnam. But you could imagine that the United States is positively inclined to him. One, he dresses in nice Western suits and all of that, and had nicely combed hair. But he was also anti-communist."
Social Studies,"And at this time period, the United States is starting to think in terms of the Cold War. And in terms of, how do we stop communism? How do we contain it? This whole theory of containment-- that the best way to stop the Soviet Union is to just make sure that communism can not spread. That it gets contained. We have the domino theory in the United States that if one country falls to communism in a region, that the rest of the countries will eventually fall. And that is not good for containment."
Social Studies,"So we did not want South Vietnam to fall. We essentially start supporting these characters over here. And even from the early '50s, the United States starts supporting the anti-communist. And at first, this support, it's in the-- I guess we should say-- the guise of advisers. But these advisers-- one, we start sending more and more aid, and more and more advisers. And these advisers started getting more and more involved in the actual conflict."
Social Studies,"And so after this partition, you can imagine, that you still have an ongoing conflict between the North and the South. And on top of that, you have actors who are sympathetic to the North, sympathetic to the Viet Minh, sympathetic to Ho Chi Minh, in the South. Some of them were in the North, they come back to the South. Some of them were just in the South. And they did not like the Diem government."
Social Studies,"Besides just being sympathetic to Ho Chi Minh, Diem was a fairly corrupt autocratic ruler, who wasn't a big fan of democracy. And so these players in the South who started to rise up against President Diem or the Viet And so this really sets up what the Vietnam War is all about. You have the communist Ho Chi Minh-controlled North that was fighting a conventional war against the South. You have this partition on the 17th parallel."
Social Studies,"And on top of that, you have an unconventional fighting force-- I guess you'd call them guerrillas-- in the South of Vietnam called the Viet Cong. So it was, kind of, a double-- There were two things that the South had to fight against-- the North officially, and also this insurrection that was occurring within the South. And so the whole time the United States did not want this insurrection to succeed-- they did not want all of Vietnam to become communist. We keep sending more and more advisers."
Social Studies,"It actually started even before Kennedy, but Kennedy he starts sending-- he escalates the number of advisers that gets sent. It's still not, at this point, it's still not a formal war. We haven't officially declared-- where we don't have, officially, soldiers in battle. You fast forward to 1963, besides all of the great characteristics of Diem that I already mentioned, he also was into persecuting Buddhists."
Social Studies,"So to make matters worse, not only was he corrupt, not only did he not like elections, but he liked persecuting his own people. And by 1963, this kind of got out of hand, his level of persecution of the Buddhists. He started toward storming temples, and all the rest. And so he was assassinated. And not only was he assassinated, it kind of leaves this power vacuum, and you have all these people jockeying for control, none of these really especially savory characters inside the South."
Social Studies,"These two guys eventually come to power, Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu. Wait a few years, Nguyen Van Thieu is able to get this guy out of the picture. And then by 1967-- I don't have it over here-- you have Thieu has now taken control. But during that period-- or actually, before Ky and Thieu take power-- in 1964, you have one of the shadiest incidents in American history."
Social Studies,"As you can imagine, we, in our function as advisors, we had sent ships into the Gulf of Tonkin, right off of the coast of North Vietnam. So the original story goes-- and this is a very suspect original story-- in 1964, the US Maddox-- and this is the original story-- claimed to that it was attacked, or it was claimed that the US Maddox was attacked by North Vietnamese patrol boats, and that there was a little skirmish-- there was an exchange of fire."
Social Studies,"And it was also claimed that a few days later another boat in the Gulf of Tonkin, another US vessel, was attacked by a North Vietnamese boat. That was the original story. This angered Congress, this angered the American people. How dare they attack ships that are sitting off of the coast, warships that are sitting off the coast. And so this kind of gave the emotional fuel to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution."
Social Studies,"So these incidents, or these purported incidents-- this, kind of, attack on the USS Maddox, and this other thing that might have happened-- these were called the Gulf of Tonkin Incidents. This angered Congress, angered the American people, so we passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, and what's relevant about it is that it gave LBJ, here, it gave him the authority to officially engage in a war in Vietnam, to officially escalate it to an actual war that the US was involved in."
Social Studies,"And this whole time I've been saying it's shady, because it's now been shown that one, the Gulf of Tonkin-- well it's not clear that really anything happened. There might have been some firing from the USS Maddox. They might have actually engaged the North Vietnamese patrol boats. The other possibility that might have happened is that nothing happened. But any way you look at it, it's now been fairly established that it was not a real incident. It was not really North Vietnam attacking the United States."
Social Studies,"But it was relevant because it really escalated the war. So now you have Johnson-- did I say North Korea originally? I apologize for that. We're talking about North Vietnam. I don't remember what my brain actually said. Of course, North Vietnam. But it gave Johnson the power to escalate the war. And so his administration is really the heart of the Vietnam War, when the war was really escalated. We eventually get to 500,000 US troops."
Social Studies,"But the whole time this is happening, you can imagine, Johnson and the American military leaders in Vietnam are telling the American people, oh, we're fighting communism. We're about to win. This is a noble war."
Social Studies,"And you fast forward, and especially, the part about to win-- you fast forward to 1968, and all of a sudden you have the Viet Cong, who the American leaders have told the American people and the Congress, that they're about to be defeated, and then in 1968, the Viet Cong orchestrate the Tet Offensive, which is this massive coordinated attack on a bunch of targets throughout South Vietnam."
Social Studies,"And so even though it was wasn't completely successful militarily, the intent of the Tet Offensive was to completely turn the tides in the war. It made the American people and the Congress rightfully suspicious. You, Mr. Johnson, you had told us that we were about to win the war, and the Viet Cong were almost defeated, and all of a sudden, they orchestrate this sophisticated attack on us. It rightfully made the American public suspicious."
Social Studies,"On top of that, and this probably made matters a lot worse, the My Lai Massacre comes out. And in every war there are massacres, but the United States, at least believes, that its soldiers can kind of take the high road. They don't engage in these type of things. But the My Lai Massacre showed that, really, no soldiers are immune to massacres. And this is really a disgusting massacre, and it was documented. And if you really want to be disturbed, do a Google search for images of the My Lai Massacre."
Social Studies,"It will ruin your weekend. It'll depress you. It's US soldiers killing a village of innocent women and children. There's pictures of dead babies. It's horrible, and to make matters worse-- or even, add insult to injury-- the soldiers who committed it-- there was actually a few who tried to defend the villagers and when they came back, they were treated almost like traitors."
Social Studies,"But the soldiers who actually did the attack, only one of them got jail time and it was only a couple years of jail time, and this was for massacring a village of women and children. So already, you had the Tet Offensive. It makes the American public suspicious of whether we can even win this war."
Social Studies,"Then you have the My Lai Massacre, which just disgusts the public, and makes people realize that we're involved in a war that it's not even clear who are the good guys anymore, not even clear what the real goals are. Make matters worse, you fast forward to 1971. The Pentagon Papers get leaked to the New York Times."
Social Studies,"And these pretty much articulate-- it's a classified document that articulates that the leadership, the military and non-military leadership of the Vietnam War, was, to some degree, lying to Congress and the American people. It was lying about how the war was going. It was lying about what activities it was doing. It did not tell the American people and Congress that it was actually engaged in war in Laos and Cambodia."
Social Studies,"And a lot of the reason why we were engaged in Laos and Cambodia is because that's where the supply routes were between the North and the South-- they ran through Laos and Cambodia. And the most famous of them, and you might have heard of it, is the Ho Chi Minh trail. And it wasn't just one trail, it was actually a network of trails. And so a lot of the activity that was going on in Laos and Cambodia was, kind of, carpet bombing of what the US thought were some of these supply routes."
Social Studies,"And we never really got a good-- well, that's a whole other debate. But it wasn't just one trail the was easily bombed. It was all of these little foot paths and all of these other things, where arms were able to be transported from the North to the South. But the Pentagon Papers, rightfully, made the American people even more suspicious."
Social Studies,"And then now we're entering into Nixon's administration, and he was still doing the carpet bombing, still atrocities going on, but he, his whole goal was to kind of wind down the war, bring the troops out on a timetable without, kind of, an unofficial defeat. So you fast forward to 1973, you have the Paris Peace Accords, where officially there is peace between the North, the South, the North, and the Americans."
Social Studies,"You can imagine it from the North's point of view, they're like, sure, we'll sign some peace accords. It'll just make the Americans go away, once the Americans go away they won't be able to come back, since this was such a hugely unpopular war. It was such a waste for America on so many dimensions. Especially, America's prestige as a global actor. We'll just wait for them to leave, and then we can overrun the South after that. And that's essentially what happens."
Social Studies,"In 1975, the North just overruns the South, and then later that year, you have Saigon falling to the North. And then it becomes Ho Chi Minh City. And just this whole period, you have President Thieu is in power, and just to show where his priorities are-- near the end, right when the North is falling to South Vietnam-- and you can kind of see the writing on the wall-- he gives a speech to the Vietnamese people saying that he'll never desert them."
Social Studies,"But then when it becomes pretty clear that Saigon is going to fall to the North Vietnamese, he gets on a big US transport plane with, literally, 15 tons of luggage. I'll let you think about how much luggage that is. And $15 million worth of gold, and this is $15 million worth of gold in 1975. So you can imagine how much he really cared about the Vietnamese people. And he eventually ends up settling in Massachusetts. And he died there about 10 years ago."
Social Studies,"So you could imagine, this was an ugly incident for the world. A super ugly incident for the Vietnamese people. A super ugly chapter in American history. It was the first war that one, America lost, but more, it hurts prestige, it hurts America's ability to influence what was going on in other parts of the world. You had the containment theory, that we have to stop communism from spreading. And the domino theory, that if one country would fall to communism then the other ones were. That didn't happen."
Social Studies,"The South did fall, but we didn't have the rest of Southeast Asia falling to communism. So it kind of disproved the domino theory, especially because after the Vietnam War the United States would not be able to enter another war like it for some time, because the American people wouldn't let it happen. So to some degree, it would have been easier for communism to spread, because people would have known that the US couldn't engage it. But despite that, the domino theory didn't happen."
Social Studies,"But it was just all-around ugly. I mean, besides the massacres, and the raping, and the pillaging of innocence that happened on, really, on all sides of this, you have 1 to 3 million Vietnamese-- and no one will really know the actual count-- but that's a huge number. 1 to 3 million Vietnamese were killed. You have 58,000 American troops being killed. And you have hundreds of thousands of Cambodians and Laotions who are never really formally involved in the war, they were killed."
Social Studies,"Especially, due to a lot of this carpet bombing campaign. So these are just atrocious numbers, and really one of the worst and ugliest chapters in US history.."
Social Studies,"A sense of optimism in the future and a conviction that American economic prosperity was endless was tempered by fears of nuclear annihilation and a war on poverty. A foreign policy based on democracy and anti-communism, abroad, was undermined by the suppression of civil rights and civil liberties, at home. Material comforts and Leave It To Beaver visions of suburbia clashed with growing calls for young people to tune in, turn on, and drop out."
Social Studies,"Would the generation that fought World War II even recognize the generation that protested Vietnam? That's the question I'd like to explore, in this video, taking a high-level look at the impact the events of the postwar era had on reshaping American national identity. How much did American national identity change, and how much did it stay the same, over this time period? To answer this question, first, we have to define what we mean by American national identity."
Social Studies,"In other videos, we've looked at a few aspects of American identity as core ideological beliefs about things like who counts as an American, whether the United States is exceptional, or whether it's possible for anyone to succeed, so long as they work hard enough."
Social Studies,"So if we're trying to track continuity and change in American identity, over the period from 1945 to 1980, what might be a few beliefs we should trace, over time? I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can come up with a couple, based on your knowledge of the events in this time period. Some big events that jump out to me are the Cold War and the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the protests of the 1960s."
Social Studies,"So with that in mind, the core beliefs I'd like to look at are ideas about the United States' role in the world, who counts as an American citizen, and the country's cultural values. You might have come up with a totally different set of beliefs, which is great. Try out this same process I'm about to model, using the beliefs that you've chosen. Now that we've got a few aspects of national identity we wanna track, let's compare each of them at the beginning of this period to the end of this period."
Social Studies,"Remember, we're doing a super, high-level overview, here. So I'm not gonna take a whole lot of time to explain events in detail. But if something comes up that you're unfamiliar with, just make a note, and you can look it up when you've got time. All right, let's see what changed and what stayed the same, over this period, in beliefs about the United States' role in the world. In 1945, the United States emerged as a world superpower, having abandoned isolationism as a foreign policy."
Social Studies,"Instead, the United States became a leading member of the United Nations and the NATO defensive pact. The U.S. government was determined to contain the spread of communism and the influence of the Soviet Union through providing military and financial support to nations fighting communism, which would lead to American military engagements in Korea and Vietnam."
Social Studies,"The United States also had a lot of confidence in its economic role in the world as the only country whose industrial might hadn't been compromised by World War II bombings. Immediately after the war, the United States was the world's leading exporter of steel, cars, consumer goods, and oil. How does that compare to beliefs about America's proper role in the world in 1980? Well, the United States was still a world superpower at the end of this era."
Social Studies,"And it was still pursuing anti-communism as a foreign policy. But in the 1970s, the Cold War entered a period of detente, a relaxation of tensions and increase in cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. You could see this as the U.S. government accepting peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union. This approach will change when Ronald Reagan comes into office in 1981. But the period of detente lasted until the end of the 1970s."
Social Studies,"The Vietnam War shook American confidence in its interventionist foreign policy. After the war, there was more reluctance to commit U.S. troops, abroad, in what's been called Vietnam Syndrome. Likewise, the Nixon Doctrine called for U.S. allies to take primary responsibility for their own defense. Lastly, U.S. economic world dominance was threatened, in the late 1970s, as well, as Japanese and German automobile makers began competing internationally."
Social Studies,"And the energy-dependent United States found that its energy needs were increasingly tied to the oil exporting countries of the Middle East. So in terms of what changed and what stayed the same, from the beginning to the end of the postwar era, I would say that although the United States remained a world superpower, committed to supporting its allies and opposing the spread of communism, by the end of the 1970s, the country looked to establish some limits to its intervention in world affairs."
Social Studies,"Next, let's look at how beliefs about citizenship changed during this period. After the shared experience of G.I.s in World War II, European immigrants who had been looked upon as dangerous others, in the 1920s and 1930s, were accepted as U.S. citizens and categorized as simply white, not Polish or Irish or Russian. But African American soldiers, who had served in segregated units during the war, weren't afforded the same courtesy."
Social Studies,"Despite Truman's executive order desegregating the military in 1948, black veterans encountered racial discrimination after the war, along with difficulty accessing the government subsidies for education and home loans that white G.I.s took advantage of. The immigration restrictions that set national origin quotas in the 1920s were still largely intact, although the Chinese Exclusion Act had been repealed during the war as China was a U.S. ally. Chinese Americans were then eligible to become U.S. citizens."
Social Studies,"However, the new quota for Chinese immigrants was just 105 individuals per year. What were the beliefs around citizenship at the end of the postwar era? A lot changed during this time period, thanks to the Civil Rights Movement, Supreme Court decisions like Brown versus Board of Education, and legislation like the the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. At the end of the '60s, African Americans were able to access more citizenship rights than they ever had, before."
Social Studies,"And, in 1965, Congress repealed the old national origin quotas and passed new immigration laws, allowing Asians to enter the country as well as prioritizing family reunification and the entrance of skilled immigrants. But in the late 1960s and 1970s, there was a backlash against the civil rights policies set by the Supreme Court, in the Johnson administration."
Social Studies,"With many conservatives arguing that the federal intervention to advance civil rights had gone too far, and with some left-leaning organizations arguing that it hadn't gone far enough, to address issues like housing and job discrimination, looking at the changes and continuities in beliefs about citizenship over this period, I'd say there was an enormous expansion, over time, in who was considered a citizen or eligible to become a citizen of the United States."
Social Studies,"But there was also a growing antagonism toward the federal government intervening on behalf of civil rights. Last, let's look at American cultural values, at the beginning and end of the postwar era. In the years after the war, there was an emphasis on domesticity and family life. And women were expected to give up their war time jobs and seek fulfillment through motherhood and consumption. The United States began a postwar economic boom that looked virtually unstoppable."
Social Studies,"In fact, the American standard of living doubled in the 25 years after World War II. There was also a lot of pressure for Americans to conform to a homogenous, mass culture, idealizing the white, suburban, nuclear family. Fear of communist infiltrators led to witch hunts, like McCarthyism. But few people people questioned the wisdom of the U.S. government or authority figures, in general. Compare that to the end of this period, after the tumult of the 1960s had turned American culture on its head."
Social Studies,"In the 1960s and 1970s, the sexual revolution and women's rights movement challenged the idealized, nuclear family, allowing for a more permissive sexual culture and the advancement of women in jobs and education. Starting as early as the 1950s, the Beat Generation began to question the emptiness of the single-minded pursuit of wealth that was the American Dream."
Social Studies,"In the 1960s, students began to protest the draft and the military industrial complex, more generally, wondering what the United States was even doing in Vietnam. They vowed not to trust anyone over 30. By the 1970s, public confidence in the U.S. government was also at an all-time low, after revelations about presidential misdeeds exposed by the Pentagon Papers and the Watergate scandal."
Social Studies,"To add insult to injury, the endless economic boom finally seemed to be at an end, by the 1970s, with deindustrialization and stagflation, increasing prices and unemployment. So it seems like American cultural values changed a great deal, from 1945 to 1980, from a culture of suburban conformity to one of greater personal freedom but also greater cynicism. But it is important to note that the people of the United States didn't fully reject the premise of the American Dream."
Social Studies,"Despite the counterculture of the 1960s, by the 1970s, most people were still looking for a good job and hoping to buy a nice home. If we return to our question, then, how much did the events of the postwar era reshape American identity? I think we can respond that they reshaped it quite a bit. The Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, and the protest movements of the 1960s led to a U.S."
Social Studies,"national identity that was considerably more inclusive and socially free, but also a good deal less confident about its government or its role in the world. To see how these forces played out, in the next stage of U.S. history, we'll have to look to the 1980s.."
Social Studies,"How can we examine something that's so close to us in time? We're still in this era. It doesn't have a name, not like the Gilded Age or the Revolutionary Era, at least not yet. Maybe this is the post-Cold War era or the post-9/11 era? Maybe it will be defined by the changes brought by technology and we'll call it the Information Age."
Social Studies,"Trying to think historically about the present gives us a better understanding of what it was like to live in the past, to not know what was coming next or how to interpret all the complex threads of politics, society, and culture weaving together around you. Life is messy and confusing. We don't know if we're living in a tragic era or a triumphant one, neither did the people who lived in 1940 or 1860 or 1770."
Social Studies,"So years from now when historians write about the period from 1980 to 2020 in the United States what will they say? Well, let's pretend for a few minutes that we are those historians from the future. Maybe we're living on a space station a few hundred years from now enjoying a Raktajino by the Replicator and discussing the United States at the turn of the 21st century."
Social Studies,"Would we be discussing a golden age or a dark period? Let's apply some of our historical thinking skills to this era and see if we can determine what effects changes in this period had on American national identity. First, let's talk about America's role in the world."
Social Studies,"In 1980, the United States was still locked in a Cold War with the Soviet Union, and when Ronald Reagan took over as president he moved the country away from the policy of Detente, or relaxation of tension, kind of live and let live with the soviets that was pursued in the 1970s towards a more active, anticommunist stance. The end of the decade saw the collapse of the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"So after more then 40 years of foreign policy that was aimed at containing communism and the influence of the Soviet Union, capitalism and democracy were now the dominant economic and political systems, and the United States was the world's lone superpower. After the Cold War ended it wasn't immediately clear what the new US role in the world should be. Should it return to an isolationist stance like it had before World War II."
Social Studies,"Should it serve as the world's police officer keeping the peace and countering the actions of hostile powers that might try to arise. During the 1990s, the United States had a few limited engagements abroad and the Gulf War, the United States defended Kuwait from an Iraqi invasion, and it sent troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping force. But the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001 on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C."
Social Studies,"began a new era of American foreign policy. US President George W. Bush articulated what's been called the Bush Doctrine which asserted that the United States has the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups. So under this doctrine, the United States went to war with Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 after those countries refused to surrender Osama bin Laden and the terrorists responsible for September 11th."
Social Studies,"The war in Afghanistan became the longest war in US history continuing through 2019. At the end of this era from 1980 to 2020, Americans were continuing to debate the proper US role in the world."
Social Studies,"Should the United States withdraw from wars abroad to save the lives of American troops and the massive budget expenditures of war? Or would leaving the Middle East further destabilize the region and lead to even bigger problems in the future? Some questions that we might think about in the broader scope of US history, how does the Bush doctrine compare to earlier presidential doctrines on foreign policy like the Nixon Doctrine, the Truman Doctrine, or even the Monroe Doctrine? And how does the war in Afghanistan compare to the United States' second longest war, the war in Vietnam."
Social Studies,"The end of the Cold War and the rise of the war on terror weren't the only major changes in this time period. There were also far-reaching social changes. How work was done, how much people were paid for it, and who did that work. In the late 20th century, the emergence of the personal computer and the internet made it possible to communicate and to do business all over the world in an instant. At the same time, barriers to trade fell between countries."
Social Studies,"In 1994, the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA to reduce or eliminate tariffs on trade goods between the United States, Mexico and Canada. The growing international interdependence of business and the mixing of cultures that business carries along with it is called globalization. But the availability of cheap goods and cheap labor that globalization made possible also had some economic consequences for American workers."
Social Studies,"Manufacturing generally moved overseas to take advantage of lower wages and regulations and union membership fell to a record low. Meanwhile, the share of Americans working in service-oriented jobs rose. The largest employer in the United States in 2019 was Walmart. Wages have stagnated for low and middle class American workers while wages have soared for the richest Americans."
Social Studies,"A study by the federal reserve found that although the total net worth of US households more than quadrupled between 1989 and 2018, most of those gains were for the wealthy, with the top 10% of households controlling 64% of overall wealth. The top 1% alone controlled 32%. Another social change of the late 20th and early 21st century was the growth of immigration. The 1965 immigration act ended national quotas in immigration which had barred immigration for most countries other than Western Europe."
Social Studies,"As a result, immigration from Latin America, Asia and Africa grew changing the racial demographics of the United States. Some of the biggest questions of American politics at the end of this era concerned the effects of globalization and immigration."
Social Studies,"Putting this in a broader historical context we might ask how did the developments in this time period compare with say the Second Industrial Revolution in the Gilded Age when new manufacturing technology opened up many new factory jobs, and lured many immigrants to American cities, but also bred great inequality of wealth. Politics in this period also differed sharply from the era that came before it."
Social Studies,"From 1932 to 1980, liberal ideas had dominated American politics that government should be active in securing the welfare of people, and that taxation should pay for those initiatives. But there was a growing conservative movement starting in the 1960s and Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 began a period of limiting government regulation and lowering taxes. And when democrat Bill Clinton took office in 1993, he largely adopted that same stance."
Social Studies,"He declared that the era of big government is over and reduced welfare benefits significantly. The 1990s saw the emergence of the culture wars. Battles over the growing multiculturalism, secularism, and cultural acceptance of non-traditional marriage and family relationships. Many conservative Christians feared that the traditional American nuclear family with Christian, heterosexual married parents was disappearing."
Social Studies,"Meanwhile, liberal progressive celebrated the growing acceptance of LGBTQ citizens in diversity and public life. This was also a time of bitter partisan divisions with citizens not only more strongly identifying with one party but increasingly vilifying members of the other party is immoral or unpatriotic."
Social Studies,"To put this in a broader historical context we might ask, do these partisan divisions suggest that American national identity was fractured beyond repair or that a party realignment was underway? How does this period compare with the 1850s when the beliefs of the north and south diverged sharply over the institution of slavery? These are very difficult question and I'm glad we're here in the 23rd century enjoying the benefits of hindsight to assess that strange period from 1980 to 2020.."
Social Studies,"The characters in American history, all the way through, are fascinating, just, human beings. They would make great movie characters, period: heroes, villains, people who rise to courage when they were otherwise pretty boring people. Look at Abraham Lincoln, for example. He failed miserably repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly. Then he becomes the greatest President."
Social Studies,"And when he's almost at the end of his, well, he doesn't know it's the end of his life, but later in life, after he's had his greatness, he says, ""I confess that I was like a cork in a stream."" Well, if you're a regular person and you think, ""My life feels kinda without a purpose,"" you can think, well, the greatest President in America felt like his life was kind of bouncing around."
Social Studies,"And so, that is an incredibly human connection to greatness, and we all need connections to greatness of whatever kind to inspire us. Because the questions today that America faces about freedom and liberty and what it means to be an American, and how the power is distributed throughout our governments and our lives that affect us today were discussed and talked about and wrestled over all throughout American history. And it is a continuing experiment."
Social Studies,"And when Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, he said, ""This new country that we're creating ""has to constantly refresh, each new generation ""has to refresh their contact ""with the original ideals that the country was founded on."
Social Studies,"""Otherwise, the country will fail."" And so, it's not only important to know what's going on around us by studying history, but it is, according to Thomas Jefferson, your duty to stay engaged with the ideas of America so that those ideas don't get lost in the kind of flurry and craziness of a current moment.."
Social Studies,"And so the first real successful settlement in what's now the United States was at Jamestown. That's Jamestown, Virginia right over here. And it was 1607. It was set up as kind of a commercial settlement and then shortly after that, and we always learned this in school, you know the pilgrims on the Mayflower, sailing the oceans blue and all the rest. They were kind of the next major settlement in the New World. Or I guess we should say the next major successful English settlement."
Social Studies,"There were obviously the Spanish and the Portuguese were already settling the New World with a good bit of success at this point, but we're talking about the English settlements. And so the pilgrims settled what's now Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620. And obviously from 1620 until the mid-1700s, you just had a huge influx of people migrating and cities developing. But I'm going to fast forward all the way to the mid-1700s."
Social Studies,"So this is actually a huge amount of time that I'm just not providing any details over. Because I'm really just quite focused on the major events in American history. And so this is a 130-year period where things were just getting built out more, they were getting more developed. And I'm going to fast forward to 1754, because at this period you had essentially the entire east coast of what's now the US."
Social Studies,"These were the 13 colonies of the-- well, they're not the United States yet, they're the 13 British colonies. But these are English settlements, and then if you go a little bit to the northwest from there, you have all the French settlements. And obviously still in these parts of Quebec and Canada, people speak French. But you had the French settlements up in this area over here. I'm not going to go into the details."
Social Studies,"Each of these can be a whole series of videos, and hopefully in the future I will make them whole series of videos. But you fast forward to 1754, and you start having the French and the British start getting into squabbles over territory where Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is right now. In 1754. And that starts the French and Indian War. And I want to be very clear here because this is maybe one of the biggest points of confusion when people first learn American history."
Social Studies,"Since it's called the French and Indian War, they think it's between the French and the Indians. But it's not. It was the French and the Indians against the British and the colonists. So in this war, the British and the colonists were on the same side against the French and the Indians. And obviously there were some Indians that were also on the side of the British, but it's called the French and Indian War because these were the people that the British were fighting against."
Social Studies,"Now if anyone outside of the United States talks about the French and Indian War, they will not call it the French and Indian War. They'll really just call that the American theater of the Seven Years' War because it eventually evolves into a much bigger conflict between Great Britain and France that's going on in Europe, and the French and Indian War was really just the American theater of it. So between-- the French and Indian War starts in 1754 based on these disputes over Pittsburgh."
Social Studies,"But that wasn't the only thing. You had all of these other things, all of these other tensions that were developing. The thing that starts the war is never the only factor. It's always just the tipping point. But that leads to a bigger war in Europe. And that's the Seven Years' War that starts in 1756. And they both end because they're really the same war. They both end in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris. Treaty of Paris, 1763."
Social Studies,"And the big takeaway of that is that really most of what France had in the New World now becomes essentially a part of the British Empire, now becomes British colonies or British territories. And even Louisiana goes over to Spain at this point. And we'll see it goes back to France for a little bit in 1800, and then it goes back to the United States in 1803, but we'll see that in a second. So 1763, the British-- it was this huge costly war-- but they were able to win."
Social Studies,"And at least from the point of view of the British, they felt that the main beneficiaries of this war were the Americans. They were able to get all this new territory, all this new area that they can now trade with, or they could now potentially settle. And so the British decide to start taxing the Americans to recoup some portion of the cost of the war. So in 1765 they pass the Stamp Act. And this wasn't a tax on stamps."
Social Studies,"What this was is that they essentially declared that a whole set of paper that had to be used in the New World. So the stuff for legal documents, stuff that maybe even newspaper. That that paper would have to be produced in Great Britain, and it had to have a special stamp on it in order for the contracts or whatever was on top of it, in order for them to be legitimate. So essentially it was a huge tax on paper and on documents. And essentially, this is what societies ran on."
Social Studies,"So it was just a way to extract money from the colonists in order to, I guess, help pay back some of the costs that the empire felt that they had incurred on behalf of the colonists. You could debate whether who was the main beneficiary, but regardless you could imagine this didn't make-- this whole period over here-- the colonists weren't happy. Especially because they didn't have any representation in Parliament. This was done without anybody from the colony saying, hey, wait I don't think that's fair."
Social Studies,"Or this is fair or whatever. And so you fast forward. 1773, you have the Boston Tea Party where you have a bunch of people who, for whatever reason, and there's multiple interests here. But there was three ships in Boston Harbor full of tea and the tea was owned by the East India Tea company. And they decide, in protest, and there was a whole series of acts and other taxes that went back and forth, but once again, we're not going to go into the details here. But in revolt they dumped the tea."
Social Studies,"They dressed up as Indians, as American Indians, and they dumped the tea into Boston Harbor, and then you could imagine well that was kind of a very exciting act for the colonists, but it didn't make the British very happy. And then after that, they passed the Coercive Act. They essentially did a blockade of Boston. So things started to get really, really, really tense in the early 1770s."
Social Studies,"And then you fast forward to 1775, you have essentially the first conflicts of the American Revolutionary War, and we're going to do a whole series of videos on really the whole Revolutionary War. 1776, you have the Declaration of Independence. This is them right here drafting the Declaration of Independence. And that's really just saying, hey, we've had enough of you Great Britain! We are now declaring ourselves as an independent country. No more of this colonies business."
Social Studies,"And so all the way until 1783 you have the American Revolutionary War. And once again, you can do a lot of videos on this, but I'm just going to go over it just so you have a sense of when everything happened and when everything ended. And we can later dig deeper into the scaffold. And it ends with the Treaty of Paris. The US becomes a free independent state. And then you fast forward. Until this point, the US has been governed by Congress, and the Articles of Confederation."
Social Studies,"But the Constitution that we have now, it was drafted in 1787. It was ratified-- it had to get at least nine of the states to ratify it-- that happened in 1788. And then it went into effect in 1789. So it depends what you consider the birth of the country. Well, it would definitely be the Declaration of Independence, but the country in its current form, with its current institutions, with this current constitution, started in 1789."
Social Studies,"And that was also the beginning of Washington's first of two terms as president, and those ended in 1797. And then John Adams comes into the picture. And the reason why I put this-- obviously this is actually the only president that I showed-- is that it was actually very important that he decided to step down after two terms. He was hugely popular. If he wanted to, he probably could have become one of these characters that stick around maybe a little bit longer than some people would want."
Social Studies,"So it was really good that he set this example of stepping down after two terms, and that he wasn't this kind of power hungry dude. You fast forward a little bit more. 1803, I mentioned that after the French and Indian War what's Louisiana-- I want to be clear when I say Louisiana. Louisiana isn't just what's the current state of Louisiana. It's this whole region that includes the state of Louisiana, but all the way up to roughly what the United States' current border with Canada."
Social Studies,"And after the French and Indian War, all of this business over here went to Spain. And then in 1800, it went back to France. But then in 1803, Napoleon had a bunch of stuff that he-- his Naval fleet was destroyed, he had a suffered some defeats in the West Indies, I guess we could call it. In particular in Haiti, and he said, well, you know I probably won't be able to control this territory anyway, so he sold it to the United States for what turned out to be a very, very, very cheap price."
Social Studies,"But it was kind of like, it's not like he could have protected it anyway. The United States might have been able to take it from him without him being able to do anything. So he might as well get some money for it so that he could fund his battles in Europe. So in 1803, the United States almost doubled in size. It went from these territories that it had after the American Revolution for Independence, and now it got all of this region over here in 1803. Then you fast forward a bit."
Social Studies,"And the War of 1812, it's an interesting one, because there weren't any really serious outcomes from it. But what was interesting about it, this whole time period, even after independence, the British continued to harass America. They continued to arm Native Americans who would maybe revolt or cause trouble for settlers. They would impress American seamen-- and when I say impress, it didn't mean that they were doing something special."
Social Studies,"It meant that they were-- impressment of seamen meant that they were taking over these boats, taking the sailors, and forcing them to become part of the British military. So they were doing a whole series of things that was really kind of antagonizing the United States. In 1812, the United States declares war on Great Britain. You have the War of 1812. It ends in 1815 with the Battle of New Orleans. But there wasn't any real transfer of a territory or anything like that over here."
Social Studies,"What was good, some people call it the Second War for American Independence, is it really asserted that America was here to stay, or I should say that the United States was here to stay. That the Revolution wasn't just some fluke that isn't some just fly by night country. It was able to defeat one of the greatest empires in the world again. So it's kind of here to stay. Now you fast forward a little bit more. This part of what we would call Texas, this area right over here."
Social Studies,"It was, before 1836, it was part of Mexico. But the Mexicans actually encouraged English-speaking settlers-- these would be American English-speaking settlers into the area-- just because it was very sparsely settled. But these English-speaking settlers, a lot of them were slave owners, and then as we kind of go up to 1836, the state of Mexico that this was all governed by, they were thinking about abolishing slavery. So you can imagine that the settlers there, they didn't like this idea."
Social Studies,"So in 1836, you had the War for Texas Independence, and that's where you remember the Alamo, and all of that. And then the first president of Texas is Sam Houston. That's why Houston is named Houston. And then you fast forward all the way to 1845. And in this time period, you have this whole talk in the United States of Manifest Destiny, that it's part of our God-given destiny as Americans, to one day extend our territory all the way to the Pacific Ocean."
Social Studies,"So people were already eyeing a lot of the territory. Remember all of this territory, this was Texas. And Mexico still viewed it as their territory, even though it was being governed independently by the people who called themselves the Republic of Texas. And you had all of this territory that was Mexican territory."
Social Studies,"So people were starting to eye this and say, wouldn't it be nice to get a little bit of that? So in 1845, and this was in agreement with the settlers in Texas, with the Republic of Texas, the United States annexed Texas. The settlers there wanted this to happen, so wasn't a forced annexation of Texas. But Mexico was not so happy about this because Mexico still viewed Texas as part of their territory."
Social Studies,"And America, to some degree, depends on how you view it, it seems like they kind of wanted to goad Mexico into war, so they sent military really close to the border of Mexico, even into some territory where Mexico might have had better claims to it or-- I'm not going to take sides on this, but it seemed like there was some instigation going on. And there's some debate about the actual course of events. But in 1846 you have war actually breaking out between Mexico and the United States."
Social Studies,"And by 1848, the United States essentially trounces Mexico, and most of the war actually does go on on Mexican land. And because of that, Mexico cedes over all of this area. So, California and all of the rest of Nevada, Arizona, what the part of New Mexico the didn't come along, that the United States didn't already have. And along that same amount of time, you both had the British and the Americans that were eyeing this territory, the Oregon Territory up here and it even included part of Canada."
Social Studies,"And eventually they were able to resolve it relatively peacefully, and what they agreed is, is that the Americans would get all of this territory. And the British would get everything north of this line right over here. And that's why Vancouver and British Columbia and all of that, is Canada now. It stayed as part of the British Empire for a little bit longer. So by 1848, the Manifest Destiny essentially had happened."
Social Studies,"The United States had gotten everything from California all the way from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast. And clearly I'm really just covering the high levels, 30,000 level foot view of American history here. This whole time you had this tension developing. From the birth of the country through the election of Abraham Lincoln, you have this tension over slavery. A lot of people in the North didn't like it on moral grounds."
Social Studies,"A lot of people in the South didn't like it-- well, they wanted slavery regardless of what they thought of it morally-- the South's economy, to a large degree, was based on slavery. And so all of this, the tipping point happened in 1860. Where Abraham Lincoln, who was pretty vocal about the fact that he did not like slavery, that he wanted to curb the spread of slave states. And up to this point, you had all of these compromises every time a state came into the Union."
Social Studies,"The slave states wanted it to be another slave state. The free states wanted it to be another free state. So you always had this people kind of jocking for whoever could have the most states on their side of the camp. But all of this pro-slavery and anti-slavery hit a tipping point in 1860 when Abraham Lincoln, who was fairly vocal about not extending slavery, he was elected. Then a bunch of what we now consider southern states seceded from the Union. And then in 1861 in South Carolina."
Social Studies,"South Carolina said, hey, we are not part of the United States anymore, but there was still a United States military garrison there, so they attacked it. That started the Civil War. And so during the Civil War-- it lasts until 1865-- Abraham Lincoln makes the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which essentially proclaims all the slaves should be free. This lays the groundwork for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. And then unfortunately, he dies two months before the end of the Civil War."
Social Studies,"But in 1865, the South surrenders and so they're not able to secede. And essentially, we no longer have slavery in the United States. So I'm going to leave-- and it's fascinating, and just to give you a sense of things, here's the map. The navy blue are the Union states, the northern states, the light blue are the territory controlled by the northern states. This orange color are the states that seceded from the Union, the Confederacy."
Social Studies,"And this light orange, these are territories that they controlled, but they were disputed. These yellow states right here were members of the Union. They didn't secede from the Union. They didn't join the Confederacy, but they were slave states. But probably the most fascinating thing about the Civil War, other than the fact that it ended slavery in the United States, that was probably its biggest thing, but it was also the bloodiest war that ever happened in the United States history."
Social Studies,"During the Civil War-- and these are unbelievable numbers-- 18% of white males in the South died. 18%, almost one out of every five white males in the South, died during the Civil War. And for the North, it was slightly better. It was 6%. But still, a huge percentage of the men in the United States died fighting the Civil War.."
Social Studies,"And we enter a period called Reconstruction, and Reconstruction can refer to one of two things and they're somewhat related. One is just the Reconstruction from the war. Obviously there was a lot of damage done on both sides. But it's usually referred to the actual Reconstruction of the South and to some degree, kind of the reform of the South. I'm going to glaze over a lot of details, like I did in the last video. I might ignore some major events that you might find important."
Social Studies,"And I'll get back to them, don't worry. But the three big things that happened during Reconstruction, other than the fact of the North occupying the South and essentially, to a large degree, suspending democracy in the South and installing its own politicians, its own lawmakers, is that the United States passed the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. These are known as the Reconstruction Amendments. In 1865, you have the 13th Amendment and this abolished slavery. Let me write this here. This ended slavery."
Social Studies,"We talked about the Emancipation Proclamation and that was essentially Abraham Lincoln's executive order, this was a speech he made. But now it became official law in 1865. Then in 1868, you have the 14th Amendment which made everyone, every person born in the United States a citizen, and this includes the freed slaves, so it's kind of like, the slaves are now free and they are also citizens. And then in 1870, you have the 15th Amendment which gave all free men the right to vote."
Social Studies,"And obviously, now all men were free. There were no non-free men. So, the right to vote. And I emphasize the men because even at this point, women did not have the right to vote. The right to vote."
Social Studies,"And the 14th Amendment also introduced a due process which, I won't go into the details here, but it essentially said, ""Look, the government has to go under a due process ""where it's subject to its own laws when determining ""whether it can take away property from ""or in some way, ""infringe on rights of other people."" But we'll probably do a whole video on that in the future. But these were the real takeaways. So it really brought the former slaves, at least by law, by these amendments, on equal standing."
Social Studies,"But we know that in practice, that didn't happen. And you fast forward to 1877, and you essentially have the Reconstruction period formally ending. The occupation of the South formally ends. And as soon as the occupation of the South formally ends, and democracy comes about, you have a bunch of people coming to power. And at this point of time, the Republicans were essentially the North, and these were the people who were anti-slavery. Abraham Lincoln was a Republican."
Social Studies,"And the Democrats come to power in the South. And we can talk about how the different perceptions of the different parties change over time. But at this point, as soon as the occupation ended, and I put democracy in quotes because even in this period, the North has essentially not occupied anymore, but the elections, these were things that were heavily contested. You have both sides of them exerting force. And in particular, you have the Jim Crow Laws being passed in the South."
Social Studies,"And they're called the Jim Crow based on this parody in the early 1800s. It was a practice for white men in the South at this time, or even well before this, in order to parody blacks they would paint their face black and they would act silly and all of this. And Jim Crow was the name of one of these characters that was portrayed in the early 1800s. I think it was Jumping Jim Crow, was the name. That's where the laws come from. But the Jim Crow Laws essentially segregated blacks and whites in the South."
Social Studies,"Even though the idea might have been that they were equal, the reality were that the conditions for blacks, the places that they were separated to, were far inferior. They had to use separate drinking fountains, they had to use separate bathrooms. They couldn't sit in the same parts of theaters or in the same parts of buses. And these lasted all the way until the Civil Rights Movement, all the way to the 1960s."
Social Studies,"Now, at the same time that all of this was happening, you kinda had this post Civil War boom in the economy, where you had this massive building of the railroads and steam engines. To some degree, it was the first, well, I don't wanna say the first. There was many ages of mass innovation. But all of these things tend to always lead to a little bit of a bubble."
Social Studies,"And then in 1873, what you have happening is a lot of the governments of the world start going off of the gold and silver standard, and they go to the gold standard. And what then happens is, is that anyone who's left on the silver standard or partially both, the gold and silver standard, their currency would devalue. And back then, it was viewed as an unambiguous negative for your currency to devalue. We can later talk about that, there's more nuance there. So the United States decide to follow suit."
Social Studies,"And actually, the big actor here was Germany that decided to go off of the silver standard and going on pure gold standard. And so the United States decide to follow suit with the Coinage Act in 1873. But this leads to a huge, they call it the Panic of 1873. There's a couple of things here. One, it completely demolishes the price of silver, although this was already happening on a global basis. It hurts the silver miners and the industries associated with the silver miners."
Social Studies,"But I guess more importantly, now this restricts the money supply. And I won't go into all of the economics of it. When you restrict the money supply, you essentially increase interest rates, and it essentially popped the bubble that was forming due to the railroads and all of the booming business. And then you essentially have the United States entering a depression. And that depression lasts from 1873, when the Coinage Act and kind of this bubble burst, all the way to 1879."
Social Studies,"But lucky for the United States, after that time period, after it recovered from the depression, it actually recovered at this super fast rate, and this was one of the fastest economic growths in US history. You had this huge influx of immigrants, tens of millions, from Europe. And by 1890, the United States was now the richest country in the world on a per capita basis, which is amazing because only a hundred years ago, it was kind of this colony of Great Britain, or part of the British Empire."
Social Studies,"It was kind of this thing that the European powers didn't view as that relative. But now it was the richest country in the world. And then you fast forward to 1898. And it starts to, essentially, become a bit of an empire. Until this time, United States kind of kept to itself. It wasn't really interested in controlling other nations or other people. But in 1898, until 1898, Cuba was a Spanish colony. And there had been many revolts try against the Spanish by the Cubans."
Social Studies,"And the United States, or the Americans, were fairly sympathetic to the Cubans. After all, here's another country in the New World, again, trying to revolt against a European power. And the Spanish were pretty infamous for cracking down pretty hard. So in 1898, while there was a revolt against the Spanish, the United States set some ships over to Havana Harbor, essentially to protect American interests."
Social Studies,"This might resonate a little bit relative to maybe the Mexican-American War, that we kind of send things close to another country to protect our interests and make sure nothing crazy happens. Then while in Savannah Harbor, not Savannah, while in Havana Harbor, you have a battleship, a US battleship called the Maine, the Maine, that explodes and sinks. And this is an actual picture of it. This is fun because we're entering the point in history where pictures start to become relevant."
Social Studies,"Although, even in the mid 1860s, you had pictures. That's a picture of Abraham Lincoln. The Maine gets sunk. The people who wanna declare war on Spain say, ""Hey, Spain must've blown up the Maine."" Although it's still a complete mystery on what was the actual cause. Some people say it was just a random explosion. There's even conspiracy theorists who believe that the United States did it to itself intentionally to justify entering the war, while some say, ""Hey, no. Spain did it for whatever reason."
Social Studies,"""It didn't like this American fleet in Havana Harbor."" But regardless to say, after this happened, it allowed, it made the American public angry, the American government angry, and they declared war on Spain. And it was actually a very short-lived war. They won pretty handedly. The big takeaway from the Spanish-American War is that the United States essentially became an empire. It started to have control of other countries, and in particular, it had temporary control of Cuba."
Social Studies,"But it also, because it won, it got control of Guam, which is right over there, and it still has control of Guam. It also got control of the Philippines from Spain, and it maintained control of the Philippines until the end of World War II. And it got control of Puerto Rico, which is still part of the United States. It's not an official state but it is United States territory. So at this point, the United States becomes an empire. And then you fast forward to 1914. War breaks out in Europe."
Social Studies,"I need to do a whole series of videos on World War I. But war breaks out in Europe. Particularly, the two strongest powers that are really at each other at this time period, are the British Empire and Germany. You have this situation where United States is trying its hardest to stay neutral. Obviously, the American people were predominantly of English descent, it's an English speaking country. So there were some sympathies for the British Empire, for Great Britain. But they wanted to stay neutral."
Social Studies,"But what you had happening is that the British had a blockade of the Germans. They really had a strangle hold. And the Germans wanted to have a blockade of the British because Great Britain was an island. It was an island, it could really maybe win the war if it could somehow strangle the island, if it could blockade the island. But unfortunately for Germany, it did not have as strong of a navy. So you get close to 1917, actually 1915, 1916, 1917, Germany starts to get desperate."
Social Studies,"So it sends its submarines into the Atlantic. They say, ""Well, if we can't blockade Great Britain, ""at least maybe we can start harassing ships ""or even blowing up ships that are trying ""to trade with Great Britain and that'll make people ""afraid to, it'll essentially be the equivalent ""of a blockade."" And at first, Germany does some minor things. But as the war goes on, it gets more and more desperate."
Social Studies,"It gets more and more desperate, and it starts attacking civilian ships, cruise liners, Americans start dying because German u-boats are just willy-nilly, just essentially torpedoing ships. So the US doesn't tolerate it anymore, enters the war in 1917. Germany didn't take the United States that seriously up to that point. But it learned, and we'll do a whole series of videos on this, that it should have."
Social Studies,"And then you fast forward to 1918, and the United States was definitely one of, the British were doing alright, but the United States really turned the tides. No one really expected how large of a power they had essentially gotten involved in the war. Then you fast forward to 1918 and the war ends. The real takeaway of this, I mean there's a bunch of these and we'll talk more about this in depth in future videos, is that it ended some of the nations that were on the losing end."
Social Studies,"Austria-Hungary no longer was a nation, at least in this form. The Ottoman Empire no longer was a nation in this form. And as we will learn later, there were huge reparations by the victors on Germany, and that to a large degree, may have led to World War II. But we won't talk in depth about that right now. The other things that started to happen at this point, in 1920 you have the 18th and the 19th Amendments being passed."
Social Studies,"The 18th enacted Prohibition, where all of a sudden, you made alcohol illegal in the United States. And you know the irony of it is, that's when you have all of these movies about these bootleggers and you have this whole crime scene that develops around illegal alcohol. But at the same time the 19th Amendment was maybe a little less controversial. And the 19th Amendment, it finally gave women the right to vote. Right to vote."
Social Studies,"And one of the arguments against having women the right to vote before this time was, ""Hey, you know, only men are fighting for the country. ""Only they have the right to vote. ""Only they can be soldiers."" But during World War I, and this happened not just in the US, this happened worldwide in World War I, that because so many men were fighting, women really had to take up the slack domestically."
Social Studies,"And they, essentially, were a big part of the war effort in terms of just working at the factories and producing things. So that was probably one of the big things that, on kind of a global basis, all of a sudden, women started to get the right to vote. Also, at this period, you have in the 1920s, you have another post-war economic boom that really develops into a post-war economic bubble all the way until 1929."
Social Studies,"And then you have the stock market crash, and then I think some of us know that, after that period, the Great Depression ensues. And the Great Depression continues. And this was a global Great Depression, and it continues all the way to the US entry in World War II. And I'll leave you there.."
Social Studies,"But I want to back up a little bit, because I forgot to mention a very important fact that's hugely important to the rest of US history into the 20th century. And that's what happened in 1917, actually during World War I. And that's the Bolshevik Revolution. The Russian empire was overthrown by the Bolsheviks."
Social Studies,"And it became the Soviet Union, which you probably know was a communist state, and it became the United States archenemy over the rest of-- well, not over the rest of-- but near the, I guess, the second half of the 20th century. So with that out of the way, I just want to make sure you know that Russia is now the Soviet Union. Let's fast forward back through the Great Depression, and probably the one point when we're doing this very high-level overview that's of interest."
Social Studies,"And as you can see, even though the focus of this series of videos is on US interest, what's happening in the rest of the world is starting to become much more important, because the US is starting to become this really serious global actor. And so in 1933-- so this is right in the middle of this global depression, and Germany was especially hit hard because of all the damage done by World War I and the war reparations and all the rest. You have Hitler coming to power as chancellor of Germany."
Social Studies,"And it's interesting to note that it was actually-- he came to power in a democratic process. Chancellor of Germany is analogous to prime minister of other countries, and so essentially he was ruling a coalition. The Nazis, his party, did not have the majority. But they were able to control this coalition. Although it was a very weak one. But what they were good at is intimidating and rigging elections and all the rest."
Social Studies,"And so over the course of the rest of the '30s, essentially the Nazis consolidated power until we get to 1939. And the rest of the world would kind of watch Hitler. He was consolidating power. He came in democratically, but he was essentially consolidating power under himself, turning it into a dictatorship. He was militarizing Germany. People started to get concerned, but they all had the doctrine of appeasement. Hey, you know, let's just not make him too angry and maybe he won't start anything too bad."
Social Studies,"But in 1939, Germany invades Poland. And this is kind of viewed as the one event that kind of-- the straw that breaks the camel's back, so to speak. And so it begins World War II. So this is the beginning of World War II. And initially it's between-- I guess if you think about the great powers that initially get involved, it is the British Empire and the Soviet Union. France is involved. It quickly gets overrun by the Nazis."
Social Studies,"And what happens is that the US-- it wasn't like the situation with World War I where the US was trying to stay neutral. The US had recognized, especially FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he had recognized that Hitler was an aggressor, that he was, from FDR's point of view, definitely in the wrong So even from the beginning of World War II, the US did help support the Allies. So it would send arms and any other type of assistance."
Social Studies,"When Japan and Italy joined on the side of Germany, the US embargoed oil to Japan. The US was an exporter of oil to Japan. And you could imagine Japan did not produce a lot of its own oil, and oil is super important when you're trying to run a war machine. So that didn't make Japan too happy. So you fast forward to 1941, and you have Japan bombing Pearl Harbor. So until this point, US kind of played a non-direct role. It definitely supported the Allies."
Social Studies,"It did what it could economically and by providing military aid, but it did not actively participate in the fighting. But then December 7, 1941, the Japanese bombed the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor. And that's a whole interesting debate because, or discussion, it was lucky for the US that a lot of the Pacific fleet was not there. But it was obviously this thing that convinced the US public that World War II was worth joining. So in 1941, because of Pearl Harbor, the US enters the war."
Social Studies,"And it enters the war in both arenas, both in Europe and in the Pacific. And then you fast forward. It goes against the Italians in North Africa. And then you fast forward to 1944, it actually enters into the fight in mainland Europe. This is the invasion of Normandy. This is D-Day. June 6, 1944. If you have ever seen ""Saving Private Ryan,"" it starts with this. I've never stormed a beach, but I could imagine that's probably the most realistic reenactment of what it was like to storm the beach at Normandy."
Social Studies,"But you fast forward to 1945. And eventually, especially between the Soviet and the US, or I should say all the Allied forces, they're able to, I guess, win the European front of World War And then you fast forward to the end of that year. Japan was still kind of fighting pretty ferociously. And so the US-- and this is once again-- I could make many videos of this. We can debate the ethical implications of this."
Social Studies,"But the US develops the atomic bomb, ignites one over Hiroshima and then a few days later one over Nagasaki. And that essentially ends World War II. And so the outcome of World War II is you have two remaining superpowers. You have the Soviet Union, and you have the United States. And what happens after that is that you have the Cold War. These two huge powers, the Soviet Union is this communist country. It's obviously trying to create this communist sphere of influence."
Social Studies,"A lot of Eastern Europe was falling under Soviet sway. The United States, not a communist country, a very capitalist country, you can imagine. And this is something that gets confused a lot. The Soviet Union was communist, and it was totalitarian. Communism and Democracy aren't necessarily things that go against each other. But the Soviet Union had neither a capitalist system, nor democracy. It was both communist and totalitarian. And when I say communist, I'm talking about no private wealth."
Social Studies,"The state really owned all resources. The United States, on the other hand, was hugely capitalist. And you could imagine many people in the United States did not want any of this communism business to come to us. So you have this major battle that never really erupts into direct conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States."
Social Studies,"It's always done through proxies, through people who the United States or the Soviet Union is acting on the behalf-- or who are acting on behalf of the United States or Soviet Union. But you have the Cold War beginning. And it's called the Cold War because it wasn't a hot war. The United States and the Soviet Union never really fired bullets at each other. Instead, they supported other parties that would fire bullets at the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"Or the Soviet Union would support other parties that would fire bullets at the United States. And for the United States, it was all about stopping communism. It was all about preventing this domino theory that if one country in a region would fall to communism, that other countries would. So the United States became a bit paranoid, or maybe it was justified. Either way, it was very concerned about the spread of communism."
Social Studies,"And the first time that this really gets tested-- and 1950 is an interesting year, because this is the first time-- obviously, the US had nuclear weapons as of 1945. But in 1950, the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon. So now the Cold War is starting to get very serious. Both of these adversaries can now nuke each other if they wanted to. And also in 1950, you have Korea. And Korea, before World War II-- so that's a very small depiction of Korea-- it was a Japanese colony."
Social Studies,"But obviously, Japan had now lost. And so after World War II, it was split between an area, North Korea, which was influenced by the Russians, and South Korea, which was influenced by the United States. And it was split along the 38th parallel, and I know this is a super small diagram. We'll go into more detail when we do detailed videos about the Korean War. But in 1950, you have the North Koreans invaded the South. So it started the Korean War. The US sent troops."
Social Studies,"The North Koreans had China on their side, the Chinese army. The Soviets were also supplying them. But at the end of the day in 1953, you fast forward, it ends up being a little bit of a stalemate, because the end result was is that the original 38th parallel border gets, I guess, reinstated. But that was the first real conflict of the Cold War. And notice there were never US or Russian-- or I shouldn't say Russian-- US or Soviet troops directly firing at each other."
Social Studies,"The US were at war with the North Korean and the Chinese troops, but they were kind of proxies for the Soviet Union. And at the same time, as you can imagine, because you have these two adversaries, these two technically sophisticated adversaries-- they both had nuclear weapons-- it became very interesting on who can kind of dominate space. So you have this kind of space race developing in 1957. The Soviets are able to launch the first artificial satellite around the earth. This is Sputnik One over here."
Social Studies,"Some people think the first Sputnik is the one that had the dog in it. No, that came a few months later. That was Sputnik Two, actually. Had the picture of the dog here, but the dog eventually dies. But it was alive for a little bit in orbit. So that gets everyone freaked out. The US responds. Then in 1961 you have Yuri Gagarin. He's the first person in space, first human being in space. He returns safely. We eventually get up there-- or the United States eventually gets up there as well."
Social Studies,"And you fast forward all the way to 1969, the US is the first to be on the moon. So you have this space race. The two countries are really trying to one up each other. And at the same time that that's happening, you have-- and I bring this up just because so much happened during his presidency. In 1960, you have John F. Kennedy being elected kind of in the heart of the Cold War. And the other interesting thing is he was the first Catholic president, which people questioned. That by itself was interesting."
Social Studies,"But what was really interesting in his short presidency-- and I think you might know that only had really-- he actually became president in '61. This is an error. He was elected in '60, but he became president in '61. He had a very short presidency. He was assassinated in '63, but a lot happened in that short presidency. In 1957, right before he became president, you had-- oh, sorry. Not 1957. Let me get my years right. 1959 you had the Cuban Revolution. Cuba became communist. Fidel Castro takes over."
Social Studies,"It becomes communist. So you could imagine, the Americans didn't like a communist state so close to our own borders. So in 1961 we support some ex-Cubans, or some Cuban exiles, to try to invade Cuba. And that also can be a whole topic for another video. There's debates between the CIA and the Kennedy administration for who was to blame for it being such a failure, but it was a failure. So it was a huge embarrassment to the United States."
Social Studies,"And from the revolutionaries' point of view, the communist revolutionaries' point of view, they kind of viewed this as solidifying their hold of Cuba. It showed that they could fend off a counter-revolutionary assault. And then you have in 1962. We have these spy planes. And we see that the Soviets are starting to put these ballistic missiles in Cuba, which really freaks the United States out, because these ballistic missiles could reach any part of the United States."
Social Studies,"We actually had similar ones in parts of Europe and Turkey, but we don't like these things here. So we essentially used our Navy to, I would say, blockade any more arms shipments to the Soviet Union. So Kennedy really has this kind of stand-off with the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. And most people believe that this was the closest that the United States and the Soviet Union ever got to actually having a war, and which would have probably turned into a nuclear war."
Social Studies,"But the stand-off eventually got resolved. The Soviet Union agreed to remove their missiles. Well, one, not send anymore missiles and dismantle the ones that they had already set up. And this wasn't publicly stated at the time, but the United States also agreed to do the same thing for our missiles that were pointed at the Soviet Union, to remove those from Turkey. So the world, at least at that point in time, had avoided a mutually assured destruction."
Social Studies,"The whole time that this is happening, remember, the United States is paranoid. And maybe justifiably so. Paranoia usually means worried when there's not a cause. But maybe justifiably worried about the spread of communism. You have a situation where, in Vietnam, you have a Vietnam, which is right about-- let me make sure I circle the right country-- you have in Vietnam the communists come to power in North Vietnam. This was formally a French colony."
Social Studies,"The US, right from the get-go in 1950, start sending advisers to aid the anti-communists in South Vietnam. In Kennedy's administration, the amount of advisors-- and I should probably put that in quotes, because these advisers started becoming much more involved-- really grew. And until 1965, the United States started sending it acts actual official combat troops to fight in Vietnam. And you fast forward that all the way to 1975."
Social Studies,"And the reason why this is significant, other than this being one of the more recent major wars the United States has been in, it's the first war that the United States kind of unambiguously In 1975, the last presence of the United States left. And essentially Saigon, which was the capital of South Vietnam, fell to the communists. So I'll leave you there, and we're now essentially in modern history. At least from my point of view, because I was born not too long after that."
Social Studies,"Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting. Let me, oh, I couldn't find the stop button. There you go.."
Social Studies,"Although it wasn't formally done, there was still some fighting going on in some parts of the South. So if we go back to April 9, 1865 you have the battle at Appomattox Courthouse, and after that battle the Confederate army is essentially routed. It has to surrender. This right here is Robert E. Lee. And on April 9, 1865 after that battle, he surrenders to Ulysses S. Grant."
Social Studies,"And one point of confusion some people often have, and I had this the first time I learned it, is that Appomattox Courthouse is the name of the city, that the surrender actually did not take place in the courthouse in that city. And I actually shouldn't even call it a city. It's like a little town with a handful of buildings. It took place in this gentleman's house, Wilmer McLean. And I'm showing his image because, his set of circumstances or how he is tied to the Civil War, is frankly fascinating."
Social Studies,"Because in 1861 the first battle of the Civil War occurred on his property in Manassas, Virginia. This is in northern Virginia. He was sympathetic with the Confederate army. He did not like that northern Virginia was so close to the North-South border. So he picks up his bags and his family, and he moves them down to the small town of Appomattox Courthouse, which is in central Virginia. So the very first major land battle of the Civil War literally occurs on this guy's property."
Social Studies,"And the last major or really the major surrender of the Civil War occurs inside this guy's house after he moves. And it's all coincidence. He just happens to have the nicest house near the battlefield where everyone felt that it was appropriate to have this kind of major end to a major war. But regardless, that happens on April 9, 1865. The major Confederate army surrenders to the Union army."
Social Studies,"The reason why this is not the formal end of the Civil War is that you still had 175,000 Confederate troops other places in the south continuing to fight on. You have to remember that we didn't have a telephone at this point in time, so we didn't have instant communication. So these people who were fighting, many of them did not even know that the Confederate army had already surrendered to the Union. But to some degree this major surrender is what leads to Lincoln's assassination."
Social Studies,"Because for most people this tells you, hey, there's a 99.9% chance that the Union has won. It just has to, either these people need to find out that their major army has surrendered, or the Union has to go and essentially force all of the rest of the armies to surrender. So you go to April 14, 1865. Lincoln already knows that Robert E. Lee's army has surrendered. He knows that victory is imminent. But you have this gentleman right over here, John Wilkes Booth, who is sympathetic to the Confederate cause."
Social Studies,"And in his mind all is not lost yet. He does see this as a major blow to the Confederate cause, and he thinks that they need to do something desperate if they want to have any chance of being able to come back, being able to maintain their independence from the Union. So he coordinates with a couple of his buddies."
Social Studies,"And he says, hey our only chance is if we assassinate not only Abraham Lincoln, but also Andrew Johnson who's the vice president, and Ulysses S Grant, and we assassinate Seward, who was the Secretary of State. And the idea there is if you assassinate everyone who is in line to become president, then it would just throw the entire Union leadership in disarray, and maybe it would give these characters over here a fighting chance to maintain their independence or maybe come back against the Union Army."
Social Studies,"Unfortunately for John Wilkes Booth, or I guess well you could take it either way, the other three people were not able to fully execute on their plan. Seward was injured. He actually did get stabbed in the face and all that, but he was not assassinated. And John Wilkes Booth was the only person who was able to carry out his assassination. So you have on April 14, 1865 shortly after 10:00 PM Abraham Lincoln is watching a play at Ford's Theater."
Social Studies,"And his booth, the guy who was supposed to guard the booth, was out drinking with his buddies. So I guess the Secret Service really, the security was not back then what it is now, hopefully what it is now. And John Wilkes Booth, who actually used to act at this theater, he picked a time in the play where everyone would laugh and clap. And he said, hey, I'll just shoot right then. People will think it's part of the play or something, or they wouldn't notice as much, and then I'll be able to run out."
Social Studies,"And so he is able to, right in that moment shortly after 10:00 PM, shoot Abraham Lincoln and assassinate him on April 14, 1865. But the whole point here is to just understand that Lincoln did know that Robert E. Lee's army had surrendered at the time of his assassination. So he at least was feeling pretty good about the course of the war.."
Social Studies,"But what I want to do in this video is do a little bit more of a nuanced discussion of capitalism versus, say, socialism. Because I feel like there has been-- especially here, in the United States, and in the West-- a knee jerk reaction against anything that even has a whiff of the government getting involved or even a whiff of socialism. So I want to think more about what are we trying to achieve with the capitalist system."
Social Studies,"And where we could fall into the things we don't want to achieve if some of the aspects of capitalism are allowed to go on without any type of controls or, maybe, some type of regulation. I don't want to advocate anything. I just want to give, maybe, a framework for thinking about it. So you ask any capitalist, including myself, you say, well, what's good about capitalism? And I would say, well, you know it aligns everyone's incentives. So it's good incentives."
Social Studies,"If you work harder, you can earn more, you can generate a capital for yourself. You can use that to improve your standard of living. You can reinvest that capital. So it's a good incentive structure. I'm not saying that everyone is motivated purely by the desire to earn. I think there's plenty of people in the world who are motivated for the desire for social good, for elevating mankind. But the general census in a lot of parts of-- is that those type of things are specific to certain domains."
Social Studies,"But, in other domains, if someone's running a trucking company, it's not clear that someone would run a trucking company optimally just for the good of mankind. Maybe they would run some type of nonprofit that way. But a trucking company, or a farm, or something like that, who knows. So in general, you have a good incentive structure. There's also this notion in a capitalist economy that it's a meritocracy. It is meritocracy."
Social Studies,"And I'm going to, actually, put a box around this because a meritocracy, in my mind, is super duper important. Because even if you talk to us-- almost everyone is a fan of a meritocracy. Even the communists were a fan of a meritocracy. They would give exams to people and have the people who were successful have more authority within the communist regime. So a meritocracy is something that everyone lays claim to."
Social Studies,"And actually a lot of socialists or communists would claim that extreme forms of capitalism, when the wealth disparity becomes two extreme or where you have inherited wealth, actually goes against the idea of meritocracy. So let me actually put meritocracy here as well. And we'll talk about that in a second. And then the other ideas is that you have innovation in capitalism. And these are all related ideas."
Social Studies,"That if the incentives are good, if capital gets in the hands of people who are most deserving of it because they've somehow earned it, they've somehow innovated, that can also lead to innovation because the right people are handling the capital. Now, if we go to the socialist side of things, they'll say, well, look, there's a social cohesiveness to this. So let me write this down."
Social Studies,And I won't speak to the-- I don't claim what I'm going to do in this video is comprehensive of all of the pros and cons of either. I just want to give a little bit of nuance to the discussion. So social cohesiveness. You won't have this situation where you have a gazillionaire sitting behind a walled compound with armed guards and their people right on the other side of that walled compound starving to death.
Social Studies,"And these people don't even, necessarily, view themselves as part of the same society, that they somehow have a responsibility to each other. And that is happening in some parts of the world where you have severe disparities in wealth. The rich people don't even view themselves as the same species as the poor people or even vice versa. You have the other idea of-- and I'll put this in quotes-- fairness."
Social Studies,"And I'll put it in quotes because one could say, well, it's fair if you make more, if you work harder, you should get more. If you innovate more, you should get more. And then their notion of fairness says, well, yeah, but look sometimes this wealth gets so extreme. sometimes you have this notion of inherited wealth. Generation after generation. Old money."
Social Studies,"What's fair about that? That people are just randomly born into a situation where they can just extract the interest off of their wealth and never have to work. And other people have to work super hard and they really get nothing for it. So this notion of fairness, I'll put it over here as well. Fairness. Because there's arguments for either. And so, like I said, I'm definitely biased to the capitalist side of things. I think there is an importance to these things that we have on the right hand side."
Social Studies,"But the reality, at least what we've seen in the economic experiments of the 20th century, is that even though communists and socialists might speak to these types of things, to a large degree there's less social cohesiveness. The senior communists in the Soviet Union would drive fancier cars. And they did have a very different lifestyle then the workers. And they would hide that lifestyle. And then it would lead to a lot of hypocrisy."
Social Studies,"In general, the extreme forms of socialism-- not clear that it was a meritocracy. It might have been just the best people climbing up the party ladder that get to the top as opposed to the people who would innovate and actually produce in a better way. But with that said, I want to give fair warning, that capitalism, if it goes unchecked in certain ways, it could also lead to those same problems of socialism. And the main problems there, when you think about good incentives."
Social Studies,"I think the incentives, and once again, I'm giving my opinion here, the incentives work out well when you have a bunch of competitors who can compete and innovate. And it makes complete sense that, let's say, that this person comes up with an innovation. And because they have that innovation, they're able to provide a better good that's cheaper to society. And so they make more profits. And it seems reasonable that person should get more profits, and more wealth, and grow."
Social Studies,"And it could even be good for society because this person's an innovator. Maybe there was an element of luck there. But it seems like they're competent at managing these resources. So it's good for society to give them more resources to manage. The areas where it becomes less clear that capitalism is unambiguously good, is a situation where this person becomes out right dominate. So let's say that this person becomes so big that none of these other players can even compete with them. So they all disappear."
Social Studies,"This person can just undercut everybody. And all the other players disappear. And this is the situation of a monopoly. And the problem here is, when this guy had competition he had every incentive to work harder. He had every incentive to innovate. It was a meritocracy because the person who innovates well grows the fastest. But once you get to a monopoly stage, and everyone else has died down, this is the only player in the economy, then all of a sudden, he has no incentive to innovate."
Social Studies,"This corporation or this person can just keep raising prices. There's no competition. There's no one else to say, hey, I can have a better product or I can sell it to you cheaper. And so it actually goes against the ideas of innovation. That's why it's really important. And that's why it's part of, especially in the United States, the economic system that you try to break up monopolies. That you don't like monopolistic practices."
Social Studies,"The other risks that you have when you start having a lot of wealth and a lot of influence in one entity, or one person, or one corporation-- and this can happen in a democratic or even a non democratic regime-- is that, the control of resources aren't just control of those resources. Aren't just control of land, and buildings, and railroads. They can also use it to influence government. And in the United States, this has been institutionalized in the form of lobbying."
Social Studies,"And when you have excess resources and you can influence government in this way, you can get the government-- so let's say this is the government over here-- to, essentially, do things for you. So it works to your advantage. And may be allowing you, eventually, to become a monopoly. So you can view this as crony capitalism, where lobbying can be a form of legalized bribery. And in that way, you kind of own the elected officials. I'm not saying that this is happening everywhere but it could happen."
Social Studies,"And in that situation, you have the government acting on behalf of these. And, once again, it goes against the idea of a meritocracy because when you have this cycle developing, maybe this person right over here has the innovation. But this person doesn't have the clout, doesn't have the influence with the government. And so this guy gets the government contract for the planes. Or this guy gets the tax benefits from the government so that he can be even more competitive."
Social Studies,"He can undercut this guy even though this guy has the innovation. The other element-- and I could talk about this for hours. And these are just things to think about-- are the idea of inherited wealth. And I'm not saying that inherited wealth is a bad thing. But there's this idea that, let's say, someone through their competence, maybe competence with a little bit of luck, is able to accrue a huge amount of wealth. And maybe they're not even a monopolist. But they're able to get a huge amount of wealth."
Social Studies,"But they were able to do it-- that they're really good managers. They're kind of these really smart dude. He can he can really manage a lot of resources well. The question arises is, what happens when this person passes away? In a very purely capitalist situation, you pass this onto your children. So you pass this onto your children. And the issue here is, one, what did this person do to earn it? And also from a society's point of view, maybe this person here is a dummy."
Social Studies,"Maybe there was another kid over here who was born at the exact same time, who is way smarter and who-- but this kid is now in control over 100 gazillion dollars. And he can completely mismanage the resources so that they're completely wasted. And so you have this idea of-- over time-- inherited wealth in a capitalist society can go against the ideas of meritocracy. It can go against the idea of good incentives because if this guy inherits enough money, he has no incentive to work."
Social Studies,"Why should he have to study hard and go and tackle math and all that? He's inherited enough money that he gets millions of dollars just off of the interest. Why should he educate himself? He got daddy's or granddad's money. And so it also goes against the idea-- and why should he try to innovate? Why should he ever do anything? He could maybe just hire some of these people and give them a minimum salary, whatever it takes. And so it goes against these ideas of fairness and all that."
Social Studies,"And I'm not saying that I'm against inheritance. I'm just saying this is something to think about. And there's some, probably, threshold of inheritance that it starts to undermine some of these ideas of a meritocracy, and good incentives, and fairness, and all that. And that's why I think it's funny when people who call themselves ""old money"" are proud of it. They view themselves as, somehow, being part of a better caste because ""old money"" means that you did not earn the money yourself."
Social Studies,"That your granddad or you're great grandad earned the money. And you've just happened to be born in this family and are, essentially, just living off of the interest. And it's funny because they'll talk about ""new money"" as if they're not as good as old money. But at least in new money people-- maybe it was through luck, but maybe it was through competence or innovation-- this is something that, at least in my mind, I'd respect more than old. Old money, you've done nothing."
Social Studies,"What's the difference between old money, or a king and a queen, or the aristocracy of Europe, that goes against a lot of the philosophical underpinnings of what the United States is even based on. So I'll leave you there. I just want to add a little bit of a nuance to the conversation. And I will say-- I'll say it again-- I come to this conversation with a capitalist bias. But I'm hoping that this gives you a little bit of more nuance."
Social Studies,"So that instead of saying, capitalism is an unambiguous good and socialism is an unambiguous bad, these are the things that we should try to promote. And to do that, we do have to do some things, like make sure that everyone is educated so that we can have a meritocracy. If everyone is educated, then you have a level playing field. You have this notion of equal opportunity. And that does involve some type of, on some scale, redistribution of-- at least in the form of education."
Social Studies,"Maybe you do need some way for people to get health care. You don't want people dying in the streets. I'm not going to take a stance here, but I'm just showing you that you can't just, even though I do consider myself a capitalist, you can't just say that everything has to be purely capitalist and you can't have any notion of government intervention. You maybe want the government to invest in things like long-term research."
Social Studies,"Where they don't have an immediate profit motive, but 50, 100 years down the future it might allow the society to thrive or whatever else. So I'll leave you there.."
Social Studies,"It becomes a major industrialized nation. And part of that industrializing process, you have some gentlemen who become very, very, very wealthy. You have Cornelius Vanderbilt. His wealth was in the rail and in the steamboats. John D. Rockefeller known by some people as the wealthiest man in history. That may or may not be the case, but he was definitely the wealthiest man in American history. If you inflation-adjust so some accounts will say he had 1.5 billion dollars."
Social Studies,"You might say, ""Wait, I know of people ""who have more than 1.5 billion dollars."" If you inflation-adjust the amount of money that John D. Rockefeller had at the turn of the century it comes out to 400 billion to 600 billion dollars. This is a lot more than anyone that we know of in present times. You have Andrew Carnegie in the steel business. His net worth, if you look at it in a present value basis, is approximately 300 billion. You have people like JP Morgan."
Social Studies,"Although is net worth also huge, huge amount, but where his power was really .... Since he was in control of the financial world at that time, his financial power was tremendous. Maybe more than the type of power that these gentleman could wield. The amount of power that him and his associates controlled through their various holdings, some have said amounted to the amount of wealth in all of the United States West of the Mississippi. These are hugely powerful, hugely wealthy men."
Social Studies,"The type of power and wealth that we actually have not seen since. You can decide what you think of these people. On some level all of these people, I'm sure they were good entrepreneurs. I'm sure they were hard working, I'm sure they innovated in their own way but they were also known for back then that this might be why it would have given fuel to someone like Marx who would look at people like this and say, ""Look, these people have so much power. ""Labor has no power compared to them."
Social Studies,"""Some of the employees in some of these ""companies, it's hard to really say that they are ""independent human beings. ""They're almost like slave labor. ""They live on the campus. They have no rights. ""People are dying while they're working ""for some of these organizations."" So you can decide where you will, but the reality is that these people were hugely, hugely, hugely wealthy, hugely powerful. Now you fast forward to the early 1900s and you start having a little bit of a backlash against these ..."
Social Studies,"I guess the system in which these type of people can thrive. You have Teddy Roosevelt comes to power in 1901. One of the things ... He's famous for many things, but one of the things he's famous for is being a trust buster. When he talks about trust, a trust is really just a large corporation. The idea is, is that, ""Look Standard Oil, ""you have essentially taken control of the ""refining and the oil industry in America. ""You have become a monopolist. ""You need to be broken up."" This is anti-competitive."
Social Studies,"Remember, capitalism for the capitalist sake, for capitalism sake is maybe not that good of an idea. What we want is competition. What we want is innovation. What we want is incentives. If you control everything and no one can compete that's not helping anyone. So Teddy Roosevelt, it didn't happen during his administration but he kind of started the trust busting process, and in the next administration, in Taft's administration, you actually have Standard Oil being broken up."
Social Studies,"Just to get an idea of how big Standard Oil was, if you take Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Conoco, and pretty much every other major US oil company, put them together. I'm not saying it's the equivalent of Standard Oil. That's actually what standard oil was. When Standard Oil was broken up during Taft's administration, it was actually broken up into all of these corporations. You can look into it more. You could imagine how much power someone like that would hold."
Social Studies,"So the pendulum swung in one extreme at the end of the 1800s. Roosevelt comes in, once again Republican President, Very strong President. But he said, ""Look, enough is enough. ""This is too much. ""This is not in the best interest of the American people. ""We need competition."" Then you fast forward even more. In the 20s you have this huge boom. Things are looking well. Whenever there is a boom, people look the other way. People think, ""Oh we don't need much regulation."
Social Studies,"""We don't need much government intervention."" But then booms, many times, almost always lead to busts. Then you have the Great Crash of 29, leads into the Great Depression. People are unhappy with Herbert Hoover. FDR comes into power in kind of the heart of the Great Depression. He stays President until World War 2. In his attempts to take the country out of the Great Depression, he has this New Deal set of programs."
Social Studies,"Some of the New Deal programs were essentially to make use of all the labor and industrial capacity that was going unused during the Great Depression. It was kind of this Keynesian Philosophy that if no one else is going to supply the demand to use all of these factories and use all of these people, the government will. There were these huge public works projects but there was also regulation getting involved here to kind of stop some of the things that were perceived caused the boom and the bust."
Social Studies,"You have the Glass Steagall Act, which is most famous for separating investment banking from depository institutions. Essentially saying the same people who are taking your deposits can't on the other side take your deposits and gamble with them in the stock market. This is when Social Security passed, once again providing a safety net, going slightly in the Socialist direction. Saying, ""Hey look, we can't have, if we're a civilized, rich country, ""we can't have people going hungry in the streets."
Social Studies,"""We can't have older people who have done ""their work, who have contributed to society, ""now all of the sudden that we're in the middle ""of a depression, we can't have them starving to death. ""Or not having them at least having a basic ""level of existence."" You have Social Security. Safety net is coming into play. You have Fannie Mae being created, which the Fannie Mae narrative plays all the way into 2008 and continues to be a part of the story with the American housing situation."
Social Studies,"What this is, is an organization that essentially can buy mortgages. Buying mortgages is it's essentially lending money to people for mortgages. The reason why the government did this, is the government ... This is a separate organization that implicitly had the backing of the government, which says that Fannie Mae can borrow from people but if for whatever reason one day Fannie Mae can't pay back its loans, the government will back it up. It will make good on those loans."
Social Studies,"What that allowed Fannie Mae to do is to borrow money at very low interest rates, essentially close to the rate that the US government could borrow at and then loan that money at very low interest rates to people who want to buy houses. So essentially subsidized home ownership. I should say not home ownership. Subsidized home borrowing. I want to make that clear because if everyone now has more borrowing power to buy a home, then most likely that will just increase the price of houses."
Social Studies,So it's really not subsidizing home borrowing but that's a whole other topic. Once again the government is getting involved. Here they're trying to do a little bit of engineering. Once again this goes against letting the market do its thing. This is a distortion in the market. It's a distortion because once again it's anti-competitive.
Social Studies,If someone else wanted to do what Fannie Mae did but didn't have the backing of the government it wouldn't be able to compete because it wouldn't be able to borrow money as cheaply. You keep fast forwarding. You get to Lyndon Johnson's Administration. Obviously there were other people in between. You get to Lyndon Johnson's administration and you have the Great Society.
Social Studies,"The Great Society, amongst other things, food stamps, war on poverty, Medicare, Medicaid, so once again saying, ""Hey society needs ""to have some base level of support for people."" I'm not going to take sides one way or the other but the pendulum was definitely swinging in the direction of more social safety nets and more attempts to make kind of a level playing field and you can debate whether they were successful or not."
Social Studies,"The other thing, and this is completely unrelated to what this conversation is about but whenever someone learns about Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt in the same video it begs the question, ""Were they related in some way?"" It does turn out they were fifth cousins. Even more interesting, Eleanor Roosevelt, who was Franklin Roosevelt's wife, was Teddy Roosevelt's niece. There actually was a pretty close relationship between all of these Roosevelt's."
Social Studies,"Another interesting thing, I just found this on the Internet, Teddy Roosevelt was also the first President to ride in the open in an automobile. It's funny to see the secret service agents over here riding bicycles to keep up. Anyway, complete tangent. So you had, just to review where we are. End of 1800s you have what some people have called, if they want to be insulting of these people, the robber barrons. They have concentrated a huge amount of wealth."
Social Studies,"Then the pendulum starts swinging back with Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and then Lyndon Johnson. Then you fast forward even through the 70s you still have kind of a fairly heavy regulation of many industries in the US. Jimmy Carter, who was considered quite liberal, you have to give him, if you are anti-regulation, give him some credit. He actually deregulated the airline industry and frankly that's why it's hard ..."
Social Studies,"that's why airline tickets are actually fairly inexpensive if you look at them on an inflation-adjusted basis. Then the pendulum swings back again into less government, less regulation under Ronald Reagan. This is Ronald Reagan here. He is kind of most known amongst other things, I mean, some people think that he brought communism to the brink but he also was big on less government."
Social Studies,"From the story of the 1900s until then was kind of more and more regulation, more safety nets, more government, and then Ronald Reagan comes with less government and lower taxes, although he spent a ton on the military, and the military is government. What's interesting is in this period during the 80s you start having an economic boom. You could debate whether it's due to Ronald Reagan, or maybe it was due to things that were completely out of his control."
Social Studies,"Maybe it was due to automation and information technology starts becoming big and he has nothing to do with that but regardless to say, you do start having an economic boom in the 80s. Then the 90s it starts to accelerate under Bill Clinton. The interesting thing that you see is when things are good the temptation for government to regulate goes down and under Bill Clinton, who is a democratic, considered liberal, you have Welfare Reform, which does undo a lot of ..."
Social Studies,"I guess it takes a more conservative take on welfare. It makes it harder to have welfare for longer periods of time. You also have the repeal of Glass Steagall, so the repeal of Glass Steagall. So even though Bill Clinton was considered liberal, maybe he would blame these things on having a republican congress, who forced him into it, or whatever else. The reality is it did happen under his administration."
Social Studies,"The government stepping out of welfare a little bit and allowing to or kind of a deregulation of banks. Allowing for investment banking and commercial banking to start getting comingled again. Then you keep forwarding through the Bush Administration once George W. Bush, I could put his dad in here in between. Actually he was forced to raise taxes so I can't really include him in the conversation of less government, and he would claim he was forced to do that because of democrats."
Social Studies,"All the way through all of these presidencies, while things were kind of on this upward march, you had this constant stream of deregulation and all the way until you get to 2008. You have a major, major financial crisis. Who knows, now sitting in 2011, where that pendulum will swing back, but there is a sense that maybe all of this went too far and probably the worst signs of this is this whole idea that emerged during the 2008 crisis of Too Big To Fail."
Social Studies,"Which is kind of the worst of Capitalism and Socialism. It's kind of like corporate welfare. It's like, not only are you not giving benefit to those who want to innovate or do well, you have these huge entities that control so much wealth, that control so much of the economy, and they get there by taking huge amounts of risks and as soon as they do incompetent stupid things that put all of us at risk, the government comes in to bail them out because essentially they are holding the economy hostage."
Social Studies,If the government does not bail these characters out they might take the entire economy with them. My sense is that they tried to scare the government a little bit more to have the government believe that so they do get bailed.
Social Studies,"Regardless to say, it does leave kind of a moment in time where society, or at least American society, really the world, has to question how much regulation is appropriate? How much control over the financial system should private institutions be allowed to have? Fannie Mae is an interesting one. Because once again it's a government sponsored institution that was pseudo-private. It was kind of the worst of both worlds. Once again it's still being propped up by the government and it's a major distortion."
Social Studies,"It's a major distortion market but to some degree the government is afraid of letting it completely falter now because it would probably tank the economy to some degree. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting. I just wanted to give you some perspective on the swinging of the pendulum between government regulation and more kind of capitalism without regulation that we've seen in the United States over roughly the last 100 or so years.."
Social Studies,"A democracy does not work unless the people who make up the democracy are willing to be informed, willing to understand what rights they have, and potentially what rights they give up in order to have a better-functioning society. So if we wanna function as a society, you should pay attention to this course. And just so you know what this covers, we start with the foundations of American democracy. How did we get to where we are? You might not appreciate it."
Social Studies,"You might say, ""Oh, democracy goes all the way back to the ancient Greeks."" But the reality is, the modern form of democracy really started with American democracy and then it has been replicated throughout the world. So understand the tensions that the founders faced and how they got to a pretty nice balance that's at least worked for several hundred years. Then we're gonna talk about interactions amongst the branches of government."
Social Studies,"Some of y'all have heard about checks and balances, the executive branch, the judicial branch, the legislative branch. How does all of that work together? Then, civil liberties and civil rights. What are your rights? What are other people's rights? How do we make sure that they are guarded by things like the Bill of Rights? And also more modern versions of what civil liberties and civil rights actually mean. Then, we talk about citizenship."
Social Studies,"You might just think about citizenship as a bunch of privileges you get as a citizen, but there's also some obligations. So think about that a little bit. And then we're gonna talk about ideologies and beliefs, politics, things like political parties, which you're probably familiar with, maybe even tired of hearing about. But it never hurts to be armed with more information. And then, how do you become a better participant in our democracy? The topic of political participation."
Social Studies,"And then we have a bunch of other topics that you'll see that connect to even more modern world topics, things that are relevant in your everyday life. So take a journey with us in US Government and Civics and I...One, you'll learn a lot about the world. You'll be even more popular at dinner parties. But even most importantly, you will know how to participate in our democracy and make us a more perfect union.."
Social Studies,"So let's say that we are in a world without a government. And this is me right over here. And at first, it sounds pretty good. I have unlimited rights here. There's no one infringing on my right. I can say what I want. I have the freest possible speech. There are no laws that I could break. I have the freest possible religion. I have no government telling me what to practice or what I can't practice. I have, I can own what I want. I have property. I can go anywhere, so I have movement."
Social Studies,"And I also have some freedoms that those of us who live in a government don't typically have. So I would have the freedom to tax others or to take from others, take property. If I'm stronger than them, or if I'm just sneakier, I go in the middle night, I can just take their property from them. I could just settle on their land. I could have the freedom to punish others or imprison others if I don't like 'em. It doesn't even have to be for a reason."
Social Studies,"This is a freedom that most of us don't have in the world that we live in today. But without a government, I would have this freedom, this freedom to go and take stuff from others and to do physical harm or imprison them or enslave them. Now, this might sound good to you as an individual, but remember everyone in this government-less society would have these same, would have these same freedoms. And I especially like the ability to have my own property and to have my own freedom of movement."
Social Studies,"But what if this person right over here doesn't like me to have freedom of movement? And so they say they're going to invoke, look, I can punish or imprison you because I don't like you. And so they're going to infringe on my freedom of movement by imprisoning me, or maybe I might do it to someone else."
Social Studies,"And so even though you have all of these freedoms, because everyone else does, especially these latter few, they might be able to take some of these from you, including your freedom to live, your health, your happiness. And this is well-described in political philosophy. In particular, you have a gentleman by the name of Thomas Hobbes, who's considered one of the fathers of political philosophy. And this is what he had to say about this state of nature."
Social Studies,"""As long as men live without a common power ""to keep them all in awe, ""they are in the condition known as war, ""and it is a war of every man against every man. ""In war, the two chief virtues ""are force and fraud."" I can do something by physical force, or I could trick you, or I could sneak around you and take something from you, or imprison you."
Social Studies,"""A further fact about the state of war ""of every man against every man, ""in it there is no such thing as ownership, ""no legal control, no distinction between mine and thine,"" between mine and yours. ""Rather, anything that a man can get is his ""for as long as he can keep it. ""In such a condition, every man has a right to everything, ""even to someone else's body."
Social Studies,"""As long as this continues, therefore, ""that is, as long as every man continues ""to have this natural right to everything, ""no man, however strong or clever he may be, ""can be sure of living out the time ""that nature ordinarily allows men to live."" This was written in Leviathan, which was published in 1651. So he's framing the same thing. If everyone has a right to everything, well, they can infringe on other people, including their life, their health, their happiness, their freedom to movement."
Social Studies,"Now some of you might be skeptical of this. You might say, look, humans are fundamentally good. If you give 'em that freedom, they have a conscience. They're not going to try to do this to other people. But some of you might be able to cite times in society where there's more of an anarchy where actually people might devolve."
Social Studies,"And even if one or two or three, or even if a majority of the people have a conscience and aren't willing to imprison others and punish people arbitrarily, if even a few people are not willing to respect other people's rights, everything might devolve. And it's worth talking about the historical context here because this was near the end of the English Civil War, where there was chaos, where people were asking these questions."
Social Studies,"Well, what type of government should we have? And when there isn't a strong government, all of this chaos is really all about person versus person. It wasn't this degree of chaos that Hobbes is writing about, this kind of natural state without government, but this was a context where there was a lot of bloodshed, a lot of war, and a lot of chaos. Now, Hobbes had a solution, and this is actually why the book was called Leviathan. He was an advocate of a very strong central government."
Social Studies,This keeps people in awe alludes to what he's thinking of. Leviathan comes from the Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible. It's the name of a sea monster. But Hobbes thinks that a government should be a Leviathan to keep everyone in check.
Social Studies,"He wrote, ""When a man thinks that peace and self-defense require it, ""he should be willing, when others are too, ""to lay down his right to everything, ""and should be contented ""with as much liberty against other men ""as he would allow other men against himself."" Now, this idea that he's talking about, this is today referred to as a social contract."
Social Studies,"And this term social contract is first formally used by Rousseau, another Enlightenment author, about a hundred years later, talking about this willingness to give up some rights in order to protect the ones that you really, really, really want to have. And you would be giving up those rights to some form of a government. That is the social contract between the people that are governed and the government that governs them."
Social Studies,"So going back to that previous example where every person was out for themselves, what the social contract is saying is, well, look, certain of these rights, I really want to keep, my freedom of speech, my freedom of property, my freedom to move around, my freedom to have my life, my health, my happiness. In order to protect those freedoms, maybe I'm willing to give some of my other freedoms over to a central authority, as long as everyone is willing to give these up."
Social Studies,"And this central authority that we give it up to is a government. And the government, because it has this, it uses these rights in order to protect the other rights, the ones that I really want to keep. So the government enforces these other rights, and that's the social contract. I give away these rights in order to protect the ones that I really, really care about. And that makes sense, but it still leaves a very, very big question."
Social Studies,"What form should this government take? I'm willing to engage in this social contract, but how does this government govern? How are the leaders selected? What are the constraints on that government? And that will be our focus as we study government and politics.."
Social Studies,"But even though his version is a little bit different than what ends up in the Declaration of Independence, most historians believe that Thomas Jefferson was heavily influenced by John Locke's idea of natural rights when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. And the idea here is that these are rights that people should be born with, that should never be taken away from them. And in the video on social contract, we talk about the idea of why someone would form a government."
Social Studies,"They would form a government, they would give some rights to a government in order to protect these basic rights, things like life, liberty, property, the pursuit of happiness. And so you might have some other rights that one would say in a state of nature people might have, the right to do physical harm on others, the right to imprison others, the right to tax others."
Social Studies,"But in a social contract, we decide, hey, instead of everyone trying to figure out things on their own, let's give these rights to a government and in exchange, the government should protect all of these rights for the individuals. And, once again, this is review from the social contract video. This is a notion of a social contract."
Social Studies,"Now the next question is, all right, so if we are willing to engage in the social contract with a government, what type of a government should it be? And throughout most of human history, governments have been things like monarchies, where you have a single individual, maybe a king or queen, an emperor some type of a conqueror, who is the sovereign, who rules over the state."
Social Studies,"But you could have, you could instead of having one, you could have a small group, which would be an oligarchy, or you could go to the other extreme, where the people are sovereign. And the word for that, and this is a key idea for the United States, is popular, popular sovereignty, the people are sovereign. The government is accountable to the people. Sometimes this could be referred to as democracy."
Social Studies,"Now the Founding Fathers of the United States were a little bit suspicious of pure democracy or direct popular sovereignty. They were afraid that if you start having factions and a majority faction were to come to power, if you have a straight democracy, then they might use that power to strip some of the natural rights of say their political enemies or people that they just don't agree with. And so you have this other idea of limited government. Limited government."
Social Studies,"And some of the key things that limit the government, you could just say generally the rule of law, things like the Constitution, including how the government is structured, the checks and balances in it. The Bill of Rights, clearly is a check on government. And you don't just have limited government when you have a democracy, you could have a limited government even in a monarchy."
Social Studies,"The United Kingdom is officially a constitutional monarchy, where you have a monarch who's sovereign, has very limited powers because of things like the rule of law. Now the last idea, that we're gonna talk about in this video, is the notion of a republic, or the idea of republicanism. Because the Founding Fathers didn't actually like calling the United States a democracy. Instead, they favored calling it a republic."
Social Studies,"And the word republic can mean different things to different people today, depending on what context you use. To some folks, today, it means any form of government that's not a monarchy. To other folks it means, okay, you have a democracy, you have popular sovereignty, but you have limited government. You still have rights that protect minorities, rights that make sure that even if people are not in the majority, they are protected. To the Founding Fathers, they had a version of this notion of republic."
Social Studies,"They did view a republic as something that would prevent the passions of an unfettered pure democracy. But they thought it came mainly by having a representative democracy, that if you had a smaller group of elected representatives, as opposed to everyone getting involved in every issue, that they could calm the passions of the crowds, so to speak. They also thought it was logistically more practical."
Social Studies,"Sure, ancient Athens could have something closer to a pure democracy, but that was just a small city state. Well, here, even the 13 colonies were significantly more vast, and obviously the United States would become even more vast than that. And to appreciate this notion of republic, right over here is a quote from James Madison in The Federalist Papers, Number 10."
Social Studies,"And just for some context on the what The Federalist Papers even were, as we mentioned, shortly after the Declaration of Independence, the Founding Fathers start drafting the Articles of Confederation. They go into effect in 1781. But this is really a loose confederation of states that each, individually, think of themselves as sovereign states. And it's really a pact that they'll engage in war together, diplomacy together, free trade."
Social Studies,"But you have Shays's Rebellion, and it's very clear, and we'll talk about this in other videos, that the Articles of Confederation are not powerful enough. And so you have a constitutional convention in mid 1787, in which James Madison is a central figure. Some people discuss him as the Father of the US Constitution. They draft what is today the Constitution, but then they have to sell it to the states in order for it to be ratified."
Social Studies,"Alexander Hamilton has the idea of, ""Hey, why don't we publish a series of papers?' And they eventually publish 85 papers, which will collectively be known as The Federalist Papers. And Hamilton writes most of them, but he also recruits James Madison and John Jay. And Federalist Papers, Number 10, which is perhaps the most famous, is James Madison's discussion of how do you avoid factions taking over the government and doing things that are not in the interest of the people."
Social Studies,"And I encourage you to read all of Federalist Papers, Number 10. But I have a very small quote here. And this is James Madisons' notion of what a republic was, and he thought the United States should be republic. ""The two great points of difference ""between a democracy and a republic are: ""First, the delegation of government in the latter,"" so he's talking about a republic, ""to a small number of citizens elected by the rest."" So he's really talking about representative democracy."
Social Studies,"But he thought this was a key component of being a republic. ""Secondly, the greater number of citizens ""and greater sphere of country ""over which the latter may be extended."" That only through a representative government could you actually govern over 13 colonies, or even beyond 13 colonies. And that's why, today, obviously you might've had something closer to a pure democracy in ancient Athens, which was a city state."
Social Studies,"But, today, almost any democracy is some form of representative democracy, which James Madison would consider to be a republic. But if you wanted to classify the United States today, a fair term might be it is a democratic republic. You definitely have popular sovereignty, the people are considered sovereign, but they don't rule directly, they rule through representatives, which by Madison's definition would make it a republic."
Social Studies,"So now that you're armed with some of these basic ideas, I encourage you to engage even more with some of the founding documents for the United States. And on top of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution, I encourage you to read as many of the Federalist Papers as possible, because it's really an explanation of the ideas behind the US Constitution. And you should start with Federalist Papers, Number 10. As you'll see, James Madison is quite insightful."
Social Studies,"He predicts how factions might form, how parties might form, and not always do things in the interest of its people. But I'll leave you decide whether he was right, whether forming a republic helps this notion of factionalism. And look at the world that we are in today and think about whether James Madison would be happy, or maybe he would be a little bit uncertain about how things turned out.."
Social Studies,"A little more than a year after the beginning of the war, you have the Second Continental Congress decide to formally declare independence on July 2nd and the Declaration of Independence, which we will study a bit in this video is formally approved on July 4th, which is when we now celebrate Independence Day, even though some could argue that it was July 2nd."
Social Studies,"Now, as soon as the colonies decide that they are independent from the Kingdom of Great Britain, they have to think about how do we govern ourselves? Within roughly a week, a little more than a week after the Declaration of Independence is approved, they start drafting the Articles of Confederation. Remember the Revolutionary War is still going on. Eventually what will be known as the Articles of Confederation go into effect in 1781."
Social Studies,"Now, this Articles of Confederation really treat the various colonies as you could almost view it as separate states that agree to work together for purposes of getting independence from Great Britain, for purposes of fighting the war, for purposes of diplomacy. Now, over the course of the next several years, it becomes clear, especially through things like Shays' Rebellion, which we will look at in other videos that the Articles of Confederation don't provide a strong enough central government."
Social Studies,"In May 1787, you have what is called as a Constitutional Convention convening. It's presided over by George Washington, who led the Americans in the Revolutionary War, which they eventually will win as you see and obviously we're independent country now. The original intent of the Constitutional Convention was to revise the Articles of Confederation, but folks like Madison and Hamilton were really intent on just completely replacing it."
Social Studies,"What they replace it with was what is now the US Constitution, which goes into effect in March of 1789 and shortly thereafter, you have the beginning of Washington's two terms. To be clear, the idea of even having a powerful executive, the idea of even having a president was not present in the Articles of Confederation that comes with the Constitution. With that context out of the way, let's look at, especially the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution."
Social Studies,"Here's the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, written by Jefferson and edited by Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. I encourage you to pause this video and first try to read it on your own and see if you can identify these ideas of natural rights, limited government, popular sovereignty, republicanism and social contract. Let's read this together now. When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds, which have connected them with another ..."
Social Studies,"Remember, this is a Declaration of Independence. They are dissolving the political bonds with the Kingdom of Great Britain and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, so that's starting to refer a little bit to natural rights, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."
Social Studies,"They're saying, ""Hey, we're writing this document because ""we're trying to show the rest of mankind why the reasons ""for which we are deciding to declare ""our independence from Great Britain."" We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, let me underline this, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This is a direct reference to natural rights."
Social Studies,"In fact, the phrase life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, most historians believe is in direct reference to John Locke's phrase life, liberty and property when he talks about natural rights. This is direct reference to the enlightenment ideas or even the pre-enlightenment ideas of natural rights. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."
Social Studies,"This is worth underlining as well because they're talking about governments being instituted among men to secure these rights. This is all about social contract, so that's social contract that we form a government in order to secure rights. We might give it some rights, but in exchange the government has to protect our rights. They derive their powers from the consent of the governed. Let me underline that actually in a different color, derive their powers from the consent of the governed."
Social Studies,"That is popular sovereignty, popular. I'll just write as pop sov, popular sovereignty right over here. That the people are the sovereigns. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. This is more about social contract."
Social Studies,"They're like, ""Look, if a government breaks its social ""contract, we have a right to replace it."" The document also makes reference to organizing its powers in such form, so that's really talking about limited government. They're talking about, ""Hey, this government just won't ""have the absolute right to do anything,"" so that right over there is limited government. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes."
Social Studies,"They're essentially saying, ""Look, you shouldn't just ""overthrow your government on a whim,"" and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed."
Social Studies,"They're saying, ""Look, if you're prudent, you wouldn't just ""overthrow your government on a whim,"" but they're kind of saying, ""We're not so worried about that because history ""has shown us, experience has shown us that if anything, ""people are more likely to keep suffering even when they ""should be overthrowing their government."" But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security."
Social Studies,"They're saying, ""Hey, look, the Kingdom of Great Britain, ""they are abusing us, they are usurping power."" Usurping is taking something from you that is yours and so we need to throw off such a government for our own future security. Here it says, ""Provide new guards for their future security,"" so this provide new guards, once again making reference to limited government. Now, let's fast forward roughly 13 years to the US Constitution, which continues of course to be in effect."
Social Studies,"This over here is a picture of the Constitutional Convention, which we mentioned happened in 1787. The original intent of the Constitutional Convention was to revise the Articles of Confederation, but folks like Alexander Hamilton and James Madison really wanted to replace the Articles of Confederation. You can see it's being presided over by George Washington."
Social Studies,"It starts, the preamble says, ""We the people of the United States, in order to form a more ""perfect Union, establish justice, ""insure domestic tranquility, provide for the ""common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the ""Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ""ordain and establish this constitution for ""the United States of America."" Once again, pause this video and think about whether you see ideas of popular sovereignty, limited government, social contract, natural rights going on even in this preamble or even from the fact that they took the trouble to create this constitution."
Social Studies,"Well, let's start at the beginning. It starts with, ""We the people,"" we the people are the ones that are creating this Constitution and not only does it start with we the people, but we the people is intentionally written in this very, very large writing right over here. This is a picture of the Constitution."
Social Studies,"It's really of all about we the people, the people are sovereign, so this idea of popular sovereignty comes out loud and clear in not just the Declaration of Independence, but also the US Constitution. The fact that we the people are setting up this government, this is all about social contract. They are forming a government. They're forming a social contract with a government that is going to protect, that is going to establish justice, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare."
Social Studies,"Let me make this clear. That is this, this is all social contract. This is what we expect, this government that we're creating to do, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. Now, what about things like limited government? Well, just the very fact that we have a constitution is a sign of limited government that it isn't just a pure democracy that whoever is governing is going to be constrained."
Social Studies,"The rights of the government are going to be described by this constitution. We also talk about the Blessings of Liberty, so this is another reference to natural rights. The Declaration of Independence is a little bit more clear about natural rights or a little bit more explicit, but the Blessings of Liberty does talk about or that's maybe in reference to natural rights. I will leave you there."
Social Studies,"As we study US government, both the Declaration of Independence and even more so, the US Constitution are going to be things that we keep going back to to understand how we are trying to form a more perfect union and what is in line with the vision of our Founding Fathers and what isn't.."
Social Studies,"And it starts, the preamble says: ""We the People of the United States, ""in Order to form a more perfect Union, ""establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, ""provide for the common defense, ""promote the general Welfare, ""and secure the Blessings of Liberty ""to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish ""this Constitution for the United States of America."" Once again, pause this video, and think about whether you see ideas of popular sovereignty, limited government, social contract, natural rights, going on even in this preamble, or even from the fact that they took the trouble to create this Constitution."
Social Studies,"Let's start at the beginning. It starts with ""We the People."" We, the people, are the ones that are creating this Constitution. And not only does it start with ""We the People,"" but ""We the People"" is intentionally written in this very, very large writing right over here. This is a picture of the Constitution. It's really all about ""We the People."" The people are sovereign. This idea of popular sovereignty comes out loud and clear in not just the Declaration of Independence, but also the US Constitution."
Social Studies,"The fact that ""We the People"" are setting up this government, this is all about social contract. They are forming a government. They're forming a social contract with a government that is going to protect, that is going to establish justice, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare. Let me make this clear. That is this, this is all social contract. This is what we expect this government that we're creating to do."
Social Studies,"""Promote the general welfare, ""and secure the Blessings of Liberty ""to ourselves and our Posterity."" Now what about things like limited government? Well, just the very fact that we have a Constitution is a sign of limited government, that it isn't just a pure democracy, that whoever is governing is going to be constrained. There, the rights of the government are going to be described by this constitution. We also talk about the Blessings of Liberty, so this is another reference to natural rights."
Social Studies,"The Declaration of Independence is a little bit more clear about natural rights, or a little bit more explicit, but the Blessings of Liberty does talk about, or that's maybe in reference to, natural rights. I will leave you there."
Social Studies,"As we study US Government, both the Declaration of Independence and even more so the US Constitution are going to be things that we keep going back to to understand how we are trying to form a more perfect Union, and what is in line with the vision of our Founding Fathers, and what isn't?."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] It is very important. The entire theory of popular sovereignty is contained within these beautiful words, so we've got a lot to talk about. - [Sal] And before we even get into it, what do you mean by the theory of popular sovereignty? - [Jeff] So the preamble begins with the famous words, 'We the people of the United States,' and those signal that in the United States, power belongs to 'we the people.' It doesn't belong to our representatives in Congress."
Social Studies,"It doesn't even belong to the state governments. And that was a huge shift because an original draft of the Preamble read, 'We the people of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,' and so forth."
Social Studies,"But, James Wilson, who was the main drafter of the Preamble changed those words, and at some point, the Preamble was changed to the famous words we know now, 'We the people of the United States.' That meant that when some Southern states tried to secede from the Union, before the Civil War, arguing that they were sovereign as state governments, President Lincoln resisted their Constitutional ability to secede, saying that since 'we the people of the United States' had created the Constitution, a majority of 'we the people of the United States' would have to agree before any state could leave it."
Social Studies,"So, that's why it was a huge shift in a conception of power that James Wilson embodied in these words. Before the Preamble, people believed that legislatures were sovereign. In Britain, the king in Parliament was sovereign. But, in America, thanks to Wilson and his brilliant colleagues, 'we the people of the United States' as a whole became sovereign and that came to chart the entire course of Constitutional history."
Social Studies,"But then we have all of these purposes for which the Constitution was formed: to form a more perfect union, establish justice, domestic tranquility, common defense, general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. And then we're saying that's the reason we established the Constitution."
Social Studies,"There's lots to unpack there, but maybe we should focus on those final words: 'secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.' The framers believed that our rights come not from government, but from God or nature, that we're born with them, and when we move from the state of nature into civil society to form a government, we surrender temporary control over certain of those rights in order to secure the safety and security of the rights we've retained."
Social Studies,"So that means that certain rights are unalienable, to use Jefferson's language in the Declaration."
Social Studies,"We can't alienate them to government when we form government, and the purpose of alienating temporary control over certain rights, like allowing the government to punish murder, rather than, you know, having private violence, is to secure the blessings of liberty of the retained natural rights, the first of which the framers believed was complete freedom of conscience, the right to believe or not to believe according to the dictates of our conscience."
Social Studies,"So, we really see that that idea of securing the blessings of liberty is implicit in the idea that our rights come from God and not government, that government only has temporary control of them, and reinforces, once again, that we should never confuse the actions of the government, laws that Congress or the state governments pass, with the will of the people. 'We the people' are sovereign. The government is our servants."
Social Studies,"We are the principles, and when there's a clash between the will of the principles represented by the Constitution and the will of the servants represented by the legislatures, we prefer the principle to the agent. That was what Hamilton said in Federalist 78 in justifying the Supreme Court's power to strike down unconstitutional laws, because the Constitution ratified in the name of 'we the people' represents our views more profoundly than those of ordinary laws."
Social Studies,"That's why judges have to prefer the Constitution to ordinary laws. So, once again, we're seeing packed into this Preamble so much natural law theory and theory of popular sovereignty. There's one other really important notion contained in those words securing the blessings of liberty in the name of 'we the people,' and that's that the Constitution itself didn't get to speak for 'we the people' when it was proposed."
Social Studies,It wasn't until it was ratified by special conventions that had been elected for that purpose that it earned the right to speak in the name of 'we the people' as a whole.
Social Studies,"James Wilson was very keen on the idea that it was the ratifying conventions not the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia that gave the document its status as supreme law and that idea that only laws that go through a special procedure specified in the Constitution in Article V, which is the amendment procedure, or by special Constitutional Conventions, get to speak in the name of 'we the people,' is absolutely core to the whole theory of American Constitutionalism."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Why were the founding fathers so focused on this notion of popular sovereignty, of elected officials being servant to the people, and making it so strongly embedded even here in the Preamble? - [Jeff] They just fought a revolution based on the idea that the tyrannical King George had infringed the natural rights of the people, had refused to grant basic powers of representation, and had broken the social contract, and therefore, had lost the right to govern people because he was governing without consent."
Social Studies,"One of the natural rights that people believed were unalienable, retained by the people, was the right to alter and abolish government whenever it threatens the retained natural rights of the people. That's in the Declaration of Independence and, in the Constitution, it can be found in Article V. So, that right of revolution was part and parcel of the idea that our basic natural rights are retained. And you have to remember how revolutionary it was to be talking of popular sovereignty in 1787."
Social Studies,"There were almost no democratic self-governments on earth then. There had been small-scale democracies in Greek, Greece and Rome. In Athens, Solon, or in Sparta, Lycurgus, had been lawgivers, but no people had ever, as the scholar Akhil Amar says, voted on a written Constitution before, deliberated it, and had it ratified in their name."
Social Studies,"So, that's what was so radical about it, that even the handful of minor of the sort of partial democracies at the time, like the limited suffrage in the British Parliament or the Swiss Cantons hadn't had a written Constitution that was ratified by popular deliberation. So, that's what made it radical and that was Wilson's distinct contribution to America's entire theory of democratic self-governments, and that's why if you had to talk about the essence of Constitutionalism today, it's not populism."
Social Studies,"It's not a quick direct vote. It's not Brexit. It's not a referendum. It's long periods of deliberation, so the text earns the right to speak in the name of 'we the people,' and it was the very reason for which the revolutionaries fought the American Revolution. - [Sal] Fascinating. Let's continue. So, we say that we have 'We the People of the United States,' it establishes the popular sovereignty, and then it says, 'in order to,' and it lists a bunch of reasons why we are, what we are trying to do."
Social Studies,"We already did 'secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.' What are the other things we want to talk about? - [Jeff] Let's go back in order and the first purpose is 'in order to form a more perfect union.' Well, that was the central goal of the Constitutional Convention. The previous union, represented by the Articles of Confederation, had been imperfect. That was sovereign states that were unable to achieve common purposes. They couldn't raise money to support forces in war."
Social Studies,"They couldn't put down rebellions by debtors in Massachusetts, known as Shay's Rebellion. They needed a unanimous vote to achieve anything. And essentially, the government didn't work. So, the framers came to Philadelphia in order to form a more perfect union by establishing a Constitution strong enough to achieve common purposes, but restrained enough to protect, retain natural rights. That's what a perfect union is."
Social Studies,"It's not a consolidated government, because states retained powers under the 10th Amendment. All powers not vested in the United States as a whole are retained by the states or the people. And, ultimately, it's 'we the people' who retain the ultimate power, because we're the ones who are sovereign. But we can parcel that power out either to state governments or to the federal government in order to ensure the protections of liberty."
Social Studies,"So, that's what a more perfect union is and that's why it was so appropriate that Lincoln, in defending the Union during the Civil War, resisted the authority of the state governments to secede on the grounds that 'we the people of the United States' needed to consent before the Union could become less perfect. - [Sal] I just want to double-click on that a little bit because the words, 'more' and 'perfect' don't normally go together. You're either perfect or you're not."
Social Studies,"And so, part of the narrative that I think I'm hearing is that we had the Articles of Confederation, which were imperfect, and we want to get closer to being perfect. That's one of the reasons here. Many reasons when I look at, 'to form a more perfect union,' it also, at least to me, kind of invokes this notion of continuously trying to get better, even from the starting point. - [Jeff] You're right to parse it closely. We're trying continuously to get better, but perfection doesn't mean amalgamation."
Social Studies,"In other words, the most perfect union wouldn't be a total union in which all power is united in the federal government, for example, and not parceled out between the federal government and the states, and also not separated out so the various branches can check each other."
Social Studies,"We want a union perfect enough to achieve common purposes, but not so strong as to threaten liberty, and it was that delicate balance that was crucial to Madison's vision and that led to most of the tensions in the Constitution Convention. - [Sal] And then, 'establish justice?' - [Jeff] Well, my goodness. There's a lot packed into that, and you might think that that mandate to establish justice gives judges the power to do justice, regardless of, let the heaven's fall, to use the expression."
Social Studies,"But that's not what the Supreme Court has held. In a really interesting case, the Supreme Court, it was called Jacobson vs Massachusetts. It came down in 1905. The Supreme Court rejected the claim that the Preamble to the Constitution conferred independent powers that could be enforced by judges. In other words, it wasn't a general mandate that allowed judges to do justice regardless."
Social Studies,"Instead, Justice Harlan said in the Jacobson case, although the Preamble indicates the general purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution, it has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the government of the United States or any of its departments. Such power is embraced only those expressly granted in the body of the Constitution, or, and this is the final bit, and such as may be implied from those so granted."
Social Studies,"So, 'establish justice' is a broad declaration of purposes. Many parts of the Constitution help the government to establish justice, including the Bill of Rights, which requires that people can't be deprived of liberty without due process of law. If they are gonna have a criminal trial, they have all sorts of rights: to confront witnesses, to be tried by jury, and so forth. But, it's the specific articulation of the rights that allow us to establish justice that are the ones the judges can enforce."
Social Studies,"The broad goal is the one set out in the Preamble. - [Sal] And then we have 'insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare?' - Yes, so domestic tranquility is what some says of central concern to the framers. They're concerned about armed mobs like those I mentioned in Massachusetts in Shay's rebellion where debtors and farmers in western Massachusetts are rebelling against their creditors."
Social Studies,"So, they want to allow the government enough power to put down these insurrections, but they don't want a government so strong that it will create standing armies that can be permanent threats to liberty, the kind that King George's army was."
Social Studies,"So, that's why the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution wants to provide for well-regulated militias that can help ensure domestic tranquility, but doesn't want to empower a permanent standing army, because it believes that, ultimately, the people do have to retain the ability to take up arms to defend their own liberty if the government is threatening it as part of their unalienable right to alter and abolish government. So that's the domestic tranquility part."
Social Studies,"And then, the common defense, of course, is hugely important and Congress has the power to declare war. The President is Commander-in-Chief. The President has the power to repel sudden attacks, but otherwise it's supposed to be Congress in theory at least, that authorizes the deployment of troops abroad, and the parts of Article I for Congress and Article II for the President that give those two branches war-making powers, help to ensure that the Constitution provides for the common defense."
Social Studies,"The final clause, I hestitated to introduce because it's so incredibly broad, 'promote the general welfare,' wow. Well, I mean, that could be read as a kind of blank check for the government to do whatever it thinks is necessary to promote the general welfare. But, both the Supreme Court and also the framers, in ratifying the Constitution, made clear that the general welfare clause was not a blank check."
Social Studies,"It was that Congress and the President could only exercise the powers that were either explicitly granted by the Constitution or could be fairly implied by them. And yet, at the same time, Chief Justice John Marshall and others suggested that those powers have to be broadly construed enough to achieve the purposes of the Constitution, which include promoting the general welfare."
Social Studies,"So, you might say that promoting the general welfare is a different expression of the goal of promoting a more perfect union, except you could say that there's a separate goal of passing laws that are in the general welfare, again, without threatening liberty, and that clause, once again, embodies this tectonic balance between empowering government, but also protecting retained rights."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So, just to make sure that we got all of the big points, we've learned that, although the Preamble itself isn't a basis for justice, like the body of the Constitution, it establishes that 'we the people' are the source of political power in the United States. It explains that the Constitution would form a more perfect union between the states and the federal government than the weak Articles of Confederation, while ensuring that the people still retained their natural rights."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Preamble, which I encourage you to do, visit the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. Government and Politics.."
Social Studies,"What flavor of democracy does it take on, especially at different layers of government? So just as a review, and this is something that we have talked about in other videos, democracy comes from Greek from rule by the people. Demo from demos, which is referring to people, and cracy coming from kratia, which is referring to rule. So, rule by the people. Now broadly speaking, we can think of three general flavors of democracy, the first we can consider to be participatory. Participatory democracy."
Social Studies,"The second we can call pluralist democracy, and I'll define these in a second. And then the third, let's call that elite democracy. Elite democracy. Now, what do you think participatory democracy means, based on the word participatory? Yes, as you might have guessed it implies broad participation of the population. Broad participation."
Social Studies,"What are examples of a participatory democracy? Well, imagine a small town that has maybe a few hundred or a few thousand people and if there's an issue of whether to build a stop light at an intersection or a change in some of the zoning laws, you can imagine a large chunk of the town showing up to weigh in on that decision."
Social Studies,"Now, what are some of the benefits of a participatory democracy and what are some of the negatives? Well, the benefits are, and I'll do those as pluses, a benefit is, well, it kind of seems closest to the original spirit of a democracy. It's coming out of ancient Greece, ancient Athens, the birthplace of democracy where you did have residents go together and debate the major issues."
Social Studies,"Although even in ancient Athens you have to take participation with a grain of salt because it wasn't everyone who was participating. It was, for the most part, wealthy men who had the time to actually sit and debate these issues. But, if we want to give a participatory democracy its credit say in a small town, is that you really are representing the views of the people. Representing the people well. The people are directly involved."
Social Studies,"Now, what are maybe some of the negatives? Well, it can get logistically difficult."
Social Studies,"We talked about a small town, but what if the town gets a little bit bigger? Or what we're dealing with a state? Or we're dealing with a country where we're talking about tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions or tens of millions of people? How do you get all of those people to weigh in on an issue, even logistically? How do they get informed about it, and are they even prepared to weigh in on those issues? Sure, if you're in a town you can think about whether an intersection should be there or whether they should put a stop light there, but if we're talking about matters of national or international importance influencing hundreds of millions of people, can you depend on people to be informed about the intricacies of the banking system or the military or foreign policy? And so this is really a question of, does this scale? And there really aren't any good examples in history of direct democracy scaling in significant ways beyond fairly small groups of people."
Social Studies,"In the United States the biggest scale where you might see this are in things like ballot measures at the city or the state level where people are directly voting on certain measures or certain laws. But even there, it's a limited scope for what the people will actually weigh in on. Now, the next category that we talk about is a pluralist democracy. Pluralism is referring to the idea of many different parties. Same root as the word plural, you have many things."
Social Studies,"So you have many different parties and many different competing interests that are going to have a vigorous debate with each other on deciding what are the best ideas. And what are examples of pluralist democracies? If you think about the United States, there are many different interest groups."
Social Studies,"You can think about all of the different lobbyists, all of the different groups that represent different types of people trying to convince members of Congress, either at the national level, or even at the state level that their interest is right. Even within Congress, even though you have two major parties you can have different factions that are really trying to argue it out."
Social Studies,"Now, what are the benefits of a pluralist democracy? Well, you can imagine that because there is this vigorous debate, maybe the good ideas surface. Good ideas surface. You don't have domination by just one party. No one group or a small group of people domination. But then, on the other side of it, maybe they're some negatives, what might those be? Well, maybe all of this debate and argument is very inefficient, maybe it's slow decision making. Slow decisions, or at an extreme, no decisions."
Social Studies,"Some things like gridlock because people can't agree to things, that in order for anything to get done, you have to make too many people happy and they all have their interests. Maybe the opposite of good ideas surface. Maybe good ideas die because it's very hard to make everyone happy. Now, the last category that we're gonna talk about is the idea of an elite democracy, and this is where you have more limited participation. So in some ways it's almost the opposite of a participatory democracy."
Social Studies,"So this is limited, limited participation. And even though I gave ancient Athens as an example of a participatory democracy, it really was more of an elite democracy where the people had the time and the influence and the money, those were the ones who were really weighing in on the issues of ancient Athens. And if you were to go to the Roman republic, the Roman senators, these were, once again, elite men."
Social Studies,"So what would you think are benefits of an elite democracy? Well, one might be that these elites, so to speak, maybe they are more educated than the general public and so that allows them to make more informed decisions, especially on things that are quite complex that would be hard for everyone to weigh in on."
Social Studies,"If you're going to change a new accounting standard, or think about how do you regulate the telecommunications industry or some very sophisticated trade negotiation or foreign policy negotiation, that education might help. And maybe it's also more decisive than either one of the pluralist or the participatory."
Social Studies,"The participatory they might be able to appeal to maybe baser instincts, just, you know, people's passions while the pluralists, since you have all of these groups competing even if something makes sense they might not be able to make that decision, but if you have a smaller, more limited group, limited participation, maybe they can make these decisions a little bit clearer, but what are the negatives here? Well, the clearest negative is, well, maybe this goes against the whole idea of a democracy."
Social Studies,"If it's all about the elites, maybe they do a good job at truly representing the interests of the people, but maybe they are good at representing the interests of the elite. So do they really represent the people? Is this a democracy where the people are sovereign, where the people rule, or is this an oligarchy where only a few people rule and they rule in their own interests? And so after watching this video, look at the world around you."
Social Studies,"Think about, in the United States, or whatever country you're watching from, what elements of a participatory democracy do you see? What elements of a pluralist democracy, and what elements of an elite democracy do you see? And as we'll see in other videos, these dimensions of democracy were vigorously debated by the Founding Fathers when they thought about whether to ratify the Constitution."
Social Studies,"We'll see this debate when we look at the Anti-Federalist Papers, especially we'll look closely at Brutus number one. We'll see this debate when we look at the Federalist Papers, especially Federalist number 10, written by James Madison and I'll let you decide, when we look at that, who was right and what flavors of democracy are most dominant in the United States at different levels.."
Social Studies,"It really was a mutual defense union with a little bit of free trade, as well see in the text here. This is some of the beginning passages of the Articles of Confederation, and I encourage you to read the whole thing, it's actually quite interesting. But you immediately see it has a very different tone than the one that we see in the US Constitution."
Social Studies,"The Constitution starts with ""we the people,"" while the Articles of Confederation starts with ""to all to whom these Presents shall come,"" so it's almost, you know, kind of an awkward business letter. ""We the undersigned Delegates of the States ""affixed to our Names send greeting."
Social Studies,"""Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union ""between the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts-bay, ""Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, ""Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, ""Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, ""South Carolina and Georgia. ""The Stile of this Confederacy shall be ""'The United States of America.'"" This part is interesting. ""Each state retains its sovereignty,"" so it rules over itself, it's not giving up its sovereignty to some type of a union."
Social Studies,"So it ""retains its sovereignty, its freedom, ""and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, ""which is not by this Confederation ""expressly delegated to the United States, ""in Congress assembled."" So they're really viewing themselves as independent countries that are next to each other that for the sake of fighting the Revolutionary War, agree to things like mutual defense and free trade, but they are really separate countries."
Social Studies,"""The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league ""of friendship with each other, for their common defense,"" so this is that mutual defense idea, ""the security of their liberties, ""and their mutual and general welfare, ""binding themselves to assist each other ""against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, ""or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, ""or any other pretense whatever."" And then it says, ""the better to secure and perpetuate ""mutual friendship and intercourse among the people ""of the different States in this Union, ""the free inhabitants of each of these States..."
Social Studies,"""shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities ""of free citizens in the several States; ""and the people of each State shall free ingress and regess ""to and from any other State, and shall enjoy therein ""all the privileges of trade and commerce."" So people could travel back and forth between these states, there would be free trade, but these would be viewed as different countries."
Social Studies,"One interesting thing that you don't hear people talk a lot about, there is even a little passage here that allows Canada to join this confederation."
Social Studies,"""Canada, acceding to this confederation, ""and adjoining in the measures of the United States, ""shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advanatages ""of this Union; but no other colony shall be admitted ""into the same, unless such admission ""be agreed to by nine States."" So they're saying hey, if Canada agrees, they are pre-agreeing to allow Canada to join this union, which Canada obviously does not join. But it's interesting to think that they thought about this."
Social Studies,"Now what are the weaknesses here? Well the most obvious one, I don't have the entire Articles of Confederation here, but how does this United States of America wield its power? Where does its money come from? It turns out that if it needs to generate revenue in order to take some action, it can't tax the citizens of the states, the states can only do that themselves. Instead it has to apply to the states in order to contribute to the United States of America."
Social Studies,"If you want to take some type of unified action, well you would have to have delegates from the various states, and meet together and decide what to do. You wouldn't have any strong leader being able to take decisive action. And so there really wasn't a notion of a central government here. There wasn't even a notion of one country, one nation. It really was about different sovereign states. And all of this, as we'll see, will come to a head in the mid-1780s."
Social Studies,"The United States has a significant amount of debt exiting the American Revolutionary War. Debt to countries like France. You also have debt on the individual level. Merchants owe money to European merchants and traders and lenders, and these lenders weren't interested in paper currency from these newly created states. They wanted hard currency, they wanted gold and they want silver."
Social Studies,"And so many of the merchants in the United States in turn put pressure on the people they lend money to, especially poor farmers, many of whom had been veterans in the Revolutionary War, to pay their debts in hard currency. And so you can imagine these poor farmers who were kind of the bottom of this food chain were in a pretty tough bind."
Social Studies,"They had fought in the Revolutionary War, they had risked their lives, many of them had been injured, but they actually did not get paid for their service, to a large degree. And then now, they were not able to even survive as farmers, because not only were they not able to borrow new funds, but some of their existing funds they had to pay back in hard currency, which wasn't available in the United States. And so all of this tension eventually comes to a head in western Massachusetts."
Social Studies,"This right here is a picture of Daniel Shays, who was one of these poor farmers in western Massachusetts who was also a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who was not paid for his service. And so he eventually becomes one of the leaders of these rebellious former veterans, poor farmers, and they start taking the courthouses of western Massachusetts, making them inoperable. These were the courthouses where people had to report to in order to talk about how they would repay their debt."
Social Studies,"Well you can imagine this worried many of the merchants who these people owed their debt to. It also worried many of the founding fathers, because it took some time for the government of Massachusetts to be able to react to this, and while that was happening, through mid-1786 into the beginning of 1787, this rebellion got stronger and stronger and stronger."
Social Studies,"Eventually, on January 25th, 1787, we see things coming to a head where Daniel Shays is leading his rebels to take the armory in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is in western Massachusetts, but stopped by militia. This is a militia that's paid for by merchants in the area, who probably want their debt paid, or just wanted functioning courthouses, or did not want all of these rioting farmers and former veterans."
Social Studies,"And so this rebellion is put down, but it shows the weakness inherent in the Articles of Confederation. This rebellion starts having the potential to spread well beyond Massachusetts. But there was not a coordinated action. In fact, it took many months to even be able to field a militia against the rebellion. It also highlighted the weakness of not having one central government that could take decisive action."
Social Studies,"Also one central government that could generate its own revenue through taxing the citizens of all of the states and using that for things like a military, or being able to negotiate debts with foreign countries. And so Shays' Rebellion is cited by many historians as one of the main catalysts, after it was put down, for having the Constitutional Convention in mid-1787 to rethink the Articles of Confederation."
Social Studies,"Now as we talked about in other videos, many people went to this convention thinking we're not just gonna edit the Articles of Confederation, we need to create a stronger central government. We need a federalist system where yes, the states can have rights, but we also need a central government. We need a strong leader at the head of that central government."
Social Studies,"And so they do draft what is now the Constitution at this convention, and after the convention, they sell this new constitution, because remember, it has to be ratified by the states through the Federalist Papers, which we also talk about in other videos, Hamilton organized it, but James Madison and John Jay also significant contributors, and eventually, the Articles of Confederation does get replaced, the Constitution is ratified, and it becomes effective on March 4th, 1789.."
Social Studies,"What were the Articles of Confederation, and why did they need to get replaced? - Well, the Articles of Confederation were the first loose set of rules to govern these 13 states, but they were a mess. Essentially, they allowed the states to be kind of their own little sovereign islands. So, it was not a united nation. It was like an Archipelago of islands. And, the reason they were a mess. There's a couple of things."
Social Studies,"when they tried to repay the Revolutionary War soldiers, Congress and Washington with very little power, had to go to the states and say, please give us some money so we can repay the soldiers. A lot of the states said, no thank you. We're not going to do that."
Social Studies,"Then if you had a river that rolled through several different states, and you wanted to have a trade agreement with the Spanish, for example, to use that river and trade along it, then the government didn't have one way to negotiate with the Spanish. Individual states had to do it, and individual states had different interests. Some wanted to trade with the Spanish. Some didn't want to trade at all. And so, how do you get those states to agree on something? There was also not universal coinage."
Social Studies,"The states all made their own money and differently. Well, states might print a bunch of money in order to payoff some debts, and then the money in one state is worth less than the money in another, who regulates all of that? So, commerce, and industry, and self-defense. There was no way to raise an army an pay for it. So, the nation was crumbling before they got to Philadelphia in 1787."
Social Studies,"- And to your point, in most countries the parts of the country are called things like provinces, but ours are states, because they view themselves as individual countries. - Absolutely, and because of course, the Articles of Confederation had been formed in the wake of this fear, and the experience of the fear of a monarchy."
Social Studies,"So, they wanted personal liberty, and get the monarchy and national control, throw it all away, because they believe that once you consolidate control, in a national government of any kind, that it would trample liberty. And so, after having fought a revolution for the purposes of liberating the people, you're not gonna design a government that then stomps down on that liberty."
Social Studies,"So, they created something that gave the states lots of flexibility, and then that flexibility allowed everybody to go off in their different directions. - So, Articles of Confederation, maybe too much independence for the individual states. So, it seems like there was a consensus to fix it. What was the central debate when they decided to fix it? - Well, there was a consensus it had to be fixed, but when they got to Philadelphia."
Social Studies,"First of all, Rhode Island was invited and said no thank you, so 12 of the 13 states showed up. And, they knew they wanted to centralize things. But, what did that mean? And, did it mean one president, or a council of presidents? Did it mean a strong Congress? How strong? Could they tell states what to do? Well, if they did that then they were acting just like George III had acted."
Social Studies,"So, they had to iron out all of these issues to bring enough central control, and enough quick movement of government, that it could address national problems, but not so much that it trampled and stomped on that liberty. And, that was the constant debate. Constantly trying to figure out how to keep the balance between giving enough national power, but enough liberty. And that, some of the biggest fights included fights over slavery, North versus South, fights over big states versus small states."
Social Studies,"Who has representation in this national government, and how do you figure that out? And then of course, the question of do we want a president? Will it be a single person, and how the dickens do we elect that person? Which led us to the Electoral College, which has had some bumpy history. - And, where do you think we ended up? If on a scale of zero to 10. If was zero was a complete, you know, independent states, and 10 is a federal government that just controls everything."
Social Studies,"Where do you think the US Constitution ended up relative to the Articles of Confederation? - Well, in September of 1787, when it gets September 17th, 1787. When the new Constitution gets voted on, it is a stronger national document that has basically three main parts. One, the people are at the heart and center of it. It is the people who are the representatives, or at the center of the republican government. The second thing is that the national government can tell states what to do in some instances."
Social Studies,"Those instances are circumscribed, but it can happen. The states have to fall in line. That was very new, and there is this thing called a presidency which is created. Single person, created really in the mold of George Washington."
Social Studies,"So, it is a nationalized government, but with a strong attention to this question of protecting liberty through a balance of power system, so that both the national government has checks and balances, and also the relationship between the federal government and the state government has a number of checks and balances."
Social Studies,"So, even though they went in a more centralized direction, they were constantly attentive to this idea of liberty, keeping it free in the states, and not messing with them too much in their effort to get some kind of centralized control. - So, it sounds like they might have gone from a one or a two with the Articles of Confederation, to maybe a seven? - Well, they went, I think they went from a one or two to maybe a five or a six, which has now moved. - Over time."
Social Studies,"- Over time, closer to maybe an eight or nine. - Fascinating.."
Social Studies,"In this video we're gonna focus on the other side, on the folks who are aggressively advocating for ratification of the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay were some of the most prominent of these and they were the ones that wrote the Federalist Papers that were focused on convincing everyone to adopt the Constitution. And what we're going to look at in this video is, perhaps, the most famous of the Federalist Papers, this is Federalist number 10."
Social Studies,"Or at least an excerpt of Federalist number 10 that we're going to look at right over here. It was published November 23, 1787. And if you remember the video on Brutus I this is only a few weeks after Brutus I, which is now considered a famous anti-Federalist Paper was published. So it's right in this time period right over here where people are going back and forth deciding, do we ratify this constitution? And James Madison published under the pen name Publius."
Social Studies,And Publius is making reference to one of the ancient Roman aristocrats who overthrew the Roman kingdom in the late sixth century to establish the Roman Republic. So one way to think about it is he is viewing himself and the other Federalists as trying to establish a strong republic.
Social Studies,"This is in comparison to Brutus, which we see as the pen name for some of the significant anti-Federalist Papers, and Brutus played a significant role in the assassination of Julius Caesar to keep him from corrupting the republic, ending the republic and turning it into an empire. But now let's read this excerpt of Federalist number 10. And as I read this keep in mind some of these ideas, these flavors of democracy that we have talked about in other videos."
Social Studies,"Does Madison, in Federalist number 10, does he seem pro-participatory democracy or anti-participatory democracy? Does he seem to think that pluralism is a good idea or a bad idea? And is he more pro elite democracy or anti-elites running a democracy? ""To the People of the state of New York."" Like Brutus I, it's addressed to the people of the state of New York because one, New York was a significant state and he's trying to convince them, in this case, to support the US Constitution."
Social Studies,"""Among the numerous advantages promised by a well ""constructed union, none deserves to be more accurately ""developed than it's tendency to break and control the ""violence of factions."" So a well constructed union needs to be able to control the violence of a faction. In fact, this is the in the title, The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection."
Social Studies,"""Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate ""and virtuous citizens that our governments are ""too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in ""the conflicts of rival parties, ""and that measures are too often decided not according ""to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor ""party, but by the superior force of an interested and ""overbearing majority."" So already outlining some of the problems."
Social Studies,"This problem of faction, this problem of majority rule overrunning minorities or the rights of the minorities. ""It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will ""be able to adjust these clashing interests,"" the clashing interests of faction, ""And render them all subservient to the public good."
Social Studies,"""Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm, ""it may be concluded that a pure democracy, ""by which I mean a society consisting of a small number ""of citizens who assemble and administer the government ""in person can admit of no cure for the mischiefs ""of faction."" So a pure democracy, which is about as close as you can get to a participatory democracy, Madison here is claiming that it can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of the faction, that it doesn't really help the situation."
Social Studies,"""A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, ""be felt by a majority of the whole, ""and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice ""the weaker party or an obnoxious individual."
Social Studies,"""Hence it is that such democracies have ever been ""spectacles of turbulence and contention; ""have ever been found incompatible with personal security ""or the rights of people; and have in general been as short ""in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths."" So what does Madison think of participatory democracies? Right, he doesn't think too highly of them."
Social Studies,"He says, ""Look, a majority is going to take over ""and they're going to trample over the rights of ""everyone else."" So clearly he thinks that a participatory democracy, not good. ""A republic, by which I mean a government in which the ""scheme of representation takes place, ""opens a different prospect, and promises the cure ""for which we are seeking."" So in his definition of republic it's a situation where you have the people being represented by others."
Social Studies,"""The two great points of difference between a democracy, ""or pure democracy, and a republic are first the ""delegation of the government in the latter to a small ""number of citizens elected by the rest."" So he's saying in a republic you're delegating the government to a small number of citizens elected by the rest."
Social Studies,"""Secondly, the greater number of citizens and the greater ""sphere of country over which the latter,"" the republic, ""may be extended."" So this is interesting because in Brutus I the argument is made that republics aren't good at ruling over large territories. Here Madison is claiming that a republic is better at ruling over a greater sphere of country, over a greater number of citizens."
Social Studies,"""The effect of the first difference,"" and so this is a notion of having those representatives, having a representative democracy, ""Is to refine and enlarge the public views, ""by passing them through the medium of a chosen body ""of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true ""interest of their country and whose patriotism and ""love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it ""to temporary or partial considerations."
Social Studies,"""Under such a regulation it may well happen that the ""public voice, pronounced by the representatives of ""the people, will be more consonant to the public good ""than if pronounced by the people themselves."" So this is really, really interesting because we already saw that Madison's not a fan of participatory democracy and here he's saying, ""Look, if you take the views and ""pass them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens ""that these people might represent the public good ""better than the people themselves."" This is really Madison being very pro elite democracy."
Social Studies,"Where you have a limited number of people who are really participating and he's making the argument that they might be better at representing the needs of the people than the people themselves. ""On the other hand, the effect may be inverted."" So he is giving some credence to the other side of the argument. ""Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, ""or of sinister designs may, by intrigue, by corruption, ""or by other means first obtain the suffrages and then ""betray the interests of the people."
Social Studies,"""The question resulting is whether small or extensive ""republics are more favorable to the election of proper ""guardians of the public weal; ""and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter,"" so large republics, ""by two obvious considerations."
Social Studies,"""In the first place, however small the republic may be, ""the representatives must be raised to a certain number, ""in order to guard against the cabals of a few, ""and that however large it may be, they must be limited ""to a certain number in order to guard against the ""confusion of a multitude."" So this is really interesting, he says, ""Look, no matter how large your republic you're going ""to need a certain number of representatives."
Social Studies,"""You have too small then they're just going to be able ""to control everything, but if you have too many ""representatives it's just going to be confusing."" ""Hence, the number of representatives in the two cases ""not being in proportion to that of the two constituents,"" you're not gonna keep the same proportion depending on population, ""and being proportionally greater in the ""small republic, it follow that, if the proportion of ""fit characters be not less in the large than in the ""small republic, the former will present a greater option ""and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice."" So what he's really saying is in a large republic you're more likely to find fit and good representatives than you will in a smaller republic."
Social Studies,"Once again, he wants people who he considers to be elite in some way. The more educated, whatever you might consider elite to be. For the sake of time I'll leave you there in this part one video and in part two we'll see James Madison continue to argue, not only for a republic, but for a large republic which the US Constitution provides for."
Social Studies,"Arguing that you'll have better people representing in government and you will also have a more pluralist society, which we'll see is very different than the view of the anti-Federalists.."
Social Studies,"In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large, the large republic, than in the small republic. It will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious art by which elections are too often carried and the suffrages of the people be more free will be more likely to center in men who possess the most attractive merit. Once again, elite democracy, and the most diffusive and established characters."
Social Studies,"Once again, elite democracy. So here, he is making the argument that not only in a large republic will you have a better choice of candidates, but because the candidates have to appeal each to a large number of people, that they are less likely to come to power through shady dealings and you're mostly likely to get the best folks. It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a mean on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie."
Social Studies,"So you say hey look, there is, as in all things, there is kind of a moderate middle ground. By enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the representatives to little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests, as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to these and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in this respect."
Social Studies,"The great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the state legislatures. So what he's saying is that the Constitution offers this really nice balance here. You can have the people participating at the national level who are interested in the great and aggregate interests and it's okay if those folks aren't completely attached to what is happening at home, the local interests."
Social Studies,"In fact, he'd probably prefer that they're not attached too much to the local interests, but the local interests could be focused at the state legislatures, which the Constitution provides for. The other point of difference, so once again, he is referring to the difference between a republican government and a pure democracy. The greater number of citizens in the extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government."
Social Studies,"So it's that point that he believes the republican government can better govern a large population than a pure democracy and it is this circumstance principally which renders the factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter. So he's saying because a republican model can govern over more people, it better addresses this issue of factious combinations. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it."
Social Studies,"The fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party, and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests. You make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens."
Social Studies,"What Madison is saying here is if you have too small of a society, you're not going to have enough pluralism, you're not going to have enough points of view, that it will be easy because people will be very aligned for a majority to take over and infringe on the rights of a minority. So he is very pro pluralism here."
Social Studies,"He wants to see a large society with many different views because he says if you have a large society with many different views, with many different parties, so to speak, well then it's less likely that one party can just take over and infringe on the rights of other people. This is the exact opposite of what Brutus one argues for. Brutus one argues that pluralism is a bad thing, that people are just going to be bickering the whole time and decisions aren't going to be made."
Social Studies,"Brutus one argues that in a republic, people should be of roughly the same opinion, to have roughly the same interests while here in Federalist number 10, Madison is arguing that no, pluralism is a good thing, it is a check on an overbearing faction, it is a check on majority rule. Hence, it clearly appears that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy in controlling the effects of faction is enjoyed by a large over a small republic, is enjoyed by the Union over the states composing it."
Social Studies,"So the big picture of Federalist number 10 is how do you control faction? And faction is really about how do you control a majority faction that's trying to control everyone else and trying to oppress everyone else. Madison makes the argument that one, through a republican system, you're more like to do this, by having a representative government."
Social Studies,"And then if you have that, you want to make it larger rather than smaller so that you have a pluralist society, so you have many points of view and you don't have one group being able to dominate. And in order to have that larger society, the Union is more favorable over having 13 independent, sovereign states."
Social Studies,"In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government and according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in being republicans ought to be our zeal and cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of Federalists.."
Social Studies,"You have events like Shays' Rebellion which really highlights this and then as we go into 1787 you have a Constitutional Convention, at first to maybe revise the Articles of Confederation but eventually they draft a completely new constitution, the constitution that we have today and after it was drafted, after that convention, we get into his period of late 1787 and 1788 where you have this very vigorous debate between those who want to ratify the constitution often known as the Federalists led by folks like Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay, famous for writing the Federalist Papers which they published in this timeframe and you also have the anti-Federalists or who will eventually be known as the anti-Federalists who are against the ratification and the adoption of the constitution and their writings which are also published in this same time period are known as now the anti-Federalist Papers and what I have here is an excerpt from what is perhaps the most famous of the anti-Federalist Papers, this is from Brutus I, published on the 18th of October 1787, so right in this time period right over here, right after the Constitutional Convention had ended and the states were deciding whether to ratify it."
Social Studies,"And Brutus is the pen name of the author. It's believed to be either Robert Yates, Melancton Smith or John Williams from New York but the reason why they picked the name Brutus is from history. Brutus is the Roman senator who was involved in assassinating Julius Caesar keeping him from overthrowing the Republic, so in some ways they view themselves as people who are protecting the Republic from tyranny."
Social Studies,"Now, as I read this, keep in mind some of the ideas that we've looked at in other videos, the different types of democracy, a participatory democracy where the citizens are close to the governance, to the decision making. You have a pluralist democracy where you have a vigorous debate between many, many different views."
Social Studies,"And you have an idea of an elite democracy where the people are still sovereign but they're being represented by a smaller, limited group of I guess you could say elite, maybe more wealthy, more educated folks who are trying or should be acting in the interests of the citizens. So, keep those in mind and think about what type of democracy the author here favors and what they might be afraid of. And so, Brutus wrote, to the Citizens of the State of New York."
Social Studies,"The first question that presents itself on the subject is whether the 13 United States should be reduced to one great republic, governed by one legislature and under the direction of one executive and judicial or whether they should continue 13 confederated republics under the direction and control of a supreme federal head for certain defined national purposes only? So, they're starting with this argument that his new constitution is really creating just one supreme government instead of a confederation of sovereign republics that coordinate for certain, defined national purposes."
Social Studies,"It goes on to write, this government is to possess absolute and uncontrollable power, legislative, executive and judicial with respect to every object to which it extends. The powers of the general legislature, so they're talking about what will eventually be the US Congress as proposed by the constitution extend to every case that is of the least importance, there is nothing valuable to human nature, nothing dear to freemen, but what is within its power."
Social Studies,"It has the authority to make laws which will affect the lives, the liberty, and property of every man in the United States, nor can the constitution or laws of any state in any way prevent or impede the full and complete execution of every power given. So, once again, saying hey, this is a takeover, these 13 states are really becoming one state under the constitution."
Social Studies,"This central government has so much power that it kind of makes the states a little bit irrelevant because they can't do something outside of what the central government thinks they should so, so then having established this argument and once again, this is just an excerpt, I encourage you to read all of Brutus I, it's quite fascinating, the author then argues why this is a bad idea to have this takeover and have 13 sovereign states turned into essentially one."
Social Studies,"Let us now proceed to inquire as I at first proposed whether it be best the 13 United States should be reduced to one great republic or not. History furnishes no example of a free republic, anything like the extent of the United States. The Grecian republics were of small extent, so also was that of the Romans."
Social Studies,"Both of these, it is true, in process of time extended their conquests over large territories of country and the consequence was that their governments were changed from that of free governments to those of the most tyrannical that ever existed in the world. So, he's saying hey, look, there's really no precedent for this."
Social Studies,"When you just had the Athenians governing themselves in a participatory model, yes, a republic seemed to work but then, once it started to extend its influence over surrounding cities, surrounding regions, it became more tyrannical and the Romans even more so. The territory of the United States is a vast extent. It now contains near three millions of souls and is capable of containing much more than 10 times that number."
Social Studies,"These might not seem like big numbers now, the United States is today over 100 times bigger but this was already quite a bit larger than say just ancient Athens. Is it practicable for a country, so large and so numerous as they will soon become to elect a representation that will speak their sentiments without their becoming so numerous as to be incapable of transacting public business? It certainly is not. So, this is really interesting."
Social Studies,"So, to the founding fathers, the idea of a republic was really a representative democracy and Brutus here is questioning, look, if you're governing over such a vast territory, can you have a representation that will truly speak the sentiments of the people and if you do have true representation of the people, well, are you going to have so many representatives and so many interests that they're not going to be able to govern? So, he's saying hey, this is gonna pluralist and he does not view pluralism as a good thing."
Social Studies,"He's saying hey, there's going to be so many views. This is going to be ungovernable. In a republic, the manners, sentiments and interests of the people should be similar. So, this is worth underlining again 'cause this is a statement directly against the notion of pluralism. He says that in order for a republic to work, you have to have people of similar sentiments and interests, not different views."
Social Studies,"If this be not the cases, there will be a constant clashing of opinions and the representatives of one part will be continually striving against those of the other. So, clearly did not think much of a pluralist democracy. This will retard the operations of government and prevent such conclusions as will promote the public good. So, he sees pluralism as a recipe for indecision and not being able to pass good laws or do things in the public interest."
Social Studies,"He goes on to say, in so extensive a republic, the great officers of government would soon become above the control of the people and abuse their power to the purpose of aggrandizing themselves and oppressing them. So, here it looks like like the author is afraid of, you could kind of say, an elite democracy, that it really wouldn't even be a republic, that these people are going to start acting in their own interests."
Social Studies,"If you have to have representatives that represent such a large territory, they're going to be detached from the people that they're representing and then are just going to think about their own aggrandization and they will actually oppress the people that they're supposed to represent. These are some of the reasons by which it appears that a free republic cannot long subsist over a country of the great extent of these states."
Social Studies,"If then this new constitution is calculated to consolidate the 13 states into one, as it evidently is, it ought not to be adopted. So, Brutus is making this argument that look, you can't have a republic over such a vast territory, arguably the states are a little bit more attractable although even at this point some of the large states are quite large but they would have a better chance of being a free republic than merging all of the 13 states into what would effectively be one republic.."
Social Studies,"That was more than a decade after the Declaration of Independence. So there was this 11-year plus period before the United States had its modern day constitution and during that time, fought the Revolutionary War, won in 1783, and tried out a completely different system of government called the Articles of Confederation, which we talked a little bit more about in another video. Now the Articles of Confederation had a very strong sense of limited government."
Social Studies,"In fact, you could think of the Articles of Confederation as being a little bit more like a loose confederation of states, where each state had one vote in the legislative branch, the branch that makes laws, and they had to really agree on most things, nine out of 13 for most legislation and unanimous agreement for any kind of amendments to this system. And I think it's clear why the founders first went with this system of limited government because they had just revolted against a monarchy."
Social Studies,"They thought of the states as being in what they call just kind of a league of friendship, can almost see it as being similar to the European Union today, independent nations who do some things together for foreign policy reasons and economic reasons. Now by the late 1780s, it was becoming clear that the Articles of Confederation were not working. With such a weak central government, it was really hard to get things done. They couldn't raise taxes. They couldn't raise a military."
Social Studies,"Some states were even putting taxes on the goods of other states. So in 1787, delegates from 12 of the 13 states, Rhode Island did not participate because Rhode Island was not a big fan of central government, came together in Philadelphia, in the same place where they had signed the Declaration of Independence, to think about how to revise the Articles of Confederation. And some very notable figures were there. George Washington is one of them. See Ben Franklin over here, and James Madison."
Social Studies,"Although some people that you might have expected to be at the Constitutional Convention were not, namely, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams who were out of the country being diplomats at the time. So the delegates at the Constitutional Convention have a pretty difficult problem to solve."
Social Studies,"They want to have a stronger central government, one that can get things done, make sure the states play well together, raise armies, raise taxes, but they don't want a central government that is too strong because they just escaped from monarchy. They don't wanna recreate monarchy in the United States. So they're looking for a very delicate balance of a government strong enough to get things done but not so strong as to promote tyranny."
Social Studies,"Now even though the delegates were supposed to be revising the Articles of Confederation, some people had, in secret, been considering completely throwing out the Articles of Confederation and starting anew. But one of the biggest hurdles they had to solve was what would a new sort of legislature look like. So the Virginia delegates suggested a plan for the legislature, it's the law-making body, that would be bicameral, means two room or two house from bi, meaning two, and camera, Latin for room."
Social Studies,"And their idea was that there would be a lower house, similar to the House of Commons in English Parliament, that would be directly elected as individuals would vote for the representatives but the number of representatives that each state would get would be decided by their population. Now Virginia was the largest state by population by far and so, this plan would have worked out pretty well for them because they would have gotten the largest proportion of representatives."
Social Studies,"Small states like Delaware, and Georgia, Rhode Island, would have very few representatives indeed, comparatively. They also wanted to have an upper house, similar to the House of Lords in the British Parliament, which would be appointed by state legislatures. But just like the lower house, the number representatives would also be determined by population. Now as you can imagine, the small sates were not big fans of having representation based just on population, so they came back with a different plan."
Social Studies,"This was called the New Jersey Plan. So the little states said, ""All right, the Virginia Plan ""gives way too much power to the big states. ""We want an equal voice in legislation."" So the New Jersey Plan, much like the Articles of Confederation, gave one vote to each of the states so that the small states would have the same representation in Congress as the large states and their plan was for a single chamber or unicameral legislature."
Social Studies,"So this really wasn't much different from the Articles of Confederation at all. So how did the delegates resolve this issue of how to balance the voices of large states with large populations with small states that had small populations? Because in a situation where all states have an equal number of votes, like in the New Jersey Plan, the 60,000 residents of Delaware could have as much say as the almost 700,000 residents of Virginia. Meaning that the people who live in Delaware were in fact more powerful."
Social Studies,"But at the same time, you wouldn't want it so that people living in the larger states could get their way all the time. What if the people in Delaware had a very legitimate concern that those in Virginia didn't share? It would be impossible to get all of these states to agree, to amend, or replace the Articles of Confederation if some of them felt like their interests aren't being taken into account at all."
Social Studies,"So to solve this issue of how to weight the representation of the states, the delegates came up with what's called the Great Compromise or sometimes the Connecticut Compromise. And in a way, what they did was combine these two plans. They made a legislative branch that was bicameral, two house, with a lower and an upper house and this lower house become the House of Representatives, where each state would have representatives in proportion to their population."
Social Studies,"So states that have large populations have more representatives. States with small populations have fewer representatives. And those representatives would be directly elected by the people. Now, and this time, the people was a fairly small proportion to vote in 1790s. You had to be a white man with fairly significant property, so it wasn't full suffrage. It wasn't event full suffrage for white men, but these folks were elected by vote. And then this upper house would be the Senate."
Social Studies,"And in the Senate, each state would have two senators, regardless of their size, so that as legislation moved through Congress, first from the lower house, where it would be approved and if approved, sent to the upper house, there, all states would have an equal voice in whether legislation was passed. And in this upper house, the senators would not be directly elected but rather appointed by state legislatures. And in fact, senators were appointed into the 20th century."
Social Studies,Now the Great Compromise wasn't the only compromise made at the Constitutional Convention. They made a number more and we'll talk more about those and about the other two branches of the government in the next video..
Social Studies,"Did they think that the Revolution went too far, had created too much equality and too much liberty for people who weren't ready to deal with it? Or did it not go far enough? So let's talk about this idea that perhaps the Revolution went too far, that the average American Joe, or Jedediah, I guess, could be the Revolutionary version of Joe, had too much a sense of his own importance, was going to tear down the social structures that had seemed natural during the American Revolution, the wealthy elites, the middling farmers, the rough and rowdy workers."
Social Studies,"You'll remember that one of the incidents that led to the decision to revise the Articles of Confederation was Shays's Rebellion in which a group of unruly farmers, Revolutionary War veterans, had marched against the governor of Massachusetts. So the people were used to rebelling, and they first had rebelled against Great Britain. But now that war was over, and they started rebelling against state governments."
Social Studies,"So there's a real sense throughout the Constitution that the founders were attempting to balance democracy, a representative government, with what they saw as too much democracy or mobocracy in their words, that unruly mobs who perhaps lacked the virtue of elite, educated citizens would foolishly tear down government that they weren't prepared to be part of. Now, you see that in things like the Senate. The members of the Senate were appointed, not elected, up until the 20th century."
Social Studies,"The idea that there had to be one part of the legislative branch that was selected by the better sort of men, the sort of people who really knew what good leadership looked like, not by a mob that might be swayed by any fancy talking politician. The founders didn't want all white men to be able to vote. They wanted voting to be reserved to the elite, the propertied, the educated, those who were prepared to be virtuous citizens."
Social Studies,"It wouldn't be until the 1820s that all white men could vote in elections, regardless of how much property they owned. Of course, it wouldn't be until the late 19th and 20th centuries that women and minorities would get the right to vote. So they had a very dim idea of the average citizen's ability to engage productively in democracy. And another way that they show this in the Constitution is in the process of electing the president."
Social Studies,"Article II establishes the executive branch, and it also discusses how presidential elections shall work. And it's a kinda complex process, the electoral college. But the simple version is that instead of having citizens vote directly for the president, the citizens would vote in each state, and then that state would have electors equal to the number of senators and representatives. And those electors would then cast votes for the president, and whoever got the most electoral votes should be president."
Social Studies,"And we still have this system today. This is a map of the current number of electoral votes that each state has. And really, what the founders intended here was to have a safeguard of the office of the president, believing that it would be possible for a mob to be swayed, even the better sorts of citizens, into voting for a politician who wouldn't be good for the office."
Social Studies,And so they moved away from direct democracy into a slightly more complicated indirect system just to put an extra layer of safety in between the office of president and the unruly masses..
Social Studies,"Now, you'll remember that one of the issues that the electoral college was trying to solve was the idea that perhaps the revolution and the concept of democracy had gone too far in the United States and needed to be reined in by the more elite class of American citizens who would be better able to make political decisions. But the flip side of this was whether the revolution had perhaps not gone far enough. In that, it didn't abolish the institution of slavery."
Social Studies,"Now, the delegates at the Constitutional Convention had sharply divided opinions over slavery. Those who came from southern states tended to be elite white men, who were themselves slave owners their own fortunes deeply tied into the institution of slavery. In the aftermath of the revolution, many northern states began to either outlaw or phase out slavery, recognizing that it was incompatible with the system of government defined around the concept that all men are created equal."
Social Studies,"But if they were going to replace the articles of confederation, they were going to have to find a way forward. And I would say overall, the slaveowners got their way more than not. Now, one anti-slavery aspect of the constitution was that it outlawed the international slave trade, starting in 1808."
Social Studies,"So, here in article one, it states that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited by the congress prior to the year 1808, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten dollars for each person. So they say, we'll give the international slave trade 20 years and then we'll get rid of it. And indeed, on January 1st, 1808, the international slave trade was outlawed in the United States."
Social Studies,"So, this middle passage in which enslaved Africans were taken from west Africa and brought across the Atlantic, the end would never be in the United States. But this doesn't mean that they outlawed slavery, and it doesn't mean that they outlawed the domestic slave trade, the trade in slaves between states or within states. In fact, up until about 1850, one of the largest slave markets in the United States was just around the corner from the White House and the US Capitol."
Social Studies,"So, imagine walking on the streets of Washington DC and seeing these buildings where democratic ideals are enshrined and then going around the corner and seeing women and children and men being sold and families being torn apart. It's a very powerful image. But, although the framers did agree to phase out the international slave trade, they made another compromise that was much more favorable to slaveholders. The Three-Fifths Compromise."
Social Studies,"Now, you'll remember that in deciding how the legislative branch would represent the population, in the Great Compromise, or Connecticut Compromise, they agreed that in the House of Representatives, the proportion of representatives would be based on population, whereas in the Senate, every state would have two senators regardless of its size."
Social Studies,"Well, the big question for this is who counts as part of the population? Is it just white men? Or do the large enslaved populations of southern states also count? Now, if you were a southern slave holder, you would have been strongly in favor of counting this population, because it means you get more representation, and thus more power in the House of Representatives."
Social Studies,"If you were against slavery or from a small state, or both, you would've been bitterly opposed to the notion that people who have no rights as citizens should be counted as citizens to give those states more power in Congress. So, here's what they decided, according to article one."
Social Studies,"Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons. This three fifths of all other persons really means enslaved Africans. And you'll notice that the framers are really talking around slavery."
Social Studies,"In the part about the international slave trade, they said migration of such persons. Now they say three fifths of all other persons. In fact, the word slavery never appears in the original constitution. So, why do they say three fifths of all other persons or migration of such persons as states think it proper to admit? And honestly, I think the answer to this is that the framers were ashamed of slavery. They were ashamed that this institution existed in a democratic society."
Social Studies,"They knew that the eyes of the world, the eyes of history, would look at this document and this institution completely sullied the idea of a democratic government. So, as it says here, their agreement was that for every five enslaved people who lived in a state, three of them would be counted for the purposes of population. This is a huge victory for slaveholders, getting more power in Congress for having people who can't vote, who can't be citizens."
Social Studies,"Why did the delegates of other states allow this to happen? And I think the simple answer is that the constitution would not have been ratified were it not for this compromise, among others. The states of the south were too important to getting that nine out of 13 necessary votes to replace the articles of confederation with this new constitution. So, they made a compromise to make sure that the constitution was ratified and improved."
Social Studies,But that compromise would have tremendous consequences for the generations of enslaved people who would live under that system. And for the nation when the Civil War broke out in 1865..
Social Studies,"You have big states, like Virginia, which, at the time, had 750,000 people, and then you had small states like Delaware, that had 60,000 people, or you have Rhode Island, that has a little under 70,000 people. And so you can imagine, the Virginians, or the people from Massachusetts might have said, hey we want representation in the legislative, in Congress, to be based on population."
Social Studies,"It should be, you know, we have a lot of people, we should get more of a say, while someone from, say, Delaware, might say, wait, hold on a second, under the Articles of Confederation we were a sovereign state, we don't wanna just become, you know, do whatever the Virginians or the people from Massachusetts wanna do, we wanna have a more equal say, and of course, the big state folks would have said, whoa, no, then your population, people in your population, in your state, are going to be overrepresented."
Social Studies,"And so this was a serious debate, and it resulted in what is called the Great Compromise. The Great Compromise, which is probably the most cited compromise coming out of the US Constitution. And it's the notion of, okay, well let's have it both ways."
Social Studies,"In the legislative, let's create two houses, let's do one house that is based on population, so the House of Representatives, where Virginia will get more representation than a Delaware, but let's make another house called the Senate, where every state has equal representation, where you have two senators per state. And to appreciate that this is, even today, a controversial thing, here is an article from the New York Times, from 2013."
Social Studies,"This is an article that's talking about perceived inequalities of per person federal funding, and it says, and the article is literally named, 'Big State, Small State,' ""Vermont's 625,000 residents ""have two United States senators, ""and so do New York's 19 million. ""that means that a Vermonter has 30 times the voting power ""in the Senate of a New Yorker just over the state line, ""the biggest inequality between two adjacent states."
Social Studies,"""The nation's largest gap, between Wyoming and California, ""is more than double that."" So they're making the argument that, at least in the Senate, a person in Vermont has 30 times the representation as a person in New York, and if you compare Wyoming and California, it's a factor of 60. And they say, ""The difference reflects the growing disparity ""in their citizens' voting power, and it is not an anomaly."
Social Studies,"""The Constitution has always given residents ""of states with small populations a lift."" So this is coming straight out of the Great Compromise, ""but the size and importance of the gap ""has grown markedly in recent decades, ""in ways the framers probably never anticipated."" So you can imagine, this is the New York Times, so they probably might favor a little bit more representation for New Yorkers, but it's an interesting thing to think about. The Constitution was written over 200 years ago."
Social Studies,"Could they have predicted how much the United States would grow, or get a movement to the cities, even in that census of 1790, we saw a factor of a little more than 10 between a Virginia and, say, a Rhode Island, but now we're talking about a factor of 60 between California and Wyoming. There's no right answer, here, but it is something very interesting to think about and as you can see, it's something that people are even talking about today."
Social Studies,"Now, the other significant compromise that is also talked a lot about, these days, is the notion of the electoral college. So, people who are more in the anti-Federalist camp, they were more in favor of a participatory democracy, a direct democracy, where you have one person one vote, and whoever gets the majority of the vote in the country, well, maybe they should be president. But Federalists, especially folks like James Madison, they were a little suspicious of just the crowd voting whoever they wanted."
Social Studies,"They wanted it to go through a filter with the idea that maybe that filter could temper the passions of the crowd, so to speak, and so they devised this system where it isn't one person one vote, but every state has a certain number of electors. So you vote for electors, and then the states send them and then they can place their vote for President. It turns out that most states have decided to have a winner take all policy, so that maybe they could matter more for the Presidential election."
Social Studies,"But what that's resulted in, is if you take a big state, like Texas, and just draw a quick drawing of Texas, or a big state like California, right over here, in a winner take all, as soon as you cross 50%, you get 50.1% in either one of these states, and in other big states, it's true in most states, well then you'll get all of the electors for that state. So even if you get 70% of the vote in Texas, or 70% of the vote of California, it's equivalent to getting 50.1%."
Social Studies,"The reason why this has resulted in some significant debate, in the recent past, you had two major elections where the electoral college majority was different than the popular majority. You had Bush vs. Gore in 2000 and you have Trump vs. Clinton in 2016. Now, two of the other major compromises that came out of the Constitutional Convention are less debated today, and that's a good thing, because they were resolved, finally, in 1865 by the 13th amendment, that came out of the Civil War."
Social Studies,"And these were around slavery. You have the 3/5 Compromise, and this is, actually, still more of a notion around representation. Even in the House, how do you determine the population that's gonna dictate how many representatives you get? What about slaves? If you look back to this chart right over here, notice some of the southern states had a significant fraction of their population that were slaves. And so you can imagine that their delegates were saying, hey, we wanna count them in the population."
Social Studies,"They didn't want them to vote, but they said, hey, when we decide how many representatives we get, we wanna count these 293,000 people in Virginia when we decide how many representatives they get. And you can imagine, other states, either just because they didn't wanna dilute their own representation, or maybe even some of them might have felt morally against something like slavery, said, wait, no, you shouldn't get a benefit because you're doing this thing called slavery, and so they were against it."
Social Studies,"And so the compromise, and once again, James Madison was significantly involved here, was the 3/5 Compromise, that for determining representation, a slave would count as 3/5 of a person, which is offensive to our sensibilities, but that's the compromise they came up with, but it didn't become, it wasn't an issue anymore once slavery was abolished by the 13th amendment."
Social Studies,"The last major compromise that people will talk about, and this one also revolves around slavery, is the importation, importation of slaves. During the Revolution, because Great Britain had such a significant role in the slave trade, the colonies, or the states, the nascent states, were pretty unified around not participating, at least with Great Britain, but once the Revolution was over, this became an issue again."
Social Studies,"Some states did not want more importation of slaves, some did, and so the compromise that was reached is that at least for 20 years, the Congress would not pass a law that is prohibiting the importation of slaves. And it turns out, almost exactly 20 years later, once that expired from the Constitution, under Thomas Jefferson, they did ban the importation of slaves officially, although it still continued to some degree, at a much smaller level."
Social Studies,"I'll leave you there, but the big appreciation here is that those debates that we talk about, the Great Compromise, the electoral college, these debates around representation, that we saw over 200 years ago, these are things that people still feel passionate about, and they still debate today.."
Social Studies,"To learn more about Article five, I talked to two experts, professor Michael Rappaport, who is the Darling Foundation professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, where he also serves as the director of The Center for the Study of Constitutional Originalism and David Strauss, who's the Gerald Ratner distinguished service professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School and author of The Living Constitution."
Social Studies,"Professor Strauss, Article five provides this process for amending The Constitution, can you take us through that process a little bit? How does it work? - [Professor Strauss] Well the quick description of the process is it's really hard, it's really hard to amend The Constitution. There are actually a couple of different processes that are laid out in Article five but only one has ever been used."
Social Studies,"An amendment starts in Congress and two thirds of each house of Congress, two thirds in House of Representatives and two thirds of the Senate has to approved the amendment and then it goes to the states and three quarters of the states have to approve the amendment, so you have to have a really strong consensus in order to get The Constitution changed that way. - [Kim] So, Professor Rappaport, take us through this process of amending The Constitution."
Social Studies,"Why did the framers set it up this way? - [Professor Rappaport] The framers gave a good bit of thought to coming up with an amendment process because they recognized that The Constitution might need to be changed over time either 'cause there were problems with it that weren't anticipated or because circumstances or values changed, so, there are two steps to the amendment process, for an amendment to go into The Constitution to become part of The Constitution it has to be both proposed and ratified."
Social Studies,"On the proposal side, the Congress can propose, alternatively, a proposal can come from the action of the state legislatures, so, two thirds of the state legislatures say we'd like to have a Constitutional Convention propose an amendment, so, there's two parts to that, obviously, the the state legislatures have got to want it and then you get the calling of a Constitutional Convention. Okay, that's the proposal side, there's also the ratification side, which is a little bit simpler."
Social Studies,"You need three quarters of the states to ratify a Constitutional amendment and they can ratify it either through the actions of the state legislatures or the actions of state conventions, which are special bodies which would be elected in order to decide one question, whether or not to ratify that proposed Constitutional amendment. - [Kim] This is fascinating, so, I actually had no idea about the two thirds of the state legislatures being able to propose a Constitutional amendment."
Social Studies,"How often does that happen? - [Professor Rappaport] It has never occurred throughout our history, although, a couple of times there were actions taken to sort of move in that direction but we've never actually had a Constitutional Convention that has proposed any amendments. It's important to go into why the framers would have set up the system the way they did."
Social Studies,"The most usual situation is for the Congress to propose the amendments and that's happened in all of the 27 amendments which have been ratified to become part of our Constitution but what happens if the Congress is the problem? What happens if the Congress is usurping power or they're standing in the way of changes that are important or they need to be reformed? You can't count on the Congress to wanna reform itself so what they did was to have this alternative mechanism which would bypass the Congress and that alternative mechanism was the Constitutional Convention, so the state legislatures proposed, applied for, and the separate entity, the Constitutional Convention, makes a proposal, so they were quite explicit in discussing this, that they wanted this as an alternative to the Congress."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So was this on purpose that they made it very difficult to amend The Constitution? - [Professor Strauss] Well it sure seems like it. Now, of course, we don't know back then what they had in mind, whether they thought, ""Well, the House, the Senate, the states, ""they'll sort of be all run by the same kind of people ""and they'll kind of agree on things."" Maybe they thought that, we just don't know but whatever they were thinking, what they gave us was a very difficult process to get through."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, how long was it from the period when The Constitution was first ratified to the first amendment to The Constitution beyond the Bill of Rights? - [Professor Rappaport] Okay, so, the first 10 amendments were ratified in 1791 and then, just a mere three years later, we had the 11th amendment."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Strauss] There was an 11th amendment in 1798 to correct really kind of a technical problem that the Supreme Court did something that the framers really didn't anticipate it would do, didn't want it to do, and the 11th amendment was adopted to correct that."
Social Studies,"The 12th amendment was adopted in 1804, after the, really, kind of a disaster in the election of 1800, when there was a tie in the electoral college, the framers had not foreseen the rise of political parties and political parties made the system for electing the president they had given us very difficult to work with but then there was nothing."
Social Studies,"That was 1804, then there was nothing until after the Civil War and after the Civil War there were three amendments, then nothing again, really, until the progressive era in the early 20th century when there were, again, a bunch of amendments and then after then, things have sort of tailed off. So, we really see these kind of waves in our history."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] What do you think brings those waves on? Why are there some eras where there are lots of Constitutional amendments and then other eras when there's nothing? - [Professor Strauss] Well, Kim, here I'm gonna say something I think some people will disagree with but, you know, but I think it's right and that is that I don't think the process of amending The Constitution has really been the way we actually change it."
Social Studies,"I think what happens is just because the amendment process is so difficult, we've worked out other ways of changing things and so amendments come along, sometimes, because a change has already happened and people decide, ""Well, let's put it ""in The Constitution just so we can kinda have ""official recognition of it."" But a lot of time changes happen and they are a little bit too controversial to get into The Constitution but they seem pretty solid and pretty secure, so, we just don't, I guess it's fair to say, don't bother to amend The Constitution or don't wanna go through the process of amending The Constitution."
Social Studies,- [Professor Rappaport] Very often peoples' values may change or they may differ from what's in The Constitution and it may take a time or circumstances may finally occur that crystallize this desire to change The Constitution and all of a sudden the opportunity is there and people can suddenly pass a Constitutional amendment. It's only gonna occur during certain circumstances especially when there's strong support for it.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Very interesting, yeah, so it's unlikely that we're gonna have a Constitutional amendment anytime in the near future. When was the last Constitutional amendment? - [Professor Rappaport] So, the simple answer to that was in 1971 we got the 26th amendment that was both proposed and then, remarkably, it's an all time record, proposed and ratified in three months and eight days and that was the amendment that guaranteed the right to vote of 18 year olds."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Ah, right, so sort of as a response to the Vietnam War? - [Professor Rappaport] Yes, yes but there actually has been one additional amendment, the 27th amendment, right, so why isn't that the most recent one? Well, here's the funny thing about it, the 27th amendment was proposed as part of the original Bill of Rights in 1789, so this amendment was proposed in 1789, ratified in 1992, so it took 202 years."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] What you're saying, what's the 27th amendment about? - [Professor Rappaport] That has to do with congressional salary increases."
Social Studies,"It basically says if Congress wants to raise its own salary, the increase can't take effect until the next election, so it basically give the voters a chance to say, ""Hey, we don't like what you did, ""we're gonna vote you out of office ""for increasing your salary."" - [Kim] So, one thing that strikes me about Article five or just the fact that the founders included an amendment process altogether, it seems very humble and farsighted to include a way for the document itself to evolve in a way, do you think that the framers approached The Constitution with the idea that there were things in the future that they just wouldn't be able to anticipate? - [Professor Strauss] They had before them and were acutely aware of a history in which efforts to establish governments had failed and they were really trying to work with that and make sure they didn't do the same thing so they knew what a hard job they were embarking on and they made it clear, I mean, there's a famous passage in which James Madison said, ""Look, we know a lot of these provisions ""that we're writing in The Constitution ""their meaning is unclear and their meaning ""will have to be history's liquidated."" Which is to say, people have to figure out what this means because we know what we're giving you is unclear in some ways, so, yes absolutely they knew there were things they could not anticipate."
Social Studies,"The framers themselves weren't in agreement on what freedom of speech means, you know, some of them enacted and voted for and got enacted laws that restricted speech in ways that we would find intolerable today, we'd say they violate the first amendment but here you have some of the guys who drafted the first amendment voting for those laws."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, near the end of Article five, there's this kind of long-winded clause that says, ""No amendment which may be made prior to the year ""one thousand eight hundred and eight ""shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses ""in the ninth section of the first article."" Now, if I'm cross referencing this correctly, what they're really saying here is, you can't make amendments about slavery, so why is this here and why are they talking around it so obliquely? - [Professor Rappaport] The interesting thing about this is what do they do, they basically said, for 20 years there's not going to be any amendments that are going to speak to the slave trade and The Constitution is very, let us say shy, about using the term slavery or referring to slavery, it actually never refers to the term slave, there's a variety of thoughts about what was going on but one very common view about this is that The Constitution was sort of a little bit embarrassed, that the framers were a little bit embarrassed, or at least some of the framers were embarrassed about it and so they didn't wanna make reference to it too explicitly."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Strauss] They might've been a little bit worried about what the verdict of history would be, so, they knew on some level this sort of immorality of slavery but there it is, right there in Article five and there are other places in The Constitution too where they don't use the word but what they're doing is protecting slavery."
Social Studies,"And they did add these amendments to The Constitution about slavery and about, as you say, equal citizenship and voting but, you know, the 14th amendment providing equal citizenship, that was pretty much nullified in most respects for a large part of our history, states found a way to get around that."
Social Studies,"The 15th amendment was also something that was just not very effective in preventing African Americans from being denied the vote and, yes, there are provisions in The Constitution that are there and you can evoke them and you can rely on them but if you just look at the text of The Constitution, I think you get a misleading impression about how The Constitution in our history has actually worked."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] This is a very good point because I think one of the hardest things for students of U.S history to understand is how is it possible that after the 14th amendment was passed, things like Jim Crow happened and I guess the answer is The Constitution is only in force if it's enforced. - [Professor Strauss] Yeah, Kim, that's exactly right."
Social Studies,"It's words on a page, you know, the text is fine, it can say all the right things but the institutions and the popular will have to be in place to make something of those fine words."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, so how do you think our government might be different if The Constitution didn't include this amendment process? - [Professor Strauss] I don't think it would've been that different just because Article five gives us such a hard process to go through just because it's so hard to amend The Constitution, we figured out other ways to change The Constitution in practice, even if the words on the page are the same and I think if there were no Article five, we would've found a way to get to where wanted to get to as a country by those needs, by legislation, by presidential action, by Supreme Court decision, and just by the people in their lives saying, ""You know, we need to go in this direction, ""we need to go, say, in the direction of women's equality."" And, by the way, there's no amendment giving women equal rights either but that's where we've gotten to and I think that would've been the pattern if there were no formal amendment process."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Rappaport] There's a second way in which you can have Constitutional change, which is you could simply say, ""Alright, this Constitution was pretty good for awhile, ""it's now outlived its usefulness, ""let's have a new Constitution."" That would seem like a very radical, big thing to do, virtually no on proposes that at the federal level but in the states, lots of states have changed their constitutions, not simply passed a Constitutional amendment, but just gotten rid of a whole constitution and adopted a new one."
Social Studies,"That's happened many times and, so, if we didn't have a Constitutional amendment process, it's quite possible that that's exactly what we would've seen at the federal level."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Wow, this is really fascinating because we really think a lot about what the framers intended, you know, for certain amendments, for example, you know, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, what did they really mean by those things but if we had just kind of every now and again said, ""Okay, we're done with that, let's do a new Constitution,"" we wouldn't necessarily have that debate, we'd just say, ""Okay, this is what we meant at the time."" - [Professor Rappaport] Famously Thomas Jefferson said, ""Oh, you know, it's really not right to have ""a Constitution that's going to continue over time ""and bind future generations and, so, ""we ought to have a new Constitution every 19 years ""when there's a new generation."" And his close friend, James Madison, had to disagree with him and basically said, ""Look, I understand why you're saying that ""but you also have to realize the incredible disruption ""that would cause every 20 years, ""people wouldn't be able to rely on the existing rights ""that are in The Constitution 'cause they would know ""in a certain period of time new ones would be enacted."" We had that debate, Madison won in the sense that the U.S."
Social Studies,"Constitution is supposed to last for a long-term period, there's no 20 year limit on it, and one of the things that's been beneficial for the United States as a result of that is that we've inherited these Constitutional rights that people have a lot of reverence for."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, we've learned that there are two ways to amend The Constitution, through Congress or through a special Constitutional Convention called by the states, either way, adding an amendment to The Constitution is really difficult to do, so much so, that the American people have only in special circumstances used a Constitutional amendment to affect social or political change."
Social Studies,"To learn more about Article five, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"It covers debts, religious tests for office, and it establishes the constitution as the supreme law of the land. To learn more about what binds these diverse ideas together I sought out the help of two experts. Kermit Roosevelt is a professor of law specializing in Constitutional Law and conflict of laws at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. And, Michael Ramsey is professor of law and director of International and Comparative Law programs at the University of San Diego School of Law."
Social Studies,"So, let's start out talking about the debts portion of Article VI. Professor Roosevelt, why were the framers so interested in debt? What was the historical context that led them to explicitly address debt in Article VI? - [Kermit] Debt is important generally because nations often need to borrow money. And specifically, with the constitution and the Articles of Confederation the US Government had been borrowing money to pay for the Revolutionary War."
Social Studies,"So, there was a question, we're moving from a sort of loose confederation almost like a treaty between nations under the Articles of Confederation to a single unitary country with a stronger national government under the constitution. And, there's a question, is it still the same country? Will the new United States pay the debts of the old United States? - [Michael] Now, there's a general principal of international law that a successor government undertakes the obligations of the predecessor."
Social Studies,"So, you wouldn't necessarily think this would be a problem, but I think they were particularly concerned because the idea of a republic was a somewhat new one, at least in the 18th century, a somewhat unusual one. And, the change of a republican government might cause some worries in Europe where this money was owed. So, I think they just wanted to reassure all of the creditors that even if they were changing their method of government that that wasn't going to effect any of the debts."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] What might have happened if they decided not to pay those debts? - [Kermit] If they decided not to pay the debts than other countries would probably have been much less willing to lend money to the new United States because they might have thought, ""Well, you know, another change ""in government could occur."" - [Michael] There was substantial question throughout the world whether the United States would be able to survive in the face of all the challenges that they had after gaining their independence."
Social Studies,"So, in order to make it seem that the United States was a country that could be trust, a country that could be expected to stick around and not collapse into chaos or revert to colonial status one of the most important things for them was to show that the debts would be honored because a failure to honor debts would suggest that the country did not, in fact, have a true sovereignty and it was not prepared to be an actor on the international stage that could be trusted."
Social Studies,"- [Kermit] Another interesting thing to contrast this to is the treatment of debts after the Civil War where, of course, the United States, the federal government paid its own debts but there's a provision in the 14th Amendment explicitly repudiating the Confederate debt. So, if you loaned money to the Confederate States of America you're never getting that back because we didn't treat that as a valid government that would be continued going forward."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] Another thing that it illustrates is that the constitution, in some respects, was a visionary document that was concerned with a long term future of the United States. But, in other respects it responded to very immediate practical problems that the framers faced in their day. They were thinking about not just the future of the country for the ages, they were thinking about that, but they weren't thinking just about that."
Social Studies,"They were also thinking about reassuring France with respect to the debts that existed right at that moment. - [Kim] So, there's a lot going on in Article VI. And specifically, it talks about the constitution as the supreme law of the land. So, what's important about that statement? - [Kermit] What's important about that is that means the Constitution is our highest law. It prevails over any other kind of law in a conflict. So, one thing that that means is the constitution is supreme over state law."
Social Studies,"And then, the constitution actually goes on to talk about that a little bit more. But, it also means the constitution is supreme over federal law. So, everyone is bound by the constitution. The states can't go against it. Congress can't go past it. The president can't violate constitutional restrictions. The constitution is really the last word. It's the pinnacle or the keystone of the arch of American democracy."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] And, that's why we can say that things are unconstitutional, that laws are unconstitutional and therefore invalid. And, most importantly, it's why the Supreme Court can say that laws are unconstitutional and invalid. It creates a superior law that limits the laws that can be passed by the other parts of the government. It creates a hierarchy of laws. And, in doing so, it assures that we have a single set of rules that applies to all the states and to the federal government."
Social Studies,"And, it can't be changed except by an amendment, which is relatively difficult to do. There's a procedure in the constitution for how you can amend the constitution, but until amended the constitution, as written, is our superior law. And, that was different from the way that the rules that the framers were used to under the English system where they didn't have a written constitution. They had an unwritten constitution, but that constitution was subject to change by parliament."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, has the supremacy of the constitution been tested over time? - [Kermit] There haven't been a lot of claims that the constitution is not supreme. So, generally speaking everyone gives, at least, lip service to this idea. What's been tested is more the question of who gets to decide what the constitution means and when something conflicts with it."
Social Studies,"So, if you want the constitution and federal law to be supreme, probably you would want to have someone in the federal government deciding when there's a conflict, say with state law."
Social Studies,"And, the forms that resistance that has taken over the years are more states saying not, ""We can go against the constitution, we're above ""the constitution,"" but states saying, ""We don't think ""what we're doing violates the constitution,"" right, ""And you at the Supreme Court, you think it does ""but you're wrong."" - [Michael] In the 19th century just before the Civil War the Supreme Court decided in the Dred Scott case that African Americans could not be citizens to the United States, even if they were freed slaves."
Social Studies,"And, President Lincoln believed that that was wrong. He said that there was nothing in the constitution that denied that, the ability of them to be citizens. And, he said that the Supreme Court had misinterpreted the constitution. And, he would accept the Supreme Court's ruling in that regard. Later, in the 20th century, the Supreme Court held that the constitution barred segregation, particularly in schools in the Brown versus Board of Education case."
Social Studies,"But, many southern governors and other institutions throughout the south thought that the Supreme Court had gotten that one wrong. And, they refused to abide by what the Supreme Court had said the constitution means. - [Kermit] What they said was not the constitution doesn't bind us, but we know what the constitution means better than you, Supreme Court, you're wrong. You're making this up, it's political, it's not judging. - [Kim] Another thing that Article VI talks about is religious tests."
Social Studies,"Why were the framers so interested in preventing religious tests in government? What sort of historical evils were they trying to prevent? - [Kermit] So, this is connected to the basic idea of the separation of church and state. And, you separate church and state really to protect both of those things. So, you wanna protect religion from being corrupted by political considerations, but you also want to protect your political system from being a battleground between rival religions."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] So, where this comes from is that in England they had had a series of what they called Test acts. And, what the Test Acts did was it required that for people to be eligible for government offices that the people had to be members of the Church of England. And, that other religious groups they were barred by the Test Act from holding government office."
Social Studies,"So, actually many of those minority religions, many adherents of those ended up coming to the American colonies to gain some measure of religious freedom. The pilgrims were an example of that. There was a Catholic colony in Maryland. And, just generally speaking many of the people, many of the colonists who came over were people who were not part of the main established church in England. And so, you can see why they would not wanna have something like the Test Acts."
Social Studies,"And, they wanted to make clear that in the new national government that any religion or no religion would be allowed for government office holders."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Do you think it's true that we don't have religious tests or oaths in the United States? How about the practice of swearing on a Bible during the presidential inauguration? - [Kermit] Well, the practice of swearing on a Bible is very interesting, as is the fact that when the president recites the oath of office every president, going back to George Washington, has added on to the end of it, ""So help me God."" There's actually an oath in the constitution the president has to swear to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution."
Social Studies,"But, the constitution doesn't say, ""So help me God."" The presidents just add that on on their own. And actually, that sort of illustrates the way in which the constitution treats religion, which is it can't be part of government in an official sense, but we know that members of government are also people. And, they have religious beliefs that are important to them. And, we don't demand that they exclude religion from their lives, we just demand that it be separated from government authority."
Social Studies,"So, you can swear on a Bible if you want to. You don't have to. You can swear on some other religious book. We had a member of congress take an oath of office on a Quran. So, individual government officials are allowed to include religion in so far as it's about them personally. What you think is appropriate to mark this occasion, what solemnifies this oath for you, you can do that. But, we can't require it, and they can't make the exercise of their power religious in nature."
Social Studies,"So, you can't, as a government official, exercise your power on religious grounds. - [Kim] Something that strikes me about Article VI is that it addresses so many different things. Do you have a sense of why debts and constitutional supremacy and religious tests are all in one article. - [Michael] Article VI, as you said, is a little bit of a grab bag. It's not entirely clear how these different pieces of Article VI relate to each other."
Social Studies,"And, I think they were just things that the framers wanted in the constitution and didn't know, for sure, where else to put them. - [Kermit] I'm not exactly sure why the debts are there. If I had to say something about Article VI it would be it's sort of the glue that holds the constitutional architecture together. So, maybe the debts are in there to explain the continuity between the US government under the Articles of Confederation and the US government under the constitution."
Social Studies,"Then, the supremacy clause explains how all of the different parts of the federal system are supposed to fit together. And, what the supremacy clause is saying the constitution is above all of them. The constitution connects them all. Everyone has to abide by the constitution. And, it tells you the constitution is the highest law, then you've got federal law, and then below that is state law. So that, if there's a conflict between federal law and state law, the federal law is gonna win."
Social Studies,"And then, the last part of Article VI is sort of doing the same thing. Because, what holds a country together? What binds people into a single people? In a lot of countries at the time of the founding it was religion, right, religion was the glue that held the society together. And, if you weren't a member of that religion you were an outsider or you were a second class citizen. You would be shunned and not given equal rights in some ways."
Social Studies,"The last clause of Article VI says something sort of similar about America, except it explicitly says it's not religion that binds us together, right? No religious tasks can be required but you do have to take an oath. What do you have to pledge to support? You have to pledge to support the constitution. So, there again, it's telling you the constitution is what we all have in common. That's what makes us Americans. That really is the glue that binds our society together."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, we've learned that Article VI is, as Professor Roosevelt put it, the glue that binds the country together. In assuming the debts from the era of the Articles of Confederation Article VI established the continuity of the U.S. government. It also placed the constitution, not religion, as the supreme law of the United States. To learn more about Article VI visit the National Constitution Center's interactive constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"At least nine states had to ratify the Constitution in order to replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation. To learn more about the ratification process, I sought out the help of two experts. Mark Graber is the Jacob A. France Professor of Constitutionalism at the University of Maryland Francis King Kerry School of Law. Michael Rappaport is the Darling Foundation professor at the University of San Diego School of Law."
Social Studies,"Professor Graber, can you tell us a little bit about the political context of ratification? What was going on at this time as the framers tried to put a new Constitution into the fabric of the United States? - [Mark] Well, one central problem of the Articles of Confederation was the Articles required that all 13 states consent for any amendment."
Social Studies,"And it turned out, at this time, Rhode Island was a great outlier so Rhode Island wasn't gonna consent to much of anything, and, in fact, Rhode Island did not even send delegates to the convention that drafted the Constitution, so the framers knew that if you had the unanimous rule for ratification, it would not work. Instead they chose nine, it's about two thirds, three fourths, in part to make sure Rhode Island and one outlier could not prevent adoption."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] So, let's remember, there's two stages here in how the Constitution gets written and ratified. First, it's written in what's called The Drafting Convention, or the Philadelphia Convention, which was held during the summer of 1787, and in that convention, it's pretty much in agreement that the federal government needed to be made stronger, but that was just a proposal."
Social Studies,"In order for the Constitution to be ratified, it needed nine of the thirteen states and so it went to the second stage, and there things were, in some ways, gonna be more difficult, because there was a variety of viewpoints in the different states."
Social Studies,"The main question that came up in state after state after state was, was the federal government being given too much additional power? Under the previous regime of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government had very limited powers, and the Constitution was gonna give the federal government more power. - [Mark] They wanted a strategy that, once the balls started rolling, states that were slower were gonna be faced with a choice."
Social Studies,"You could get in on the inside, and maybe affect some changes early, but if you were left out, whatever happened would happen without you, and a lot of states, at the end, were fearful of being left out."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] This strategy worked, and as they went through in tough states, as time went on, so New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Caroline, Rhode Island, in order to get ratification, each time they promised, we'll have a Bill of Rights and those states added a list of amendments that they wanted added to the Constitution. - [Kim] So was it controversial that the framers decided that only nine states would be necessary to ratify the Constitution? - [Mark] Very controversial."
Social Studies,"One of these central points of anti-federalists was that this was illegal, that the existing Constitution said all states so therefore, only all states could change the Constitution. - [Michael] So in that respect, it was somewhat controversial. Another way in which it departed from the Articles is the Articles said you needed the state legislatures to approve the amendments, and the U.S. Constitution said, no, we want state conventions, special bodies elected by the people to approve these things."
Social Studies,"Why did they say that? Because they feared that the state legislatures, who would be losing a lot of power under the Constitution, would vote against it, so they wanted sort of to go directly to the people in these conventions and bypass the state legislatures. - [Kim] So we know that there were some opponents of this new Constitution. How close did they actually come to preventing its ratification? - [Michael] Well, it was a very close fight."
Social Studies,"We look back on it and eventually all 13 states are gonna ratify and it looks like, oh well, that wasn't too much of a trouble, but it was very close and things could have easily gone in the opposite direction. One of the ways in which it was close was that there were just very close votes. Massachusetts was 187 to 168. New Hampshire was 57 47. New York was 30 27. Very close votes. A couple of people changing their mind and that would have meant various states didn't ratify."
Social Studies,"In addition to that, some of the states actually did not ratify. The first thing that happened was Rhode Island, early on in the process, says, we don't like your horrible Constitution, they all expected that. We're not gonna hold even a convention. You want us to hold a convention, we're not gonna hold a convention. We're just gonna have a vote in state. And that vote in the state, 90% of the people voted against the Constitution."
Social Studies,"In a way, Rhode Island actually voted against ratification, although it didn't use the proper method. North Caroline, also, they held a convention, and they were very upset about there not being a Bill of Rights in the Constitution, and they just didn't approve it. They didn't disapprove it, they just did nothing, and they waited. And so, in a way, two of the states voted against ratification."
Social Studies,"- [Mark] North Carolina had not yet ratified when George Washington took office, so, in fact, when George Washington took office, there were only 11 states in the Union. At the end of the day, crucial people, I think, decided it was better to sign the Constitution and be in on the ground floor then stay out and see what happened."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, so, who are some of the major players involved here, and what were they arguing about? - [Michael] There were the federalists, who were arguing in favor of ratifying the Constitution, and the anti-federalists, who were arguing against ratifying the Constitution. The federalists, two of the very famous ones, are familiar names, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison."
Social Studies,"Those two people, that were also particularly important because they decided, Hamilton said, we're gonna have a tough time getting ratification in New York, we need to write some essays defending the Constitution. And so Hamilton and Madison cooperated together and wrote what we now call The Federalist Papers, which were simply essays written in the newspapers trying to urge the New York Convention to ratify the Constitution."
Social Studies,"Eventually those essays were sent to other states and became known, and now we've come to revere those essays as The Federalist Papers. But they were originally just kind of advocacy pieces for ratifying the convention. Now, there were also anti-federalists."
Social Studies,"- [Mark] The anti-federalists, in part, were simply people who opposed the Constitution, and just as is the case as say people opposed Obamacare from both the left and the right, people who opposed the Constitution opposed it for many different reasons, and one of their problems was they were not a united bunch. But, in general, these were people fearful of a very strong national government."
Social Studies,"They believed states were sovereign, they wanted to keep power local, and they were very fearful of what they perceived to be an elite who would run the Constitution after ratification. The names that people may know who were anti-federalist were people like Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams. - [Kim] So what were some of the major arguments made in favor of adopting this new Constitution? - [Michael] There were, I think, two types of arguments. People felt that the articles were not working properly."
Social Studies,"They had all kinds of problems, and one of the strongest arguments that the Federalist papers made was that if we don't fix this and make for a stronger union together, what'll happen is, we'll break apart. Look at what happens when you have a bunch of states all next to one another in a land area. We know what that looks like, it's called Europe, and what happens in Europe? They fight wars with one another all the time, and those wars are very problematic. You have to have big armies, standing armies."
Social Studies,"Now, there were also the particular arguments about what powers were missing that the federal government had. The main arguments were made was the federal government did not have enough power, so they didn't have, for example, the taxing power, and they didn't have a way of enforcing treaties against the states very well, and some of the states were putting tariffs up, so interfering with trade within the country."
Social Studies,"- [Mark] So, states would set tariffs on out-of-state goods, states wouldn't contribute to the national government. Second, we needed to present an united front to foreign governments. We were very worried, what would happen if South Carolina formed an alliance with England and North Carolina formed an alliance with France. That wouldn't be good, the country needed to speak with one voice."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Those are some of the arguments made for adopting the Constitution, what were some of the arguments against adopting this new Constitution? - [Mark] Well, first argument was, even though most anti-federalists admitted the Articles needed some repair, they said it's not really urgent. It's not like the house is gonna fall down tomorrow, it's just, you know, the wind is coming through and we can figure it out. We really want a better Constitution."
Social Studies,"The other arguments were the Constitution put too much power in the national government. It put too much power in elites. The fear was if you had national elections, only elites would win. If you had local elections, people the people actually knew would win."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] They thought, a big national government would be too far away from the people to know what they really needed, as opposed to state governments, which they perceived as being more personal, closer to the needs of individuals? - [Mark] Compare two kinds of elections."
Social Studies,"First, how many people really know anyone who runs for Senator, who runs for President, that you're on a first name basis with? Now, compare, you're in a school club, chances are when someone runs for an office in the school club, you know who they are."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] Another type of argument was, if you give the federal government this power, and even if, and the federalists would always argue that the power was limited that they were being given to the federal government, and the anti-federalists came back and they said, well, you say it's limited but what we know from historical experience is is that once a government's in power, it tends to seize more power."
Social Studies,"There's a lot of vague phrases in the Constitution and the federal government will use those vague phrases to assert greater and greater power. - [Kim] What were some of the strategies that the framers used to entice some of the opponents of a strong central government to ratify the Constitution? - [Michael] The first thing that they did was to try to build up momentum. They knew there were certain states which were strongly in favor of ratification. Small states, sometimes, wanted ratification."
Social Studies,"The first state that comes in is Delaware, and they vote 30 to zero for the Constitution, and a bunch of early states, so let's say the first five states all vote for ratification by pretty lopsided margins. That builds up a kind of momentum. Alright, we have five states, we only need four more. Of course, the next ones that were gonna come were gonna be much more difficult. They then needed to change their strategy at that point. - [Mark] They argued like crazy."
Social Studies,"The Federalist Papers are a very famous example. They indicated they'd be open to amendment once the Constitution was ratified. Then again, in Pennsylvania, when anti-federalists boycotted the convention, and the result is the convention didn't have a quorum, they ordered the sergeant-at-arms to a tavern. The sergeant-at-arms found some boycotting anti-federalists and physically put them in the building so they could count for a quorum. - [Kim] That is terrific."
Social Studies,- [Mark] That one doesn't get told in a whole lot of history books. - [Kim] Wow. - [Mark] The framers could play rough and tumble politics with the best of them.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] A lot of the things that pop up at the time of the framing, I think, we look back on today and imagine, how would this work in today's era, with 330 million Americans? Do you think the system under the Articles of Confederation with a smaller, more local, government could possibly work today? - [Michael] Well, among other things, the Articles had no great means of collecting taxes or gaining revenue."
Social Studies,"Given that modern government needs trillions of dollars, the Articles, if you've got a thousand dollars, it was a miracle, so the Articles clearly don't work. But the Articles were inadequate for 18th century government. They were clearly inadequate, or would be clearly inadequate, for 21st century government. Now, the Constitution appears to have been adequate for 18th century government, whether it is adequate for 21st century government is a fair question."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] One of the interesting questions about the Constitution is, how democratic is the Constitution? This debate about how democratic the Constitution is actually enters into the question about ratification. On one level, the Constitution was democratic because each state in these ratification conventions voted on whether to ratify by majority vote. On the other hand, at the federal level, the ratification requirement required nine out of 13, and the idea there would be, we needed more buy in."
Social Studies,"We needed a limitation on simple majority rule in order to make the system function well, in order to produce a Constitution that would have support from the whole country."
Social Studies,"The interesting thing about that supermajority rule, and something that people don't often make the connection with, is we probably owe our Bill of Rights to that supermajority rule, because if only seven of the 13 states, the minimum majority, had been needed to ratify the Constitution, then it's quite possible that the federalists wouldn't have had to promise to put a Bill of Rights into the Constitution, because they wouldn't have needed to."
Social Studies,"And they were initially quite opposed to putting a Bill of Rights in the Constitution. It was only the fact that they needed nine out of 13 states that really forced their hand and forced them to promise that they would put the Bill of Rights in there. We see, in terms of the ratification, that there's both sort of democratic elements but also republican, or supermajority, elements. - [Kim] We've learned that it wasn't easy to ratify the Constitution."
Social Studies,"The framers bypassed state legislatures and went directly to the people in state conventions, hoping that momentum and arguments for a stronger federal government would entice the opponents of the Constitution to ratify it. It took until 1789 for nine out of 13 states to ratify the Constitution and finally make it law. To learn more about Article VII, check out the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"But this is a great passage. If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself."
Social Studies,"And it goes on to talk about how we can keep government from becoming too powerful by so contriving the interior structure of the government as that its several constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places."
Social Studies,"And so remember, this was in defense of the Constitution, so arguably this was in place, that somehow this Constitution had contrived an interior structure so that the several constituent parts of government, by their mutual relations, would keep each other in their proper places, or you could even say keep each other in check. So in line with this passage, there's really two big ideas embedded in the Constitution as to how our government is structured. The first is this notion of separation of powers."
Social Studies,"We have three branches of government. You have your executive, headed by the president. You have your legislative branch, which is Congress. Legislative. And you have your judicial branch, which is the US Supreme Court. And this notion of separation of powers is that you have these fairly independent branches of government, and the idea was to make them reasonably independent so that one group, one branch, could not take over the others."
Social Studies,"The legislative branch, Congress, they're charged with budget, and they're charged with creating and passing laws. The executive branch, headed by the president, is supposed to execute, run the government, based on the laws that Congress passes. And you have the judicial branch that would decide whether things, say laws that Congress is passing, or actions that the executive's taking, they say, ""Hey, is that constitutional?"" Or they can interpret laws."
Social Studies,"So these different powers are put into these different branches. The powers are separate. Now related to that is another very powerful idea, and this is keeping each other in their proper places, and so this is the idea of checks and balances. Each of these can't do whatever they want. They're all balancing each other. They all have checks on each other. For example, the executive can veto the legislative branch, can veto a law passed by Congress, but then the legislative branch can override that veto."
Social Studies,"The legislative branch, they control the budget, so it's not like the president or the executive can do whatever they want, or that they can just spend as much money as they want, and the judicial branch, in both cases, can be a check, and they're saying, ""Hey, you're doing something ""that is unconstitutional,"" or, ""We're going to interpret the laws ""that the legislature has passed."" The executive appoints the judicial, but even there, you have to get congressional buy-in."
Social Studies,"So once again, you have these independent branches of government, all the power isn't in one, and they are interdependent. They provide checks and balances on each other, and this is all about what Federalist 51 is talking about, so that by their mutual relations, they are the means of keeping each other in their proper places.."
Social Studies,"And then you have the judicial branch that decides on the constitutionality of laws and actions by the government as well as interprets existing laws. And connected to this idea of separation of powers where each of these branches are somewhat independent but not completely independent, is that they all have checks and balances on each other."
Social Studies,"We've talked about in multiple videos, the executive can veto a law by the legislative, the legislative can override that veto, the legislative decides on the budget that the executive has to run the government, the judicial branch decides on constitutionality, the executive branch decides who is even going to become a justice in the Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"And so when you have this separation of powers and you have this checks and balances, it provides multiple opportunities to influence policy and the actions of government. And there's two ways that you could view influence. You could view it as a positive thing, after all, it's government by the people, the people are sovereign so they should be able to influence what the government does."
Social Studies,"But sometimes, a cynical view of influence is well, who gets to influence? And is it really by the people or are there other interests, maybe driven by things like money that have undue influence? But just to get sense of how folks can influence or where there are points of influence is, well first, what laws get passed? or what gets funded? That's decided in the budget."
Social Studies,"Now, as an individual, as a citizen you can write letters to your congress person, you can petition them, you can call them up, you can show up at a town hall that they hold in order to speak your voice. But there's also interest groups. Now interest groups could be corporate interest groups, they could be unions, they could be professions, and these interest groups will often times also lobby congress in order to influence what gets funded or the laws that get passed or don't get passed."
Social Studies,"And the word lobbying really is just this idea of trying to influence the government. Now a major way, a major point of influence in the United States is when there are elections. Who actually gets elected. And so you can imagine, there could be direct support, endorsement for different candidates, money, especially with mass media, becoming more and more important, becomes a bigger and bigger part of elections."
Social Studies,"So you can donate at an individual level or you often see now, and this is a very controversial area where there's heated debates on to what degree large donations can be made, to what degree corporations can influence elections, but who gets elected is perhaps the biggest lever on our government."
Social Studies,"For example, even if your main concern is judicial and the judicial is the one branch that is most immune from elections, Supreme Court justices are not elected, they are appointed by the president with approval from the senate. But if you did care who is going to be in the judiciary, well there, there would be a strong motivation to influence who is going to be president and then even once they are president, there might be some influence, some lobbying, on who they appoint to the judiciary."
Social Studies,"If a law gets passed by congress, there's still another outlet. You could petition the executive to veto that law. So I'll leave you there. The main takeaway from this is that because of these checks and balances and separation of powers, there's multiple levers of influence in the government and I've just touched on a few on them."
Social Studies,"An interesting thing to always think about is how much of our current levers of influence, especially as they exist today in our modern government, how much of this was intended by the founders of our country, the authors of the Constitution, and how much is based on things that we could have never predicted? They could've never predicted the size of the country? They could've never predicted the influence of mass media? They could've never perhaps predicted the influence of money? Who knows."
Social Studies,I will leave you with that question..
Social Studies,"Where you have these three, somewhat independent branches of government. You have the Executive Branch, headed by the President of the United States, in charge of running the state, running the government. You have the Legislative Branch, which in the United States has two houses, you have the House of Representatives and you have the Senate. And it's in charge of passing laws and deciding on the budget that the government, that the Executive Branch uses to run the government."
Social Studies,"And we have the Judicial Branch, which is the US Supreme Court. And related to this idea of separation of powers, they're not completely independent, but it's designed to be in a way that not one group or no one group can overrun the others. And what helps them do this is this idea of checks and balances. That for example, the Legislative can pass a law, but the Executive Branch can veto it, but the Legislative can override that veto."
Social Studies,"You have the Judicial Branch that can decide on the constitutionality of a law that the Legislative Branch passes or even an action that the Executive Branch takes. And it can even interpret the laws that have already been passed. The Executive Branch can appointment the members of the US Supreme Court. So, you see this idea of checks and balances. And perhaps the biggest check that the Legislative Branch has, is the idea of impeachment."
Social Studies,"So what is it? So, some people believe, or are under the impression, that impeachment is, if someone gets impeached they are removed from office, that is not the case. Impeachment is really a formal accusation, in legal terms you might hear the word indictment. Indictment is a formal accusation. And so if the US House of Representatives with the majority vote decides to make a formal accusation against, say, the President, that would be impeachment."
Social Studies,"But even if that passes, then the Senate will try the President, to decide if they will actually be convicted. So, once the indictment happens and this would be the House that does this with just a simple majority, then the Senate, so this is the Senate right over here, they're going to decide whether to convict the individual, which could be the President, or they might acquit, which is saying that formal accusation is not valid."
Social Studies,"Now another thing to appreciate is, the Senate can't send the President to jail, but what they can do is remove them from office and keep them from holding office in the future. Now historically, only two President have been impeached. This right over here is a drawing of the impeachment proceedings for President Andrew Johnson in 1869, 17th President of the United States."
Social Studies,"And he was impeached, which means the House of Representatives, had a majority saying that he did a high crime and misdemeanor, and we'll talk more about that in a little bit. Which officially by doing that indictment that made it an impeachment, so he has been officially impeached."
Social Studies,"They claim that he violated the Tenure of Office Act, which prevented the President from firing cabinet members without congressional permission, but he decided to fire his Secretary of War, which is now called the Secretary of Defense, without congressional approval and so they impeached him. But he did not get convicted, he was acquitted, the Senate was not able to get the two-thirds majority. The other President to be impeached is much more recent."
Social Studies,"This is President Bill Clinton in 1998, the US House of Representatives with a simple majority was able to impeach him on accusations of obstruction of justice, so that you can imagine is something that prevents a prosecutor from, say, finding information and perjury, which is lying under oath. But once again, even though he was impeached, when it went to the Senate, they weren't able to get the two-thirds super majority, to remove him from office."
Social Studies,"So, neither of them, even though they were both impeached, were actually removed from office. The closest that a President actually got removed from office from something that was like impeachment was Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon was about to be impeached, but he resigned instead of having to go through the impeachment proceedings and then possibly getting convicted. But to really appreciate what impeachment is, let's just go straight to the original text in the Constitution."
Social Studies,"This is from Article I, Section 2, Clause 5, The House of Representatives shall chuse, and this is actually how they spelled the word choose in the Constitution. The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. So, once again the impeachment is just the formal accusation it actually gets tried by the Senate to decide if the person is actually guilty of that accusation."
Social Studies,"When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside. So, once again, we often associate impeachment with the President, but this is making clear it's not just about impeaching the President. When it is the President, who's being tried, it would be the Chief Justice who presides over the proceedings, in the Senate. And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present."
Social Studies,"So, in the House, if they can get to over 50%, then the accusation is formal, the person is essentially being indicted, which is called impeachment, but they're not going to be convicted without two thirds of the Senate. I encourage you to think about why the threshold here is higher. Why the founders of our country decided to make this threshold two thirds instead of a simple majority."
Social Studies,"Judgment in Cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to the Law."
Social Studies,"So, here they're saying, the most that the Senate can do, through the impeachment proceedings is remove them from office and maybe prevent them from holding any other office, but they can't send them to jail, the same way the traditional legal system could. But if someone really did commit a crime, they still will be subject to the traditional legal system."
Social Studies,"Finally, we see here in Article II, The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. And there's actually two points of ambiguity here. Who falls under all civil officers of the United States? Does a member of congress fall into that category? This is actually a matter of some debate."
Social Studies,"And what is a high crime and misdemeanor? Most people understand what treason and bribery are. But what is a high crime and misdemeanor? And this has been subject of debate. What is an impeachable offense? And to answer that question, I'll leave you with a quote from Gerald Ford, who became President when Richard Nixon resigned because he was about to be impeached and this is what he had to say."
Social Studies,"""An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the ""House of Representatives considers it to be at a given ""moment in history; ""conviction results from whatever offense ""or offenses two-thirds of the other body,"" the Senate, ""considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal ""of the accused from office."" So, he's taking a very pragmatic stance here."
Social Studies,"You have this notion of high crimes and misdemeanors, what does that mean? And Gerald Ford is saying, well, whatever the House of Representatives thinks that means. And so an interesting question is, how susceptible does this make the notion of impeachment to politics? And is that okay? And maybe the founders of our country recognized that and that's why they had a higher threshold for actual conviction and removal of office in the Senate.."
Social Studies,"It's referring to a government that has various layers where you could have the national government, often known as the federal government, and then you have the states, and you're gonna have multiple states over here, and then you could have even further layers, and in the United States you indeed do. You have the local governments, and even within the local you have city governments, you have county governments."
Social Studies,"The analogy that's often made is originally the federal idea was kind of like a layered cake, so this is my best attempt at drawing a quick layered cake, where you could view each layer as one of the layers of government. So when I cut open that cake, maybe right over here this blue layer right over here, it's blue flavored cake, maybe it's an ice cream cake of some kind, that might be the federal government. Then this yellow, maybe it's mango-flavored, that would be the state government."
Social Studies,"And then you have your strawberry-flavored local government. That is one view of federalism, but it turns out in the United States, especially over the passage of time this has gotten mixed up a little bit. So even though the United States might have started a little bit closer to something like this layered cake, today it is more of a marble cake where the different layers and their powers are more mixed together, and so this is my attempt to drawing the mixing of these various powers."
Social Studies,"And not only do they mix, they overlap. That different layers of our federal government, some have exclusive powers, which means that's the only layer that has them, while some of them, while sometimes there are concurrent powers, which means these are powers that multiple layers might actually have. Now to appreciate what these exclusive and concurrent powers are, here's a Venn diagram that shows some of them. So on the left-hand side right over here you have your exclusive federal powers."
Social Studies,"So in the United States, only the federal government can coin money. You can't have money from Texas or California. Only the federal government can declare war, which is related to the idea of conducting foreign affairs, which once again, only the federal government can do. That's also related to raising armies, once again, only the federal government. Rules of naturalization, who becomes an immigrant, who gets a green card, who becomes a citizen, all determined by the federal government not by the states."
Social Studies,"And the federal government regulates not just foreign affairs, but foreign commerce, trade agreements, and how is trade done. They're regulating between the states. Now exclusive powers to the states, they conduct elections. You might say, ""Wait, wait, wait. ""Hold on a second. ""Aren't there federal elections?"" Well it turns out, even for election for a president, the elections are conducted by the state government. Remember, we have the electoral college."
Social Studies,"They want to figure out who should that state's electors vote for. Establishing local governments; what are the counties, what are the various jurisdiction within a state? Similarly, intrastate commerce, that's regulated by the state, about the commerce that happens within the state. And then the Constitution allows the states to be the main power in ratifying constitutional amendments. The Senate and House can propose amendments, but 3/4 of the states have to vote to ratify constitutional amendments."
Social Studies,"Now what we see in the middle of this Venn diagram, these are concurrent powers, which means that they are common to both federal and the state governments. You can have federal taxes and you can have state taxes. In fact, most of us have both. There are federal laws and there are state laws. Similarly, there's federal law enforcement, you can think of the FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and of course you have state police and local police."
Social Studies,"The chartering of banks, eminent domain, which we might do another video on in the future, but this is the idea that a government can view taking land as the interest of the broader good in order to put down power lines or a highway and ideally compensate the people that it takes from if it's for the greater good. Establishing courts, you have a federal court system and a state court system, which we'll talk more about in future videos."
Social Studies,"And borrowing money, they both can issue bonds if they want to have a large project or to finance their deficit. All of these things are concurrent powers. Now this list is not exhaustive for any one of the three, for the exclusive federal powers, the concurrent powers, I'll do this dot, dot, dot here, and the exclusive state powers."
Social Studies,"And one thing that you will see, even certain exclusive state powers, so for example, education is for the most part considered an exclusive state power, but then you might say, ""Hold on a second. ""Isn't there a federal department of education?"" I'll do that over here. And the way this is a good example of how the federal government, even when something might be more of an exclusive state power where the federal government can still influence it. And they do that through grants."
Social Studies,"So even though the states and local governments might run the schools, the federal government might say, ""Hey, if you do X, Y, and Z, which we want you to do, ""then we will give you more funding for your schools,"" and so that might be motivation for the states to listen to the federal government. So I will leave you there. This is super important to understand if you want to understand how the United States works, and frankly, most governments in the world today.."
Social Studies,"And it's been mixed more in the favor of the national or the federal government, even though certain powers were historically more associated with the states, as we will see, there are several levers that the federal government has used in order to extend its power into the domain of what used to be associated with primarily the states. So one is the notion of categorical grants."
Social Studies,"So these are grants for a specific purpose where the federal government says, hey, states, we're gonna give you some money, but you've gotta use this money in exactly the way that we're telling you. Now, to be clear, not all grants are categorical grants. You have things like block grants where the federal government can give a grant to a state and say, hey, use this to generally improve the safety of your citizens. That would still give a lotta leeway to the states."
Social Studies,"But in categorical grants, it's very specific in terms of how the states are to use that money, even if historically it was something where the states had the powers. So an example of this would be the federal program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC. And to get a idea of how prescriptive it is, here is an outline of the program on the USDA website, a federal government agency."
Social Studies,"And if we go down here, you can even see things like income requirements, and they'll be income eligibility guidelines. These are set by the federal government, not by the states. Along those lines, you also have mandates. So a mandate is the federal government tying funding to one thing based on state compliance with another thing. For example, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which was passed in 1984, ties federal highway funds to states raising their minimum drinking age to 21."
Social Studies,"And I had direct experience with this act when I was growing up in Louisiana. Louisiana decided not to comply by the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, so the drinking age was 18, but because they didn't comply, they weren't getting as much federal funding for highways, and the highways weren't as good as in other states."
Social Studies,"So even though the drinking age is something that might be considered a state power, the federal government was able to exercise a lot of influence on most states by tying what the federal government wanted to highway funds. Now, outside of these examples of the federal government tying state funds to the states doing what the federal government wants, the federal government has also made use of the U.S. Constitution in order to broaden its powers. In particular, the Commerce Clause, Article I, Section 8."
Social Studies,"You might remember, that's the part where they say the Congress shall have power, and then they list a bunch of powers, but one of them, the Commerce Clause, is to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. And the key part of the Commerce Clause is among the several States."
Social Studies,"Over the course of American history, this ability to regulate interstate commerce, commerce between states, the federal government has used that to justify regulations and laws that focus on issues that may at first be perceived as a state power but use the argument that it affects interstate commerce in order to regulate it."
Social Studies,"And as you can imagine, when you have free-flowing commerce between states, you have the same currency, you don't have tariffs between states, many things that you would traditionally view as the power of the state, one could argue, would have some influence on interstate commerce."
Social Studies,"One notable example of this would be federal drug laws where a state could decide to, say, legalize marijuana, but the federal government can make it pretty difficult by regulating how is that marijuana transported? Or where does the cash for that marijuana get deposited? Does it get deposited in a bank that has associations with the Federal Reserve that needs to transfer that money across state lines? So the Interstate Commerce Clause has more influence on state affairs than you might initially think.."
Social Studies,"Article IV lays out the nuts and bolts of how federalism, the system of shared governance between the states and the federal government works in practice. Article IV has four sections. The first two, the Full Faith and Credit clause and the Privileges and Immunities clause talk about how states will treat each other's citizens as well as they treat the citizens of their own states."
Social Studies,"Then the third section, is an admissions clause discussing how new states will be added to the union and the fourth section is the guarantee clause, which guarantees every state in the union a republican form of government. To learn more about Article IV, I sought out the help of two experts. Erin Hawley is an associate professor of Law at the University of Missouri. Her scholarship focuses on the federal courts and she teaches constitutional litigation, tax policy and agricultural law."
Social Studies,"Professor Gabriel Chin is the director of clinical legal education at the UC Davis School of Law. He's a teacher and scholar of immigration law, criminal procedure and race and law. So professor Hawley can take us a little bit through why the framers included Article IV."
Social Studies,What was its purpose? - [Erin] The founders of the Constitution were very concerned that the federal government be one of limited powers and because of that they saw the states as having an active and critical role in placing a check on the federal government. So we've got the three branches and their own checks and balances and then we've got the federal government and the state government also playing a role in checking and balancing each other.
Social Studies,"They wanted to establish a strong central government but also to ensure that it didn't have too much power and the states were critical to this effort. Also, they very much wanted the states to act collectively not individually. As you'll recall, the states had not been doing so well under the loose articles of the confederation. They've sort of being going it alone on critical issues like trade and defense as to the detriment of the union."
Social Studies,"So Article IV is also a sort of key to making sure that the states act sort of as a unified whole rather than going it alone. - [Gabriel] It's one country made up of diverse states. And if you prefer the way things are done in Nevada you can move there. And if you think that some other state has a better set of answers to the problems of modern life, you can move."
Social Studies,"What the Full Faith In Credit clause, and the Privileges and Immunities clause are designed to do is to facilitate transactions, to facilitate moving, to facilitate communications and commerce and trade and travel among the states. But that doesn't mean that what's going on in each of the states can't be very, very different. - [Kim] We often think of checks and balances as being something that was designed to be kind of horizontal."
Social Studies,"That the legislature and the executive branch and the judicial branch kind of all at the same level checking each other. But there is also kind of this vertical checks and balances happening too between the power of the federal government, power of the states and the power of the local governments. - [Erin] Absolutely so we've got the three branches, and their checks and balances."
Social Studies,"We also have a strong central government, that's checked in large part by strong independent sovereign governments in each of the 50 states. And these states traditionally have what are known as police powers so they have a lot of inherent authority to govern the people in those states, subject to federal law."
Social Studies,"But it really does sort of place a check on federal authority and I think this is precisely what the framers wanted because they did want a strong government, but they also were very much of the view that states were important. That their own states we're important and they didn't want to lose that in the new constitution and new federal government."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] There are four sections in Article IV and the first section deals with full faith and credit, it says full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public Acts, Records and Judicial proceedings of every other state. So what does full faith and credit actually mean? - [Gabriel] It's designed to make in a certain sense, all of the states of the United States part of a single system."
Social Studies,"And so, full faith and credit means that a court judgment for example in one state will be recognized in every state. - [Erin] So if you have a value judgment in New York for example, and you move to California, the California courts are required to give effect to that judgment, to that same court judgment so long as it was validly issued."
Social Studies,"There was a federal statue known as The Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA that was passed under president Clinton, and recently the Supreme Court struck that down as unconstitutional. So now under full faith and credit, if you're married in one state you're married in another state as well."
Social Studies,- [Gabriel] You can see the kinds of problems that would exist if states didn't honor the legal decision that were made by other states such as who is married or who is divorced or who owns a particular piece of property or whether a particular child is going to be in the custody of one parent rather than another.
Social Studies,"And the full faith and credit clause is designed to say, in order for our system to work as a unified whole, while it's true that the courts of Georgia are distinct from the courts of New York, etc. They're separate systems, but they have to treat the work that each other does with respect. - [Kim] If we move onto section II. This says that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states."
Social Studies,"So what are these privileges and immunities? - [Erin] So the privileges and immunities clause has been one that's subject to a number of sort of debates in the courts, in the academic literature. But basically privileges and immunities have been construed to be those sorts of things that would go with citizenship. So the right to travel for example, is a privilege and immunity. Those sorts of things."
Social Studies,"- [Gabriel] Occasionally in American history there have been moments where states didn't want to let citizens of other states come through. So during the depression there was an effort by some states to limit the migration of people from out of state to in-state. And the Supreme Court said, that's not permissible. It also protects the right to travel. In 1999 the Supreme Court dealt with a case called Saenz v. Roe. And what that case was about is that California had relatively generous welfare benefits."
Social Studies,"And California wanted to set up its law in such a way that it wouldn't encourage people from other states to move to California just to get the welfare benefits. So what they did is, they said that if you don't live in California. If you're moving from out of state and you apply for welfare benefits then we're going to give you the welfare benefits that you would have gotten in your state for the first year. We're not going to give you the higher California benefits."
Social Studies,We're going to give you whatever you would of gotten where you came from. That's unconstitutional and the Supreme Court said that violates the privileges and immunities clause. We're one country. One nation. People are allowed to cross the borders whenever they want.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting but there is this second part of it that says no person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence, of any law or regulation therein be discharged from service or labor. So what is that all about? - [Erin] So that is one of the most unfortunate, probably the most unfortunate clauses in our Constitution, it's known as the fugitive slave clause and that title is pretty descriptive."
Social Studies,"So if you have a slave who is validly owned as it were in those days, under one state's law and that person escaped to a free state this clause gave the owner the right to reclaim that slave and put them back into sort of ownership in their own state. - [Gabriel] It is a sneaky way of talking about slavery and this compromise with slavery was necessary to create the United States. Slavery, the word, isn't used in the Constitution. They only use these euphemisms."
Social Studies,These sort of complicated circumlocutions and there is an argument that there is a reason for that. And the reason for that is that a lot of the framers of the Constitution didn't support slavery. Opposed slavery. They did think that it was important to have a United States and to have a Constitution. So they wanted to do what was necessary to achieve that but they did the absolutely minimum and they did it in such a way that consciously doesn't recognize and legitimize the institution of slavery.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Alright so, then we get into new states and territories. So, I think it was very forward looking of the framers to recognize that new states might want to join the Union and then to provide a process for that. So can you tell us a little bit about what that process was like? - [Erin] So article IV section three clause one provides the process for admitting new states."
Social Studies,"Again it recognizes that new states might want to join the Union and it gives wide latitude to congress for admitting new states, so basically the process was that a territory would indicate to the congress that it wished to become a state. Then they would submit a constitution and congress would approve the new state. But the constitution itself in article IV places some limitations on that."
Social Studies,Some of the eastern states we're concerned that the large western territories might become too influential so they had a couple of provisions that no new states could be created out of an old state nor could parts of states be combined to form a new state unless there was consent from all of the involved states. - [Gabriel] And it's not so clear that purchase of territory from foreign governments was a power that was granted in the Constitution to anyone.
Social Studies,"Thomas Jefferson who was the president at the time of the Louisiana Purchase had doubts that the Louisiana Purchase was constitutional. He thought that it was a great idea to purchase all that land from France, but he thought that it would require a constitutional amendment for the United States to have that power. This is different from Texas joining the Union. But the House and the Senate didn't have the same qualms that President Jefferson did."
Social Studies,"And so they agreed to approve the Louisiana Purchase and to fund it. When the bill got to Thomas Jefferson's desk he signed. - [Kim] Moving on to section IV, there is this promise here that the federal government will guarantee every state a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion or domestic violence. What does this mean? - [Erin] So we see here in Article IV the end of Article IV a really sort of famous, an important promise to each of the individual states."
Social Studies,"The federal government is promising, to basically aid them in keeping a republican form of government. As well remember, Benjamin Franklin famously said we've given you a republic if you can keep it. - [Gabriel] So when we talk about invasion in section IV, it talks about invasion, it's pretty clear that what they're talking about is invasion by some hostile state."
Social Studies,"And of course during this period there was continuing conflict with England and the idea is that if New York or South Carolina gets invaded by England, that's not just that particular state's problem it's the nation's problem and the national government has an obligation to protect against invasion. - [Kim] I imagine it also prevents someone from for example declaring themselves the King of Maryland. - [Gabriel] The republican form of government clause does that."
Social Studies,"It leaves the details to the states but the basic idea is that there has, the concept of republican government that's embodied in article IV is majority rule. That even if there were free and fair elections the state could not choose to have military or hereditary government."
Social Studies,"So even if everybody in California got together, and said you know, what we really need is a good family that generation after generation will lead us and they will be the kings and queens of California, and this is what we want so we're going to amend our constitution to provide for hereditary leadership in our state and we're going to find somebody great and this is what we want to do. Article IV would say, we can't choose to do that even through democratic means."
Social Studies,- [Kim] So as we've learned Article IV requires states to give full faith and credit to the legal proceedings of other states and to treat the citizens of other states as well as they treat their own citizens. It provides a process for adding new states into the mix and guarantees a republican form of government to the citizens of all the states. Article IV binds the United States together so it's not just a collection of independent states but rather a unified nation.
Social Studies,To learn more abour article IV visit the National Constitution Centers in Directive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics..
Social Studies,"So in a previous video, we talked about the enumerated powers that the Constitution gives the federal government. In particular, we have talked about the Commerce Clause that allows the federal government ""to regulate Commerce among the several states,"" which has turned out to be a much farther-reaching power than maybe the drafters of the Constitution intended. And then, the thing that really gives power to even the enumerated powers is the necessary and proper clause."
Social Studies,"""To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper ""for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers,"" and so this is what we talk about, this necessary and proper clause, creates a lot of implied powers. So you can imagine, this isn't, the necessary and proper clause is not something that made the Antifederalists very happy. They were worried about power grabs by the federal government. And so you have the Bill of Rights which are the first 10 amendments."
Social Studies,And the 9th and 10th amendment in particular are Antifederalists' attempt to limit the federal government's power.
Social Studies,"So the 9th Amendment says, ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, ""shall not be construed to deny or disparage others ""retained by the people,"" and even more important, the 10th Amendment, and this is really speaking to federal versus state powers, ""The powers not delegated ""to the United States by the Constitution,"" so not delegated to the federal government, ""nor prohibited by it,"" the federal government, ""to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, ""or to the people,"" and so you could view this as reserved powers for the states."
Social Studies,"It's an Antifederalist attempt to say, ""Hey, you know, the federal government can't just ""do whatever it wants."" It's trying to put a little bit of a check on the necessary and proper clause."
Social Studies,"So if you fast-forward to the period right after the Civil War, you have the 13th Amendment, which bans slavery, and then you have the 14th Amendment, which is trying to bring slaves into society, allow them to be citizens, not just them but their descendants, and this is in direct contradiction of the 1857 Dred Scott decision that we'll talk about in other videos where the U.S."
Social Studies,"Supreme Court ruled that slaves and their descendants are not considered American citizens and so they don't have a right to petition the government, but the 14th Amendment says, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, ""and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens ""of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."
Social Studies,"""No State shall make or enforce any law,"" and so this is actually putting constraints on states, and so as we'll see, even though this is in the context of the post-Civil War era, because it's putting constraints on states, this is one of the amendments that's often cited that puts more power in the hands of the federal government."
Social Studies,"""No State shall make or enforce any law which shall ""abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens ""of the United States; nor shall any State ""deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, ""without due process of law; nor deny to any person ""within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" The 14th Amendment has been very relevant in some very current debates."
Social Studies,"This notion of that any state, no state, can deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, this is often known as the due process clause and it's this idea that no state can really strip away some of the rights that might be articulated in say The Bill of Rights, ""nor deny to any person ""within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" This is often known as the equal protection clause. This is, you could view it as a protection against some form of discrimination."
Social Studies,"And so even in very current debates around things like abortion or same-sex marriage, much of the debate will center around the 14th Amendment.."
Social Studies,"I'm not going to read it in its entirety, we'll focus on some of these powers in more detail in other videos but I will sample it and focus on some of the clauses that have been especially cited and have been especially relevant to the world that we live in. So, just to sample, so the Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, so these are very clear enumerated powers. It's listing what the Congress has the power to do."
Social Studies,"The Congress can borrow money on the credit of the United States. Once again, a very clear enumerated power. To regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes."
Social Studies,"Now, this clause right over here and this is now referred to as the Commerce Clause might not really stand out to you, it might not stand out to you relative to the right to conduct foreign affairs or something that seems very big and dramatic like that but it turns out that the Commerce Clause is viewed as one of the significant clauses that gives the federal government significant rights and it's considered to have really three enumerated rights embedded in it."
Social Studies,"You have the regulation of commerce with foreign nations, the regulation of commerce among the several states and with the Indian tribes."
Social Studies,"And it's the middle one that is viewed as giving the federal government a lot of power because even though it might seem okay, well, we're just talking about commerce between states, it's been used to justify things like federal drug laws that even if a state argues hey, we are just going to say legalize marihuana within our states, the federal government has cited that your legalization of marihuana is going to affect commerce between states and we'll go into more depth in that in future videos but the Commerce Clause is a key enumerated right that's given in the constitution that is viewed as giving the federal government fairly broad authority."
Social Studies,"But, let's continue. To establish a uniform rule of naturalization. Who becomes an American? Uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy. Keep going, I always encourage you to look at this in context in the actual constitution. That is always interesting."
Social Studies,The reason why I listed all of these out even though I'm not going to read them is that it's just interesting to see how many of these enumerated rights there are but I'm going to focus on the last clause because this one is in a lot of ways a lot bigger than all of the other ones.
Social Studies,"It says to makes all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States or in any department or officer thereof. Pause this video. Think about why this is a very, very, very big deal. Well, the previous 17 clauses were very explicit. They were enumerated powers about what the federal government has the power to do but his one here is making a much broader statement."
Social Studies,"It's saying to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, the enumerated powers that were in the last 17 clauses and so, this is known as the Necessary and Proper Clause which you will hear a lot about, Necessary and Proper and it provides for a lot of implied powers because it's essentially saying look, there's things that we haven't listed in the enumerated powers in the previous 17 clauses but the federal government has the right to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and so, even when I was talking about say federal drugs laws it's really the combination of the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause that allows the federal government to make some of these broader arguments that says okay, we regulate commerce and in order to regulate commerce we need to regulate drugs because it is necessary and proper for regulating interstate commerce, so we're gonna talk more and more about this especially when we look at specific constitutional cases that will cite these clauses but it's really important to appreciate what enumerated powers are and what implied powers are which the Necessary and Proper Clause gives a lot of and the anti-federalists really did not like this 18th clause."
Social Studies,Understanding the ideas of enumerated and implied powers is going to be really helpful as we study the various disputes over state versus federal powers throughout American history and how it is decided on by say the Supreme Court when they cite the constitution and in particular cite some of the clauses that we have just looked at..
Social Studies,"Wars are expensive. The United States, the federal government, wants to create the Second Bank of the United States. The charter for the First Bank of the United States had ended a few years ago and had not been extended. And the reason why a bank is useful for a federal government, a bank can be a place to store taxes that are collected from people. It could be a place to issue debts, to issue bank notes. Think paper currency. And so the Second Bank of the United States is created."
Social Studies,"It is headquartered in Philadelphia right over here in 1816 and then in 1817 they open up a branch in Baltimore right over there and this is where things get a little bit messy because it turns out that the Maryland legislature, Baltimore is in Maryland decides to pass a law to tax any banks that have charters from outside of Maryland."
Social Studies,"Well, it turns out that the branch of the Second Bank of the United States was the only bank in Maryland that was chartered outside of Maryland and the law itself seems to be targeted at that bank. The law taxes notes issued by the bank. The head of that branch of the Baltimore branch of the Second Bank of the United States James McCulloch, he refuses to pay this tax. He says hey, we are a federally chartered bank. You have no right to tax us."
Social Studies,"Eventually it gets appealed all the way to the United States Supreme Court. And there are two main questions that need to be answered. The first is, does the federal government have the power to charter a national bank? Where is that in the United States Constitution? By the time it got to the Supreme Court, Maryland was arguing that, hey, we don't even think that the federal government has the right to charter a bank."
Social Studies,"We don't see that enumerated in the Constitution and then if the bank can exist, can a state tax a national bank? The US Supreme Court at this time is headed by Chief Justice John Marshall, who was a federalist, and as we will see, they vote strongly in favor of the federal government. They decide unanimously that yes, the federal government does have the power to charter a bank and they say no, a state actually cannot tax it."
Social Studies,"And so, what do they cite in the Constitution to back up that decision? So this right over here is an excerpt of article one, section eight of the United States Constitution. We've covered it in other videos when we talk about enumerated powers and it lists a bunch of powers. Enumerated just means things that are very explicitly defined. They've been listed, they've been enumerated."
Social Studies,"Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, borrow money, regulate commerce with foreign nations among the several states with the Indian tribes. And it goes on and on and on, but the 18th clause here is really interesting. It's known as the necessary and proper clause and we cover it in several other videos, but it says that Congress has the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers."
Social Studies,"And so John Marshall the chief justice in his decision says look, even though the power to create a national bank, to charter a national bank, even though it isn't enumerated here in article one section eight, this clause 18, this necessary and proper clause says that look, the federal government also can make laws that allow it, that are necessary and proper for doing the other things. For example, borrowing money or issuing currency and so they're saying that look, this bank is a means to an end."
Social Studies,"And because it is a means to an enumerated end, they're saying that there is an implied power here. And so the whole notion of implied powers that we talk about in other videos, it really strongly stems from this decision on McCulloch versus Maryland. Now, Maryland argued a narrow reading of this necessary and proper clause."
Social Studies,"They're like, well is a bank absolutely necessary? Couldn't you do some of these other things without having a bank? And the Supreme Court said, well, no, no, no, this isn't to limit the federal government, that this whole section is all about enumerating powers to say what the federal government can do, not what they can't do, so does not have to be absolutely necessary."
Social Studies,"And on the second question of, well, if this bank's going to exist can the state where the branch is, can the state tax it? That's where what's known as the Supremacy Clause came in to effect. This right over here is an excerpt."
Social Studies,"Article six, clause two, this Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, the federal government, shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby."
Social Studies,"And so the argument that the justice has made is, well if you don't like something, if we allow the states to tax this national bank, well, the power to tax is the power to destroy, then you could tax it so much that it can't even operate. But this is saying that the authority of the federal government, of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land."
Social Studies,"So a state can't get in the way of the federal government and to hear it in John Marshall's own words, he wrote a very long decision about McCulloch versus Maryland, but here is just a few excerpts that speak to each of these points. So first of all, implied powers."
Social Studies,"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution are constitutional, this is a big deal. He's saying look, if the end is legitimate and if the means is not prohibited."
Social Studies,"So nowhere in the Constitution does it say that the federal government can't start a national bank, so it's not prohibited, and if the end is to do some of the enumerated powers that are legitimate, then it is constitutional. So this is really a strong wording around implied powers and using the necessary and proper clause as the backing for it."
Social Studies,"And in terms of supremacy, it is of the very essence of supremacy to remove all obstacles to its action within its own sphere, and so to modify every power vested in subordinate governments, as to exempt its own operations from their influence. So it's saying, hey, we're not going to allow subordinate governments, the states, to get in the way. That's the essence of the Supremacy Clause. This effect need not be stated in terms."
Social Studies,"It is so involved in the declaration of supremacy, so necessarily implied in it, that the expression of it could not make it more certain. So once again, John Marshall clearly saying the Supremacy Clause, in order for it to make any sense, the subordinate governments, the states, should not be able to interfere with the operations of the federal government. If their ends are legitimate, it's constitutional and the states cannot get in the way. In the example of McCulloch versus Maryland by taxing."
Social Studies,"So as you can imagine, this decision clarified the shifting of a lot of power towards the federal government and away from the states.."
Social Studies,"To learn more, I sought out the help of two experts. Randy Barnett is the Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at the Georgetown University Law Center and Director of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution. Neil Siegel is the David W. Ichel Professor of Law and Professor of Political Science at Duke Law School."
Social Studies,"So, Professor Barnett, could you kind of set the stage for us, what was happening in this case? What was the overall context? - Well, McCulloch versus Maryland was a culmination of a 30-year old constitutional controversy."
Social Studies,"In fact, it was the culmination of one of the earliest controversies that we had in the country, and that is over whether Congress had the power to establish a national bank, a bank that would be a corporation formed by Congress and which would have certain privileges that Congress granted it."
Social Studies,"This was a proposal that had been made by Alexander Hamilton when he was Secretary of the Treasury in the Washington administration in the very first year of the Washington administration, and it went to Congress, and there was a very, very robust debate in Congress as to whether this measure was within the powers of Congress to enact."
Social Studies,"Eventually, Congress voted that it was, and then before he signed the bill, President Washington asked some of his cabinet members to give him their opinion on whether it was constitutional, and he heard from several of his cabinet members. He heard from his Attorney General, Edmund Randolph, he said it was unconstitutional. He heard from his Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, Jefferson said it was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"And finally, he heard from his Secretary of Treasury, who had proposed it, Alexander Hamilton, who said it was constitutional. And Washington signed the bill and it became law. And it established the First National Bank of the United States. - [Siegel] This case arose in May of 1818 when Maryland sued McCulloch, and he was the cashier at the Baltimore branch of the bank. And Maryland sued him in state court to recover a tax assessed by Maryland on the bank."
Social Studies,"And this was a time of intense hostility towards the national bank in a number of states. The state banks competed with the national bank, and there had been an economic panic in 1818, when the U.S. bank halted its loans and state banks that had loans from the federal bank were crippled. And in response, a number of states passed nearly annhilative taxes on the federal bank, and that's the environment in which, in 1819, McCulloch against Maryland came before the Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] I find this very interesting, because this is something that we talk a lot about in the early 19th century, the Bank of the United States. And what was good about it and what was bad about it. And there are certain people who were certainly enemies of the bank, like Thomas Jefferson, and then later, Andrew Jackson. Why did people object to the Bank of the United States so much? - [Siegel] Yeah, there were a variety of objections."
Social Studies,"There was a real political policy disagreement about whether it was a good idea. Hamilton had a nation-building, economy-building objective as the first Secretary of the Treasury. He wanted to pay off both the national debt and the state debts from the Revolutionary War, which remained unpaid. He was emphasizing manufacturing and commerce and a national bank was a key part of his plan."
Social Studies,"The bank would make it easier for the national government to raise taxes, to pay off debts, to make payments, to obtain short-term loans. The notes issued by the bank could function as a national currency, it could also provide a source of capital for financing businesses. But the opponents had different ideas. - [Barnett] One of the leading opponents in Congress was James Madison, who at the time was a representative from Orange County, Virginia."
Social Studies,"And what concerned him, and I think it's what concerned many people, was no expressed enumerated power in the Constitution for Congress to make a bank. There was an enumerated power to create a post office, but there was no enumerated power to create a bank. So the question is whether the failure or the silence of the Constitution on whether there was this power should be construed in favor of having such a power, or not having such a power."
Social Studies,"And Madison's concern was that to imply such a power, especially when the way in which it was being implied was very remotely connected to one of the enumerated powers that were in the Constitution, was very dangerous because by that form of reasoning, Congress can essentially do whatever it wished, and that would violate the basic pledge that this was going to be a national government of limited and enumerated powers."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So in Congress, what was the power that proponents of the bank used to justify passing it? - [Barnett] The principle power that they used is called the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Necessary and Proper Clause says Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution its foregoing powers, those powers on the list, and all other powers vested by the Constitution in the government of the United States or any department or officer thereof."
Social Studies,"This is called the Necessary and Proper Clause. It allows for Congress to make laws incidental to the enumerated powers to effectuate, or carry into execution, those powers. And supporters of the bill said that the bank carried into execution a number of powers, it carried into execution the taxing power, it carried into execution the commerce power. The opponents of the bank said, well, it may do that, but it only does that in a very attenuated way."
Social Studies,"And therefore, if it can do this in order to effectuate that power, then it pretty much can do anything to effectuate power, and therefore it can pretty much do anything. And that's a big problem. - [Kim] So Maryland sues McCulloch, and then what happens? - [Siegel] Maryland sues McCulloch, because Maryland didn't pass the annihilative tax, it was a tax of around two percent of the banknotes issued by the National Bank."
Social Studies,"And Maryland won in the state trial court, and Maryland won in the state supreme court, and this was really not a surprise at the time, - (laughter) state courts were, let's just say, solicitous of the views of the state and after the state supreme court decided, the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court on appeal."
Social Studies,"So even though Maryland sues McCulloch, by the time it gets to the Supreme Court, it's called McCulloch against Maryland because McCulloch, the cashier at the Baltimore branch, is now the petitioner, he's requesting the U.S. Supreme Court review of the decision of the Maryland high court. And McCulloch is asking the Supreme Court to intervene and, in essence, side with the federal government over the state. - [Kim] Interesting."
Social Studies,"So what are the constitutional issues at stake once the McCulloch case gets to the Supreme Court? - [Barnett] Well, the Supreme Court in a very lengthy opinion has to consider a couple of different matters. First it has to consider whether the states have the power to tax a federal entity like a bank."
Social Studies,"And that's where you have the famous statement by John Marshall that says, ""the power to tax can be the power to destroy."" What he's talking about is the power of states to tax a federal entity like a bank, might be the power of states to destroy a federal entity, and he ruled against that claim. And he basically argued that states couldn't have that kind of power."
Social Studies,"- [Siegel] And a threshold question before the Supreme Court decides that question of state authority to tax the national government, is whether the national bank can exist to begin with. Is there federal power to create a national bank? Part of what Maryland is arguing is that there's no federal power to create the bank, and so in fact, this taxation that it's engaging in is unproblematic."
Social Studies,"The first question is whether the federal government can create the bank, and if the answer is no, then the case is over. If the answer is yes, then you get to the second question of whether the states can tax this part of the federal government, the national bank. - [Kim] So at this time, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is John Marshall, very well-known as being kind of the Chief Justice that brought the Supreme Court to be a major player in the U.S. governmental system."
Social Studies,"How did he interpret what was going on, what did he and the other justices decide? - [Siegel] He borrowed extensively from Hamilton's arguments. And so Marshall adopted Hamilton's arguments in defense of the constitutionality of the bank, that Hamilton originally articulated back in 1790, 1791. So the court held an opinion by the great Chief Justice, first, that Congress does possess the authority to create the bank and secondly, that states have no authority to tax the bank."
Social Studies,"- [Barnett] And that is what Marshall concluded was within Congress' power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact. And in fact, when it got to the court in McCulloch versus Maryland, it was the state of Maryland who basically adopted the Jeffersonian approach and said that a measure must be, in its words, indispensably requisite, or what you might call absolutely necessary in order for it to be constitutional. And whereas the defenders of the bank bill said that it could be a lot less than that."
Social Studies,"So, I think there's basically three positions that you can have. It has to be indispensably requisite, or logically necessary, that's the Jefferson and Maryland view. It could be merely a matter of convenience or expediency, meaning basically Congress can do whatever it wants. That's the liberal view that's sometimes attributed to John Marshall in McCulloch versus Maryland, but he denied it."
Social Studies,"And there's the in-between position that I think both Madison and Hamilton were favoring, and that is the requirement of some degree of means-ends fit, so that a measure really is aimed at a particular end, and it's not really trying to accomplish something that Congress isn't given the power over."
Social Studies,"- [Siegel] What I think is less well-known about this case is that this part of the case was over and the court had already decided, that this federal power to create the bank, before it even got to the Necessary and Proper Clause. This case is a great example of what's called Structural Constitutional Interpretation. Hamilton articulated two structural principles. First, that the federal government is supreme within it's sphere of action."
Social Studies,"And second, if some kind of end is within federal power, is listed in the Constitution, then any convenient or useful means to accomplishing that end is also within the scope. And so Marshall decides that drawing inferences from his understanding of the theory and structure of government created by the Constitution, and only after he does that, does he then turn to the Necessary and Proper Clause to confirm what he has already deduced through what he calls general reasoning."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, McCulloch versus Maryland is frequently paired with Marbury versus Madison as being two cases that really decide the extent of federal power in this early era. Do you think these two cases are related? What do they tell us about the ideas at this time period about federal power? - [Barnett] Well, they're very important. I don't think they are quite as extreme as they've come to be read after the New Deal."
Social Studies,"When the New Deal Court and the rest of advocates for a New Deal were going back into the past and seeking justifications for what they wanted to do, they read McCulloch versus Maryland very broadly. They also read Marbury versus Madison, actually they read Marbury versus Madison, in some respects, very narrowly because they didn't want courts invalidating their New Deal legislations. Marbury versus Madison was not a huge deal at the time it was decided."
Social Studies,The idea that judges had a duty to follow the higher law when it was in conflict with the mere statute was widely accepted at the time of the founding. And so Marbury was not announcing a new policy.
Social Studies,"McCulloch versus Maryland, on the other hand, was extremely controversial when it was decided, and in fact quite oddly, James Madison, who had signed the bill authorizing the second bank into law, greatly, strenuously objected to John Marshall's opinion in McCulloch versus Maryland upholding the bill that Madison had signed into law."
Social Studies,"So, Madison still maintained that Marshall had a latitudinarian or overly-broad interpretation of federal power even in upholding the bill that Madison, by this time, had come to believe was constitutional. - [Kim] So what ultimately happened with the Bank of the United States? - [Siegel] What ultimately happened is both the bill creating the First Bank and the Second Bank had what's called a sunset provision, which means after a certain amount of time, and it was 20 years, it expires."
Social Studies,"And so to reauthorize it, it puts the burden on inertia on those who want the thing to continue. And so Congress had to pass another bill reauthorizing the bank, and President Andrew Jackson opposed reauthorization. - [Barnett] President Andrew Jackson vetoed the reauthorization of the bank, and it was very interesting because he vetoed it on constitutional grounds, he said it was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"And yet, what happened in McCulloch versus Maryland, if McCulloch versus Maryland said the bank was constitutional, how could President Jackson say that it was unconstitutional? Well, it was interesting."
Social Studies,"Because what McCulloch said was that the bank was constitutional as an exercise of Congress' power to make laws that are necessary and proper, that Congress believed was necessary and proper, and because Congress believed it was necessary, and because the measure was plainly adapted to a legitimate end in the Constitution, then it was constitutional."
Social Studies,"What Jackson said was, hey look, the court said that it's up to Congress to decide whether something is necessary and therefore constitutional, and I as president exercise a veto power as part of the legislative process, therefore, it is up to me to decide whether the measure is necessary and therefore is constitutional, so I as president have decided that a bank is not necessary and therefore, because the bank is not necessary, it is unconstitutional, and McCulloch versus Maryland allows me as a participant in the legislative process to make that call."
Social Studies,- [Siegel] Congress did not override Jackson's veto and the bank expired and the story ended in 1836. And I think this speaks to one of many morals of the story of the Bank of the United States. The Supreme Court doesn't have the last word on Constitutional questions when it upholds exercises of federal power. It's then left to the political process to decide whether or not it wants to continue whatever controversial action or legislation was at issue.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So is there any aspect of McCulloch versus Maryland that still affects us today? - [Barnett] One reading of McCulloch is that it gives Congress a power so broad, that allows Congress to exercise any power that it deems convenient to the exercise of one of its enumerated powers, that is how McCulloch has come to be interpreted. I think that is an over-reading of McCulloch."
Social Studies,"And it also overlooks one of the key passages of McCulloch versus Maryland that nowadays is given no legal effect by the Supreme Court. This is what John Marshall said: should Congress, under the pretext of executing its powers, pass laws for the accomplishments of objects not entrusted to the government, it would become the painful duty of this tribunal, should a case requiring such a decision come before it, to say that such an act was not the law of the land."
Social Studies,"So what Marshall is saying there is that just because Congress says a law is necessary to one of its enumerated powers, doesn't make it so."
Social Studies,"And if there is a lack of fit between means and ends suggesting that in fact Congress is trying to pursue one of the powers that was not given to it under the Constitution, it really would be the painful duty of the tribunal to say it was not the law of the land, and that's what connects this case back up with Marbury versus Madison, in which it is the painful duty of the Supreme Court to say that a statute is not the law of the land if it's unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"That aspect of McCulloch versus Maryland is no longer followed in part because during the New Deal, the Supreme Court said it would not inquire into the motives of Congress in enacting laws. And in fact, what McCulloch is saying here is to inquire into the motives, it's to say, hey look, it purports to be doing one thing but it's really doing something else and that is pre-textual."
Social Studies,"- [Siegel] There has been irreconcilable disagreement on basic Constitutional questions from the very beginning of the Constitution. Madison and Hamilton, who come together and write the Federalist Papers, they disagree about this fundamental question of strict versus loose construction of Congress' enumerated powers. They also disagree about Congress' spending powers, they disagree about inherent executive power."
Social Studies,"So sometimes, originalist constitutional arguments presuppose a greater degree of consensus about what the Constitution means at the start of the country that I don't see when I study the history. We have always disagreed. We've always managed to find some kind of community in disagreement. It's the conflicts and disagreements that have binded us together as much, if not more, than the agreements we've had about what the Constitution means."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that McCulloch versus Maryland was about far more than just a tax on a bank. It bolstered the power of the federal government by broadly defining the Necessary and Proper Clause and by confirming that federal law is supreme to state law. To learn more about McCulloch versus Maryland, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"And this is significant because many of the cases we have talked about are things that broadened the power of the federal government. While the decision in United States versus Lopez, which was a split decision, it was a five-to-four decision, put some limits on federal power. And so just to understand what happened. In 1990, the U.S. Congress passes the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990."
Social Studies,"And it says, ""It shall be unlawful for any individual ""knowingly to possess a firearm at a place ""that the individual knows, or has reasonable ""cause to believe, is a school zone."" And in 1992, a high school student in San Antonio, Texas, Alfonzo Lopez, carries a concealed firearm into his high school. He is arrested, and then he is eventually prosecuted under the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, a federal law. And he is tried in a federal court. His lawyers say, ""Hey, this is unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"""The federal government does not have ""the right to regulate whether someone ""carries a gun into a school or not."" While the federal government says, ""Hey, yes we can do this because ""look at the United States Constitution. ""We, the federal government, have a right ""to regulate interstate trade."" And remember what McCullouch versus Maryland told us."
Social Studies,"From the necessary and proper clause, anything that is a means to regulate, say, another enumerated power, like the power to regulate interstate trade, that is also constitutional for the federal government. But then, you could imagine, Lopez's lawyers said, ""Hold on a second, that is a very tenuous connection."
Social Studies,"""If you're trying to connect the notion ""of firearms in schools and school safety, ""to interstate commerce, well you could connect ""almost anything to interstate commerce, ""which would mean that between the necessary ""and proper clause, the implied powers ""and the enumerated powers of regulated interstate commerce, ""well then the federal government ""could just regulate anything."" And so it eventually gets appealed all the way to the United States Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"And in a split five-to-four decision, the United States Supreme Court decides in favor of Lopez, that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, at least as it was originally written, was indeed unconstitutional, that it's an overreach of federal power."
Social Studies,"And to appreciate the majority's thinking, here's an excerpt of the decision by William Rehnquist who was the Chief Justice and who was in the majority and he wrote, ""To uphold the government's contentions here,"" the contention that the government is making that it is constitutional to regulate the possession of firearms in a school, ""we have to pile inference upon inference ""in a manner that would bid fair to convert ""congressional authority under the Commerce Clause ""to a general police power of the ""sort retained by the states."" So Rehnquist is saying, ""Hey look, if we say ""that the regulation of firearms is connected ""to interstate commerce somehow, ""because it somehow affects the economy between states."
Social Studies,"""Well then almost anything, if you layer ""pile inference upon inference, then that would ""give the right to the federal government ""to police almost anything, a type of police power ""that's generally retained by the states."" ""Admittedly, some of our prior cases have ""taken long steps down that road, ""giving great deference to congressional action."" And you could go all the way back to McCulloch versus Maryland."
Social Studies,"He's saying, ""Yeah, the Supreme Court has ruled ""many times in favor of the federal government, ""having a broad understanding of implied powers."" ""The broad language in these opinions ""has suggested the possibility of additional expansion, ""but we decline here to proceed any further."" So they're drawing the line in this decision on the expansion of congressional power."
Social Studies,"""To do so would require us to conclude ""that the Constitution's enumeration of powers ""does not presuppose something not enumerated, ""and that there never will be a distinction ""between what is truly national and what is truly local. ""This we are unwilling to do."" So he's saying, ""Hey look, if we took ""the government's side on this, there's no end."
Social Studies,"""There really isn't anything that the federal government ""can't do, and then there won't be a distinction ""between what is truly national and what is truly local."" I'll let you decide, but it's a fascinating case, and it's really important in this discussion on power between states and the federal government because this was a decision that kind of drew a line and said, ""Okay, we can't let the federal government ""have an unlimited number of powers ""based on just being able to tie inference upon inference ""to something like the Commerce Clause.""."
Social Studies,"An example of that, and this is actually something that is going on near my house right now, is that there is an intersection about two blocks from my house, so let me see if I can draw this intersection. So, looks something like this and it's a two-way stop sign, so you have a stop sign right over there."
Social Studies,"You have a stop sign right over there and the problem is you have this large park in this corner right over there and there's also a school here and so in the morning there's a lot of kids and parents going on their bicycles or walking to school, but the problem is there's also a lot of parents who might be late for school and they're going in their cars and they're going quite fast down this road and it's a two-way stop and so even though there's a lot of kids that are waiting to cross right over here, and there's no crossing guard, so there's a lot of kids and parents walking right here, they have to wait and you can imagine, this is an elementary school."
Social Studies,"These cars are going by really fast. It's quite dangerous, so the agenda here is that, well, how do you make this safer and easier for families to cross the street on the way to the park? So, the example here. How to make easier to cross the street at that intersection? Now, once you determine the problem that you want solved, you do the agenda-setting, the next step is to formulate some type of a policy, so I'll call that step two, would be policy, policy formulation."
Social Studies,"So, one potential idea here is, well, why don't we just make this into a four-way stop? So we could put some paint here to make it clear that people are going to cross on all sides and we'll put two more stop signs to make this a four-way stop and so let's say that this is our current plan as we say, hey, we're making this tangible. We're going to implement a four-way stop at that intersection. Now, that's not the only solution that's possible."
Social Studies,"Maybe some type of speed bumps might be in order right over here and right over here. Maybe they implement some type of crossing guard or maybe you put one of those flashing blinking signs that tell people their speed limits so that they go slower, so there's many different ways to formulate ideas that will address this agenda, that will address these problems, but let's say that we do a study and we decide that a four-way stop is the policy that we want to pursue."
Social Studies,"Well, then the next step after that is to convince other people that this is a good idea, so step three right over here we could call policy, policy adoption. Adoption or legitimization, and in my context, it might involve going to the city council maybe with some traffic experts, some safety experts."
Social Studies,"Maybe I could go gather the community here, petition so that a lot of people in the community here agree that a four-way stop would be in order and let's say the city council and the police department and all the various stakeholders who have to buy in say, ""Yes, we are going to implement a four-way stop here."" And then they implement it and so once the policy is adopted, the next thing is, well, you've gotta actually implement it, so I'll call that step four. Policy, policy implementation. Implementation."
Social Studies,"Mentation, and in this case, it's pretty straightforward. Someone needs to show up and install those stop signs. Maybe they're gonna put some markers over here to make it more clear that people are going to cross the street as they go on to the park, but that would be the implementation."
Social Studies,"Now, the last step in this public policy cycle or this process, and you'll see it really is a cycle, is to just assess it, to evaluate how things are going, so the next step, we'll call this step five right over here, would be policy assessment. Assessment. Or evaluation and so one possibility is to go survey people in the community."
Social Studies,"Has that solved the problem? Has it created new problems? Is there a traffic issue now because people have to go to the four-way stop? And whatever the assessment says, the assessment might say, ""Hey, everything's perfect now,"" and then you don't really have to worry about this problem anymore, but maybe there's a new traffic problem and now that'd be another issue to address and you would have to go through the cycle again or maybe it hasn't addressed the speed issue and so maybe you need to think about, well, how do we slow cars down or whatever else? And we would keep going through this public policy process or this, really this cycle that we're talking about."
Social Studies,"Now, the example that I just gave, this is a very simple example at a corner two blocks from my house and this is actually something I'm thinking about. I'm thinking about going to the city council about this, but as you can imagine, as we go into much deeper things that are affecting people at the federal level, healthcare, taxes, whatever else, each of these steps can be quite involved and it can even take years to do any one of these steps.."
Social Studies,"Article I is jam packed with information about how our government is supposed to work, but principally what it does is create the Legislative Branch of government, which includes the House of Representatives, and the Senate, which together, comprise the Congress of the United States. Article I also tells us how people can get elected to those bodies, and what powers Congress has. To learn more about Article I, I talked to two Constitutional experts."
Social Studies,"Ilya Somin is a professor of law at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, whose research focuses on Constitutional law, property law, and the study of popular political participation. Professor Heather Gerken is the Dean of Yale Law School. She's a leading expert on Constitution law and election law, and her research focuses on Federalism, diversity, and dissent."
Social Studies,"- [Dean Gerken] Article I gives an enormous amount of power to the legislative branch, otherwise known as Congress, and it was designed specifically to overcome some of the problems that they'd seen under the Articles of Confederation. - [Professor Somin] The legislative power under the Articles of Confederation was pretty weak, in part because the Congress under the Confederate articles didn't have the authority to directly tax the states."
Social Studies,"They also lacked a lot of other powers that were eventually given to Congress under the Constitution. - [Dean Gerken] These were the things that really mattered if you're building a young nation. You need to be able to do certain things in order to protect it, especially at that time, when there were many, many other countries that were circling around wanting to grab the land and power. And so the United States needed to defend itself in those early days."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Okay, so we all know today that our Legislative Branch is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. But it didn't have to be that way, so why was it that the framers settled on this two house structure for the Legislative Branch? - [Professor Somin] I think for several reasons. One is that it was a compromise between the small states and the large states."
Social Studies,"The large states, ones that have a lot of population, wanted representation in Congress in accordance with population, obviously then the large states would get more representatives."
Social Studies,"The small states, on the other hand, were concerned that they would be dominated by the large states if that happened, so in the end, the compromise is you have one house, the House of Representatives, which is largely apportioned based on population, and one house, the Senate, which is apportioned based on each state having two votes, no matter how small or how large it is. A second reason why you end up with this structure is the influence of the British example."
Social Studies,"The British had both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. And the House of Commons, of course, being more subject to popular pressure, while the House of Lords were this elite aristocracy. And the founders also wanted a combination of popular and elite power. And it was thought that the Senate would fill that elite role, in part, because initially the senators were chosen by state legislatures, rather than by the voters directly."
Social Studies,"- [Dean Gerken] So the House of Representatives, which is based on districts, is supposed to represent you based on where you live, and the Senate, which is based on states, is supposed to allow, at that time, the state legislature to nominate two luminaries from the state to represent the state. - [Kim] So yeah, for a long time, the senators were actually appointed. Now they're elected."
Social Studies,"- [Dean Gerken] Senators were appointed until the passage of the 17th Amendment, which amended Article I, and that gave state legislatures a fair amount of influence over who went to the national government. - [Professor Somin] But it is also true that many states by that time already effectively had popular election of senators. - [Kim] Really interesting."
Social Studies,"Okay, so you described the Senate as being kind of the American version of the House of Lords, a little bit more elite, a little less subject to popular opinion. How does that carry over into the Senate that we have today? How are its powers different from the House of Representatives? - [Professor Somin] It does have certainly different powers from the House in some respects."
Social Studies,"For example, it has the power to ratify treaties and to confirm appointment to the the Court and to the president's cabinet, so earlier this year when Neil Gorsuch was appointed to the Supreme Court, he had to be confirmed by the Senate."
Social Studies,"Obviously today, the Senators are elected just like members of the House are, and I think they're every bit as partisan and almost as sensitive to public opinion as members of the House of Representatives, so the difference between the Senate and the House in that regard, maybe it hasn't completely disappeared, but it's certainly greatly diminished. - [Kim] Okay so there are certain powers that are reserved to the Senate."
Social Studies,"Are there particular powers that are reserved to the House of Representatives? - [Dean Gerken] The House is important. Don't underestimate the importance of the House. I'll just say the House of Representatives, for example, is allowed to initiate impeachment proceedings against the president. - [Professor Somin] If the House votes in favor of impeachment, then the Senate holds a trial to determine whether the official in question gets convicted or not."
Social Studies,"- [Dean Gerken] As a general matter, though, they're roughly co-equal. For the big, important things, like passing legislation, you need both of them to work together. - [Kim] So together these two houses make up Congress. So how is Congress different from the Executive Branch or the Judicial Branch? What are its powers? - [Dean Gerken] The way that the framers understood it was that each one would have their own job."
Social Studies,"So the judiciary, obviously, was there to judge disputes between people, to run the court system, et cetera. The executive was there to carry out the laws. And so the executive's job is to administer the law once it has been made. And of course the legislature is there to legislate. So its main job was to make the law. And at the time, I will just tell you, everyone thought that the big gorilla in the room was Congress, that it would be by far the most powerful organization."
Social Studies,"The framers simply did not anticipate how powerful both the judiciary and the president would become over time. - [Kim] So what happens if, for example, the Congress and the president don't get along? - [Professor Somin] Well, it happens quite a lot. The president could refuse to accept laws passed by Congress, he could veto them. In that event, Congress can only override it if two-thirds of both the House and the Senate voted to do so."
Social Studies,"Congress, on the other hand, can pressure the president in various ways. They can hold hearings investigating his conduct on various issues. They can de-fund agencies of the Executive Branch whose job performance they don't like. They can refuse to confirm the president's appointees to various offices, and in extreme cases, that have happened a couple of times in our history, Congress can even impeach the president, and if he gets convicted in the Senate, then he would be removed from office."
Social Studies,"This is what led to the resignation of Richard Nixon. The House of Representatives impeached him, and Nixon resigned before he could be tried in the Senate. President Andrew Johnson and President Bill Clinton were also both impeached, and in both cases, the Senate ultimately acquitted them, but it was still a very painful time for both of those presidents. - [Kim] So speaking of antagonistic relationships, I think one thing that's really come to dominate Congress is partisanship."
Social Studies,"To what extent did the Constitution anticipate this rise of parties and partisanship? - [Professor Somin] They actually knew about parties to some degree from their British experience, but they were very suspicious of them, and they hoped and perhaps expected that they wouldn't emerge in America to anything like the same extent that they had in Britain."
Social Studies,"But in actual fact, a few years after the adoption of the Constitution, we already had the first party system, the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans, and partisan alignments have played a big role in Congress ever since then. - [Dean Gerken] So even back then there were rival interpretations of how the Constitution should be carried out, and what kind of power the national government should wield."
Social Studies,"But they somehow thought, naively, I think, that the parties would disappear and that people would have allegiances to their state or to their region, but they wouldn't have allegiance to a party. That broke down completely almost immediately after the Constitution was written."
Social Studies,"That leads to a real problem these days, because most modern Constitutions recognize that there will be two parties, that they will be in competition with one another, and that part of the job of the Constitution is to regulate that competition."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Somin] Would the founders have done anything differently if they had known about parties and expected that they would play such a big role? It's hard to know for sure, but maybe they would have been less confident than some of them were that Congress would always stand up for its prerogatives against the president when the president and Congress are of the same party. I think often Congress is inclined to overlook various presidential abuses."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] If the reverse is true, things might be very difficult to do. - [Dean Gerken] Exactly. I mean the whole point about them needing one another to act is really a problem if one side is antagonistic to the other side. - [Kim] One other thing we see here in Article I, is talking about kind of what the Federal government does versus what the states do. So this is kind of the idea of Federalism, then."
Social Studies,"Could you tell us a little bit more, just about what Federalism is and how it's supposed to work? - [Dean Gerken] So the way that we understand Federalism back then, was that there was a division of labor. The states would regulate things that were inside their territories, and accorded to them in terms of responsibility, and the Federal government would regulate everything that was accorded to it under the Constitution."
Social Studies,"The problem is, as Congress' power became more and more expansive, it ended up regulating the same areas that the states regulate. - [Kim] So if the Federal government and the states have a law on the same topic, who wins? - [Dean Gerken] As long as it's passed properly by the Federal government, then the Federal government wins. So if there's a Federal law and the state law is inconsistent with it, the state law is displaced."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Is there anything that might surprise the framers about how our Congress operates today? - [Professor Somin] When the framers created Article I and drafted it, they certainly expected that Congress would have more power under the Constitution than it did under the Articles of Confederation, but I don't think very many of them would have believed that Congress would ever be able to do things like forbid the growth of medical marijuana in your backyard, or regulate what kind of toilet you're allowed to have in your house, or for that matter, do something like the war on drugs, which forbids the possession of drugs throughout the country, and the like."
Social Studies,"Originally the power to regulate interstate commerce, which is the authority under which most of these things are done, it was at the time conceived of as a power for Congress to break down trade barriers between states and perhaps regulate the actual shipment or trading goods and services across state lines."
Social Studies,"It was not until the 20th century, particularly after the New Deal, that Congress was able to start using this as a power to regulate nearly every aspect of human life that might in some respect affect the national economy. So that, I think, is a huge change. - [Dean Gerken] I think what would really surprise the framers is how willing Congress has been to give up its own power."
Social Studies,"So Congress has given the president a lot of power, because it's created administrative agencies with vaguely defined mandates that therefore allow the president to use his entire administrative agency apparatus to pursue his goals. - [Kim] So we've learned that Article I of the Constitution establishes the Legislative Branch of the U.S. government, which is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives."
Social Studies,"These two bodies were created to balance popular power with elite power, since members of the House of Representatives were directly elected by the people, whereas senators were appointed by state legislatures. Although one major change is that senators are now elected as well, what might really surprise the framers about Congress today is how its power has evolved over time."
Social Studies,"On one hand, as Heather Gerken mentioned, the powers of the president and the Supreme Court have grown compared to the powers of Congress, but on the other hand, as Ilya Somin points out, the framers might be surprised at just how much of our lives Congress can regulate today.

Social Studies,"We're going to go into a little more depth in this video is exactly how laws get passed, in particular how do bills get passed by one or both of these houses. And if you're looking at the U.S. Capitol building from the lawn, you can assume that the Washington Monument is behind you in this picture right over here, the Senate chamber is on the left side, just like that, and the House of Representatives is on the right side."
Social Studies,"Well, what does a bill actually look like? So, right over here is the cover of a House bill, and notice some interesting things. The House bill starts with H.R., House of Representatives 1. And so this is the first bill being introduced in this first session of the 108th Congress."
Social Studies,"And it says, and it's a little hard to read, especially if you're looking at this on a mobile phone, but it says, to amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for voluntary program for prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program to modernize the Medicare program and for other purposes. So that's just a very quick summary. And then it talks about who are the representatives that are introducing the bill. So it's Mr."
Social Studies,"Hastert and then it's in parentheses, it says for himself and then it says, Mr. DeLay, Mr. Blunt, and it keeps going on and on and on. And this was introduced June 25, 2003. And over here, the bottom of where it talks about who is introducing this bill, it says, which was referred jointly to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned."
Social Studies,"So this is the first clue of how bills get started. In theory, anyone could write a bill, in practice, they are written by a member of Congress's aides or aides of a committee, and we're gonna talk more about committees. But they need to be formerly introduced by members of Congress. And you can see here Mr. Hastert, Congressman Hastert is listed first. But it doesn't go straight to a vote by the full House of Representatives."
Social Studies,"It will be introduced to an appropriate committee, which is a subset of the House of Representatives. In this case it's going to go to both the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Ways and Means Committee. We can similarly look at a Senate bill, and it has some similarities. And the key thing to appreciate is that a bill could be introduced into the House initially or into the Senate initially."
Social Studies,"And sometimes you have parallel bills that are essentially trying to do the same thing, going through both chambers at the same time. But right over here, this is a Senate bill, Senate bill 1833, this is in the 115th Congress, to modify the requirements applicable to locatable minerals on public domain land and for other purposes. And then this is September 19th, 2017. It says, Mr."
Social Studies,"Udall for himself, and then it lists other senators, introduced the following bill which was read twice and referred to the committee on Energy and Natural Resources. And then you start seeing the text of the bill. So once again, whether it initially gets introduced into the Senate or into the House, the first place where it goes is to the appropriate committee. And in general, it will only get voted on by the entire Senate or the entire House if it is approved by a committee."
Social Studies,"If a majority of the committee actually votes for it. Now what are these committees? So in the House of Representatives, you currently have over 20 committees at the time that I'm making this video. Right now you have 20 standing committees, which means they are continuously in operation, and one select committee, which means it might be created for a special purpose, although some of these select committees tend to last for awhile."
Social Studies,"Now what I'm gonna list here are some of the most powerful committees in the House of Representatives. You have the House Ways and Means Committee. Now why is this important? What is a Ways and Means? This is the committee that first considers legislation around taxation. So it's the ways and means by which the government can actually fund itself. And so you can imagine this is very, very powerful."
Social Studies,"Who gets taxed, by how much, how much revenue is actually coming in? What will that do to the economy? And this is a committee that's very specific to the House of Representatives. In general, bills could be introduced to the Senate or the House or both. But if it's something regarding taxation, that has to originate in the House of Representatives and it will go through the House Ways and Means Committee. Another very powerful committee is the Budget Committee."
Social Studies,"Through tax policy, the House Ways and Means Committee influences how the government gets its revenue, but the Budget Committee decides what is actually the budget of the government. The president can make a proposed budget, but it's the budget committee that actually decides on what budget Congress will actually vote on in the House. Now, once you have a budget, you have to think about how you're gonna spend that money. And that's what the Appropriations Committee is focused on."
Social Studies,"Which programs get how much funding? So once again, this is a very powerful committee to be on. But perhaps the most powerful committee of all is the Rules Committee. The reason why this is so powerful is that in the House of Representatives, even if a bill is introduced into committee, and even if that committee decides to vote on that bill, and let's say they pass it by a simple majority, it doesn't go straight to the floor of the House of Representatives to a vote."
Social Studies,"The Rules Committee is actually, you can view them as the traffic cop for the House of Representatives. For the most part, they decide which bills go to the floor of the House, what are the rules by which they are voted on."
Social Studies,"Are people allowed to make amendments, which are add-ons to that bill? Are people even allowed to debate it? They can even decide whether it's going to be voted on by the House of Representatives acting as the House of Representatives, or whether it's gonna be voted on as the Committee of the Whole, so to speak, which is the entire House of Representatives."
Social Studies,"The difference between voting for something as a House of Representatives or the Committee of the Whole, in either case, it would happen in the same room is that there's different procedures on how to do it. And so you can imagine there's a lot of strategy depending on which party is in charge on what initially even gets through a committee, and then once it gets through a committee, what's the procedure by which it is voted on or whether it gets voted on at all."
Social Studies,"Does it have a very public debate, or is there very little debate? Now, if something does pass the House, then that same bill, once it passes the House, would have to be voted on by the Senate. Now, similarly, in the Senate, when a bill is introduced, it goes to committee. And in the Senate currently, there are 16 standing committees and over 20 total committees at the time of this video."
Social Studies,"And just to get a sense of some of the more powerful committees on the Senate, you have things like the Appropriations Committee, which is a sister committee of the House Appropriations Committee that we talked about before. Once again, they will try to think about well, how could that money be spent? You have the Foreign Relations Committee."
Social Studies,"One key distinction between the Senate and the House, there's a lot of areas where they both might legislate on or introduce legislation on, but in general, tax bills can only originate in the House, while the Senate is closer to things like foreign relations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, all treaties would go through them. The Senate Armed Services Committee, it has legislative authority over the military."
Social Studies,"Now once something gets through any of these committees, then it would go through the Senate floor. And even there you start to appreciate a difference between the House and the Senate. In the Senate, not only do you have a fewer number of senators, they tend to be more generalists and it's easier for something to get to the Senate floor. It's a little bit more collegial."
Social Studies,"In the House, if the majority party is strongly controlling the Rules Committee, they can very strongly control not just what gets to the floor, but what is debated, how it's debated, if it's debated and what has amendments put on it. And also, the members who serve on these committees, it's a little bit more specialized. Now in either case, once a bill gets through either house, it has to be voted on by the other house."
Social Studies,"So if a bill gets approved by the Senate, then it will go to the House, and if that same bill is approved by the House with a simple majority, then it will go to the President. Now the President might sign the bill, in which case it would become law, or the President could veto that bill. If the President vetoes the bill, it goes back to both of these houses and to override the veto, each of these houses, they both have to vote with a 2/3 majority, and that happens very seldom."
Social Studies,"Now you also have a scenario where sometimes very similar bills are going through both houses at the same time. So there's a situation where a similar bill has gone through both houses at the same time, what it goes to is something called a conference committee. And a conference committee is a group of both senators and representatives who will get together and they'll try to reconcile the differences between those two bills."
Social Studies,"And once they get one bill that reconciles the differences between those two, then they'll go back for a vote to both houses. And if they pass both houses, then once again, it will go to the President who could decide to sign it or veto it, and once again, if it gets vetoed, that veto could get overridden. So the big picture here is we've talked about that policy making process in previous videos where at first you wanna identify an issue and then you wanna do policy formulation."
Social Studies,"Well, a lot of that is going on in the U.S. Congress. You have congressional aides who are identifying problems, maybe different constituents, maybe lobbyists are saying, hey, can you fix this or can you change the tax code in some way? Then they formulate a policy which is essentially these bills. These bills are essentially a policy formulation, and then those policies have to be adopted. To be adopted, it has to be approved by both houses of Congress and then signed by the President."
Social Studies,"Or if it's vetoed by the President, that veto has to be overridden by both houses of Congress. And then it's up to the Executive Branch to implement that policy. I'll leave you there. And in future videos we'll talk more about the mechanics of the U.S. Congress.."
Social Studies,"But the House of Representatives has some specific constitutional powers. So for example, impeachment proceedings would start in the House of Representatives. In other videos we have talked about impeachment is not the removal from office, of say the president, it is just a formal indictment. Now if the House of representatives is able to impeach someone, say the president, then it would go to the Senate to try the impeachment, to decide whether to actually convict the person."
Social Studies,"Now we've also talked about the House being the place where tax and revenue bills would initiate. So if we're talking about tax or revenue, these bills would start in the House of Representatives."
Social Studies,"The other areas where the Senate has more influence by the Constitution are in ratifying treaties, and this is really one of the significant levers where the Senate has more influence on foreign policy, and also confirmation of presidential appointments, either into the executive branch if we're talking about the cabinet, or judicial appointments, the federal court system including the US Supreme Court. But beyond these constitutional powers, there's differences in how these different houses are run."
Social Studies,"And what we'll see is these processes result in the Senate being more deliberative. In the video on filibuster, we talk about how hard it is to end the debate in the Senate. While in the House, the power is more centralized amongst not just the majority party, but amongst the leadership in that majority party. We're talking about folks like the Speaker of the House, and the inner circle of the Speaker of the House. And we'll see why this is in a second."
Social Studies,"And to appreciate this centralized power, and you could argue a more efficient versus deliberative process in the House of Representatives, you just have to remember that if we have a bill coming to the House, it will first go to the Speaker, who decides which committee it goes to. So let's say it goes to some type of a committee right over here."
Social Studies,"Now just as in the Senate, this committee can conduct hearings, they can have some debate, and the leadership of the committee can decide to bring it to the House floor. But in reality, what happens is is that the Rules Committee gets involved. And as we've talked about in previous videos, the Rules Committee in the House has a significant amount of power. They can decide, assuming a bill gets through committee, they can decide to what degree it is debated on the House floor."
Social Studies,"They can even decide on the rules of debating. They could decide on the House floor, is it going to be debated as the House, or is it going to be debated as the Committee of the Whole? Which happens in the House chamber, but in this situation, the House discusses it as a very, very, very large committee. And it's usually done for very important legislation, or even sometimes complex legislation where they want to pass it in a more efficient way."
Social Studies,"And so the existence of a very powerful Rules Committee, you have a Rules Committee in the Senate, but they really don't have much power. But in the House of Representatives, some would argue that they are the most important or most powerful committee, because they decide how and when things get debated. They even decide if there is a debate, or their amendments can even be added to bills."
Social Studies,"Remember, in our discussion of the Senate, once something even goes to the Senate floor, it's still open to filibuster, and you still need those 60 votes for closure on a bill. That is not the case in the House of Representatives. Now in theory, there are some mechanisms where someone could bypass some of this. So for example, in a committee in the House of Representatives, just as in the Senate, the leadership of a committee could decide to not bring something to vote."
Social Studies,"They could just put a bill into limbo, not debate it. But if someone really wants it to come to the House floor, they could use something called a discharge petition. Discharge petition. But in order to get a discharge petition, in order to make it successful so that that bill actually goes through the House floor even if the committee chairman doesn't want it to go there, it has to get a majority vote of representatives."
Social Studies,"And so you could imagine, if it's someone from a minority party trying to have a discharge petition, it would be very difficult, because how are they going to get 51% of the 435 representatives to vote for it. And so that's why in practice, this is actually not that typical. So the big picture here, beyond the constitutional powers that are given to the House or the Senate, in general, the House of Representatives is much more hierarchical. The power is centralized, especially within the majority party."
Social Studies,"And because of that centralized power, it allows the House to get bills moving much faster, especially once they go through the House floor. You don't have this notion of a filibuster, and this notion that you have to get a super majority in order to actually get a vote and get something passed.."
Social Studies,"So in terms of special influence, only the Senate, not the House of Representatives, is involved in ratifying treaties. So the executive, the president, they can negotiate a treaty but it does not become effective, binding, from a United States point of view until it is ratified by the United States Senate. And it has to be ratified by a 2/3 supermajority. And this is one of the reasons why it is viewed that the Senate has more influence on foreign relations than the House of Representatives."
Social Studies,"The other area that the Senate is involved is in confirming appointments. These could be appointments to the president's cabinet. These could also be judiciary appointments. It could be to lower federal courts, or to the United States Supreme Court. The House of Representatives once again is not involved. But to appreciate just how things go through the Senate, whether we're talking about appointments, or even if we're talking about general legislation, let's remind ourselves the overall process."
Social Studies,"So let's just say that this is a piece of legislation right over here. It could have been drafted by a staffer for a senator, maybe with help from some constituents or from some special interest groups, maybe some lobbyists, and it will be introduced to an appropriate committee by a senator or by a group of senators. For example if this legislation is about the armed services, it would go to the Armed Services Committee. Now the committee could decide to have some hearings around the legislation."
Social Studies,"Maybe they bring in the Secretary of Defense, maybe they bring in some military leaders, and ask them questions about their views about whether the legislation is a good idea or not, or they just want general context. Then they might also have some debate. And then they might decide to vote on that legislation. And if that vote passes, if they get a majority in that committee, then it will go to the Senate Floor."
Social Studies,"Now before we even talk about what happens on the floor of the Senate, because that's where things get really interesting, it's important to point out that even within committee, the leadership has a lot of influence. And the leadership is generally controlled by the majority party. Because the leadership might decide that hey you know what, they're not interested in this bill. So instead of going through this process here, they might just decide to table the bill, which kind of just puts it into a limbo."
Social Studies,"But let's talk about the reality where it does get voted on, it does get a majority, and it goes to the Senate floor. Now what's going to happen next in the Senate floor is a debate over that bill, and I'm writing debate in caps because the Senate is famous for its debates. And the whole idea of ending a debate so that you can vote is critical inside of the Senate. In order to end a debate, you need something called unanimous consent, unanimous consent, which is exactly what it sounds like."
Social Studies,"It has to be unanimous. All of the senators, all 100, have to agree, have to consent to ending the debate so that you can get to a vote. And once you get to the vote, if we're talking about a general piece of legislation, if we're talking about an appointment, then you just need a simple majority. So you just need 51 votes to pass. Now some of you might be saying wait hold on a second. I've always heard that in the Senate, in order to do anything, you need a supermajority."
Social Studies,"You might've heard the 60 vote number. The reason why you hear that is because many times the folks who do not wanna have a vote, especially if they think that the vote is going to go against them, they will decide to not consent to having a vote. And when you don't consent to having a vote, that is known as a hold. And so that one senator or it could be a group of senators that say hey I'm not giving my consent to go to a vote. I want to keep debating on it. They are placing a hold."
Social Studies,"And this protracted debate is often known as a filibuster, which is a every strange word. It was originally in reference to pirates, but it came to mean folks who were trying to hold up the legislation process. And it's become a mechanism by which the folks who don't want the vote, who might be against the bill, who might be in the minority, they might not have enough votes to defeat the bill, might still try to hold things up."
Social Studies,"Now the reason why you heard about 60 votes is because generally speaking, that is how you stop a filibuster. If you wanna stop a filibuster, you need to do something called cloture, or another way of thinking about it is closure of the debate so that you can get to a vote. And the reason why you hear 60 votes is for general legislation you need 60 votes in order to have cloture."
Social Studies,"So even though you only need 51 votes for the legislation to pass once you vote on it, to even get to that point you need 60 votes. And this is why you hear that for legislation to actually get through the Senate, you need 60 votes. Now there is an exception to this, and that exception is around appointments. Prior to 2013, in order to have cloture for an appointment, you also needed 60 votes. But in 2013 it was decided that for non-Supreme Court appointments you only needed 51 votes for cloture."
Social Studies,"And then in 2017 this was extended also to Supreme Court appointments. And so now for appointments, you only need 51 votes for cloture to end a filibuster, and so and of course you only need 51 votes for the confirmation. So functionally you just need a simple majority now in the Senate for confirmations. But legislation you need 60 votes, and of course for things like treaties you need a 2/3 supermajority. To convict someone in an impeachment, say the president, you need a 2/3 supermajority."
Social Studies,"And like the House, if we're talking about overriding a presidential veto or amending the Constitution, you need a 2/3 majority. Now what I've just talked about, it isn't extensive, it isn't exhaustive of all of the processes in the Senate, but hopefully it gives you appreciation of, one, areas where the Senate has special influence, and also how the rules and processes of the Senate can be leveraged by either the majority parties or minority parties in order to get things done."
Social Studies,"And how in the Senate because of things like unanimous consent, it is harder for a simple majority to do whatever they want.."
Social Studies,"You have individual income taxes, which you are probably familiar with. If you ever get a pay stub, and if you thought you were making, let's say, $1,000 in a pay period, you might see your paycheck is closer to $600 because there might be individual income taxes taken out, and both the federal and the state level. Then you have payroll taxes, and unless you are an employer, you might not be familiar with payroll taxes."
Social Studies,"Above and beyond your individual income taxes, your employer also pays taxes called payroll taxes. Now these are primarily to pay for things like Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and some of you are saying well don't they take that out of my individual income taxes, as well? And the answer is yes, but above and beyond what is individually paid by you, they also take payroll taxes to fund that."
Social Studies,"Corporate taxes are taxes on corporations' profits, and excise taxes, which you don't hear folks talk a lot about these days, but these are taxes on things like gasoline, or alcohol and tobacco, or airline tickets that are usually baked into those products, and those taxes can oftentimes go to the federal government. Now pause this video and see if you see any interesting trends."
Social Studies,"This visual here shows the breakdown between these four taxes for the federal government's revenue and how it's changed from 1950 all the way to 2015. Well it looks like individual income taxes, as a percent of total government revenue, has stayed roughly stable. But what you see is that payroll taxes have grown dramatically while corporate taxes have shrunk. Payroll taxes have gone from 11% of the federal government's revenue in 1950 to nearly 1/3 of the federal government's revenue in 2015."
Social Studies,"Corporate taxes have gone down from 26.5% all the way down to 10.6%, and excise taxes are a very small percentage. They used to be a significant part, but they are now a very small part of total government revenue. Now one thing to keep in mind, this visual over here just shows the breakdown. It's not showing the absolute level. If you were seeing the absolute level of government revenue you would see that grow as the nation's GDP grew as well."
Social Studies,"But in big categories, where does that revenue get spent? Well this is a similar diagram that shows the breakdown of outlays by the federal government from 1962 all the way, and these are going into projected outlays, to 2020. At the time of this video, we are right over here in 2017, and this chart was made in 2016, so it was made at around this time. But you see a couple of big categories. You first see the mandatory outlays, and in parentheses it says on autopilot."
Social Studies,"What does that mean? Well these are commitments that the federal government has already made by law to people. These are things like entitlements, like Social Security, like Medicare. And one interesting trend is these have grown in 1962 from 25% of the total federal budget, to a projected almost 2/3 of the federal budget in 2020."
Social Studies,"Now the discretionary outlays are things that, when we talk about the appropriations committees in the Senate, or the House, this is what they're debating where to spend the money. And even though it might sound something that's just nice to have, there's some pretty important things in the discretionary budget. Things like military expenditure, and as you can see, the discretionary budget has gone from over 2/3 of federal outlays, to a little under 1/4 projected in 2020."
Social Studies,"And then this top category, net interest, well the federal government has a debt, and anyone who has a debt tends to pay interest on that debt. So many people will often categorize this as a mandatory outlay as well, because we need to pay the interest on that debt, even though it's not officially a mandatory outlay."
Social Studies,"And to see how significant these entitlement programs are, and how big of an impact they have, not just on the federal government's budget, but as a percentage of GDP, we have this visual right over here. Once again, this is projecting well into the future."
Social Studies,"This chart was created in 2016, so right about here, but you can see that these mandatory outlays, as a percentage of the GDP here, so this is not just as a percentage of the budget, they are growing, and growing, and growing, and expected to keep on growing while total revenue as a percentage of GDP is expected to stay flat. And take all of this with a grain of salt. This is based on assumptions made at the time when this diagram was made."
Social Studies,"If we have varying levels of economic growth, or the tax policies change, it's possible that the total revenue as a percentage of GDP might change. Also, if there are changes to some of these entitlement programs, like Social Security, or the health care programs, or if some of the cost assumptions baked into this chart changes, well, then this diagram might change."
Social Studies,"But if you assume the data in this visual here, and the source is the White House in 2016, you see that the mandatory outlays from these entitlement programs, and the net interest, which is also essentially mandatory, these are going to take up all of the revenue that the federal government collects."
Social Studies,"And so if the federal government wants to do anything above and beyond those things, discretionary spending, and once again, some of this discretionary spending is pretty important, like the military, well, then they would have to run a deficit in those years to fund those things, or they would have to increase the total revenue. And the thing is, even once we get past this point, go into the 2040's all the way to the 2050's, it gets worse, and worse, and worse. So something has got to give here.."
Social Studies,"They get to decide how much money goes to various departments and programs in the federal government. Just for context, let's get a broad view of what the federal budget looks like and how it has changed over time. So over here you see the trend from the early 80s all the way until projected a few years into the future at the time of this video being created. And you can see the absolute level of the federal budget has gone from a little under $1 trillion and it is now approaching $4 trillion."
Social Studies,"And this view of the breakdown of the various spending areas gives us a better sense of some trends. As we mentioned in other videos, there's a significant chunk of mandatory spending. Mandatory spending are things that by law we have already obligated ourselves to. And the big ones here are Social Security and Medicare and you can see that they have gone collectively from a little over 20% of the federal budget to now approaching almost 2/3 of the federal budget."
Social Studies,"Now another chunk of this budget that we are obligated to pay is the net interest on our national debt. We are borrowers as a country and so we need to pay interest. Now everything else here you can consider to be discretionary. That would be this national defense piece right here in purple and then everything above this net interest piece. And that's what the Appropriations Committees are going to decide on, where to spend that money."
Social Studies,"How much does national defense get and how much do these other priorities for the country get? Now generally speaking, the amount of money allocated to various programs and various departments, how it is spent tends to be decided by the Executive Branch. Congress's job is to set the budget but that is not always the case. Congress can also set aside portions of this budget for specific projects. And the setting aside of parts of the budget for specific projects is known as earmarks."
Social Studies,"And to make things tangible, here are some examples of earmarks from the Highway Bill that was passed in 2005. And as you can see, it just lists a bunch of special projects and this goes on for tens and sometimes hundreds of pages. So here in California, there's a project to construct safe access to streets for bicyclists and pedestrians including crosswalks, sidewalks, and traffic calming measures in Covena, California, $400,000."
Social Studies,"If we go down here to number five, renovate and expand National Packard Museum and adjacent historic Packard facilities, and that is almost $3 million. And so one thing that's probably crossing your mind is hey, this is a national highway bill and you have these little projects that seem very, very, very local."
Social Studies,"And these earmarks here, these set asides, because they feel sometimes wasteful or they're being used more as a political tool versus something that the federal government should actually worry about, sometimes these types of earmarks are referred to as pork barrel projects, pork barrel projects. And the reason why I introduced both words are earmarks are just a general thing. You can decide whether they're good or bad."
Social Studies,"Many of those earmarks that I listed, even though they are for specific projects in specific locations, they seemed at least related to the Highway Bill, but it would be very reasonable for some folks to say why is Congress in the business of funding these specific projects? Isn't it their job to just set the budget to figure out how much the Department of Transportation gets and then let them, as part of the Executive Branch, decide how to execute on improving the national highway system or our transportation system? And so they would argue that that is pork, that those are pork barrel projects, that those are government waste."
Social Studies,"Now to get a sense of how significant earmarks and debatably pork barrel have been in the past, we have this chart from Citizens Against Government Waste and it shows earmark spending from 1991 to 2016. And you will immediately notice some things. Going from 1991 all the way until about 2006, you have this steady upward trend in earmark spending all the way to the peak in 2006 of $29 billion of earmarks. But then something interesting happens."
Social Studies,"In 2011, it looks like it gets pretty close to zero and then it starts trending up from there, but it's much lower that it was before and that's because as we get into this period after 2006, earmark spending became a very big political issue. Some of these projects, there was famously an earmark for a bridge to an island in Alaska that was going to cost several hundreds of millions of dollars."
Social Studies,"It was later canceled but it got a lot of press and a lot of politicians started to make it their mission to do away with earmark spending. Some of these pork barrel projects were easy to get people worked up about, and say, hey look, this is a sign of government waste. And so in the end of 2010, both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed resolutions to end earmark spending, although you can see that it still exists in some way, at least according to the Citizens Against Government Waste."
Social Studies,"Now at first, this seems very good because $29 billion on things like museums or maybe bridges that go to islands that very few people live on does not seem like a good idea. It seems like classic examples of government waste. But it's also important to keep it in context. Remember the federal budget is approach $4 trillion. So even in 2006, when the federal budget was a little under $3 trillion, this was only about 1% of the federal budget."
Social Studies,"And so even though earmarks, which often get called pork barrel projects, became a lightning rod for a lot of media attention because they seemed so wasteful, in most years, they represent well under 1% of the federal budget. And there are folks who would even argue that earmarks are a good thing by essentially allowing Congresspeople to set aside an earmark for something in their district."
Social Studies,"It makes it easier for bills to get passed and it's only costing us less than 1% to do it, and it's only something that's streamlining the political process. Other arguments they make is these earmarks aren't spending above and beyond the regular budget. If they do not set aside this money for these projects in these various districts or in these various states, well, then the Executive Branch is just going to decide on how to use that money."
Social Studies,"And ideally the Executive Branch would open these things up for bid, these would be competitive processes, but there's examples of the Executive Branch also favoring certain regions or certain projects. So the budget could arguably be the same whether or not there are those earmarks. It's really a question of whether it is Congress that is deciding where these special projects go or whether it is the Executive Branch."
Social Studies,"Now another term that you might often hear with the legislative process, something that helps streamline it, is the germ logrolling. Now logrolling can apply to a lot of things, not just in terms of where you spend money. Logrolling is just the idea that let's say that I am Congressperson A and you are Congressperson B, and I really like this bill right over here. I like bill number one and you like bill number two, and I agree to support you, if you agree to support me."
Social Studies,"Here I describe logrolling where we support each others bills but we could even have logrolling where we support each others parts of bills. For example, I'll support your transportation museum in your state, if you support my bicycle path in my state. So I'll leave you there. The big takeaways here are to appreciate the size of the federal budget, where it gets spent, and some of the processes used to help pass that federal budget."
Social Studies,"We also talked about earmarks which sometimes get called pork barrel projects. And it's interesting for you to think about after this video, are they good or are they bad? At first, especially when you look at the media attention, they seem clearly bad, they seem wasteful."
Social Studies,"But when you think about that they're less than 1% of the budget, and they might help streamline the passing of other important legislation, maybe making it even more bipartisan, who knows, some would argue that they might not be as bad as people first believed. You decide.."
Social Studies,"And that's to say, okay, what would my people that I'm trying to represent want me to do, and then to do exactly that. The other role is to be a trustee."
Social Studies,"And this is the idea of, well there's some issues where either the people in my district don't have an opinion or maybe if they superficially looked at it they would want to vote one way, but I, as a representative, as a trustee, I can dig a little bit deeper into the nuances and realize what's actually better for the people that I represent, or for a country as a whole."
Social Studies,"So, one way to think about it, a delegate would get a sense of the people that they represent, and what they would want, and just do that. While a trustee would say, okay what do I believe is best either for the people that I'm representing or for the country as a whole. And sometimes they obviously could coincide. And the third type of role is politico. Now, the everyday definition for politico is a politician. And sometimes it's used in the not-so-favorable sense."
Social Studies,"But in the context of, especially in a government class, a politico is a representative who does a little bit of both depending on the situation. If there's something that the people that they represent care a lot about, something that the constituents care a lot about, well there they would say, okay, you know what, I'm just gonna vote the way they want me to vote, even if I don't necessarily agree with it, because it matters to them a lot, so there I'm gonna be a delegate."
Social Studies,"But on the things that really matter to me or that don't matter so much to my constituents, well, there I'm going to be a trustee. So you could view a politico as a bit of a hybrid. So with that out of the way, let's look at some scenarios, and think about whether these are describing a representative as a delegate, a trustee, or a politico. So let's start with this first one."
Social Studies,"It says, there is a vote on a bill in the House of Representatives that would increase environmental regulations on major businesses. Several citizens in Illinois' 9th congressional district have contacted their representative to influence him to vote in favor of the bill. However, Representative Wallin thinks that these regulations will cost businesses too much money, which will lead businesses to firing his constituents, so he decides to vote against it."
Social Studies,"So pause this video, and so, is Representative Way-lin, or Wall-in, acting as a delegate, a trustee, or a politico? So the key clues here are, that Representative Way-lin, or Wall-in, decides to vote against the bill despite the fact that some of his constituents have contacted him to vote in favor of the bill. And so here is clearly acting based on his own beliefs, so he is acting as a trustee. He's doing what he thinks is best for his constituents, even though they might not agree with him."
Social Studies,"Let's look at another scenario. In the Senate, there is a vote on a bill that would eliminate the penny. Citizens in Indiana reach out to their Senator to encourage her to support the bill. Even though Senator Portela thinks the penny is incredibly useful, she decides to vote for the bill. So pause this video, think about how is Senator Portela acting? As a delegate, trustee, or politico? Well, it's pretty clear that she's doing exactly what her constituents want her to do."
Social Studies,"The constituents are encouraging her to support the bill and she votes the bill. And she's doing this despite what she thinks is the better option. Even though she likes the penny, she's going to vote to eliminate the penny because that's what her constituents want. So she is clearly acting as a delegate. And to be clear, and this is often the case, many times the representative will agree with their constituents and then in that situation they're acting as both a delegate and a trustee."
Social Studies,"Now let's look at one more scenario. There are two major bills up for a vote in the Indiana state senate. One bill will change the name of a high school in Indianapolis to Larry Bird High School. The other bill would set aside 100-acres for a new state park. Senator Kamath has received about 1200 calls from her constituents asking her to support the bill to rename the high school, but no calls about the park bill."
Social Studies,"Senator Kamath is incredibly passionate about parks, but has not decided her vote on the renaming of the high school. Senator Kamath decides to vote in favor of the park bill, using her better judgement to decide her vote, and in favor of changing the name of the high school to represent her constituents' interests."
Social Studies,"So you, once again, should pause this video, and figure out is Senator Kamath acting as a delegate, trustee, or politico? Well, you can see on the park bill, which she supports, so she votes in favor of the park bill. She does that because that's just what she thinks is better, she's using her better judgement. So in that scenario she's acting as a trustee. She's doing what she thinks is right."
Social Studies,"And then on the naming the high school Larry Bird High School, there she just says, hey, you know what, I don't have a strong opinion of it, I am just going to represent my constituents interests. And so there she's clearly acting as a delegate."
Social Studies,"And so the scenario where sometimes you act as a delegate, sometimes you act as a trustee, this is sometimes categorized, or often categorized, especially in a government class, as a politico, which as I mentioned before is really just a term often used for a politician. And you can imagine it's very natural for a politician to sometimes act as a delegate, hey I've got to make my constituents happy, let me do exactly what they want me to do."
Social Studies,"But every now and then my constituents either might not care about an issue, or they might not realize all of the details or all of the implecations, and so I might do something that's maybe not exactly what they want. And in those scenarios, well then I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna vote my conscience. And if I do a little bit of both, on different types of issues, well then I'm acting as a politico.."
Social Studies,"And on this right map we see the congressional districts in and around Chicago, Illinois. What I'd like you to do is pause this video and see if you see anything interesting about the shapes of these congressional districts. Well some things might immediately jump out at you. Here in Chicago, Illinois, this fourth district in particular seems kind of fishy. It's often known as the earmuff district."
Social Studies,"It has this northern part and this southern part, and then it's actually connected just by an interstate, not by the things on either side of that interstate. So that doesn't seem like a natural shape for a congressional district. And then here in Austin, Texas, you see that the votes in Travis County are split amongst many congressional districts."
Social Studies,"And so the question that should be surfacing in your brain is, why are these districts shaped that way? And the answer that many people will give you is it's because of a gerrymandering. Gerrymandering, which is the idea of shaping districts to benefit one political party or another. Every 10 years there's a U.S. Census, and based on that census, different states will might get a few more representatives or a few less representatives, and so state legislatures will often have to redistrict."
Social Studies,"And so that's when this occurs. And so the first question you might ask is, well that's a very strange word, where does it come from? And that goes all the way back to 1812 when the then governor of Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry, Gerry was how you pronounced his name although now it's gerrymandering. He decided to sign the bill that would reapportion the state senate districts. And you have this one really strangely shaped district right over here that people said hey that looks like a salamander."
Social Studies,"And so they created a portmanteau which is really just a combination of words around Elbridge Gerry and the back half of salamander. So you have gerrymander, which is creating these districts to advantage one party or the other. Elbridge Gerry did it for the Democratic Republican party against the Federalist, but now it's Republicans versus Democrats."
Social Studies,"So now let's go back to the two districts that we looked at and think about what are the implications of it? Who will, who does the gerrymandering benefit? So in the case of Austin, Texas, Austin, Texas is an urban area. Urban areas tend to lean more left. And it does lean more Democratic. It's actually more liberal than most urban areas in Texas. But it's surrounded by more rural areas that lean right."
Social Studies,"And so it would be advantageous and it is advantageous for Republicans to split those Democratic votes amongst these Republican districts. In the case of Chicago, it's a little bit less obvious. This type of gerrymandering was done by a Democratic legislature, but it's a little bit less obvious what's going on here with the fourth district because it is actually surrounded by districts represented by Democrats."
Social Studies,What you need to appreciate is when this gerrymandering is done it's often done by sophisticated computer algorithms and there's all sorts of implications of stretching one district or another. This is just one tactic that you see here is taking a bunch of Democratic votes and diluting them amongst a bunch of Republican districts. You might see it the other way.
Social Studies,You could have situations where you redistrict so that an incumbent no longer lives in their district and so they wouldn't be the incumbent anymore. You might see redistricting to force two incumbents to go against each other. You might see redistricting where you're collecting pockets from certain constituencies so that you can make a district so that they would have representation and that's the one that's often cited for the district four right over here.
Social Studies,"Because these are heavily Hispanic areas around or in Chicago. Now I'll leave you with a newspaper article from the Salem Gazette in 1813 that talks about at least how the Federalists felt about that first official gerrymandering. This is in response to Elbridge Gerry's signing of the bill to allow for that salamander shaped district that advantaged the Democratic Republicans against the Federalists. Federalists, followers of Washington."
Social Studies,"Again behold and shudder at the exhibition of this terrific dragon, brought forth to swallow and devour your liberties and equal rights. You can see in the picture it actually does look like a dragon, they put wings on it. Unholy party spirit and inordinate love of power gave it birth. Your patriotism and hatred of tyranny must by one vigorous struggle strangle it in its infancy."
Social Studies,The iniquitous law which cut up and severed this Commonwealth into districts is kindred to the arbitrary deeds of Napoleon when he partitioned the territories of innocent nations to suit his sovereign will. You gotta remember this is right around the time of Napoleon conquering much of Europe. This law inflicted a grievous wound on the Constitution.
Social Studies,"It in fact subverts and changes our form of government, which ceases to be Republican as long as an aristocratic House of Lords under the form of a Senate tyrannizes over the people and silences and stifles the voice of the majority."
Social Studies,"And then it goes on to say, will you then permit a party to disfranchise the people, to convert the Senate chamber into a fortress in which ambitious office-seekers may entrench themselves and set at defiance the frowns of the people? No, this usurping faction must be dislodged from its stronghold.."
Social Studies,"Baker versus Carr grappled with an incredibly important issue. Whether one person's vote is equal to another person's vote. That seems pretty straight forward to us now, but as we'll learn in this video, before Baker versus Carr, it wasn't always the case. To learn more, I talked with two experts. Theodore Olson is a partner at the law firm of Gibson Dunn, and served as solicitor general of the United States from 2001 to 2004."
Social Studies,"Charles is the Edward Ellen Schwarzman professor of law and the founding director of the Duke Law Center on law, race, and politics. Mr. Olson, could you kind of set the stage for us. What was the overall historical and political context that led up to the issues of Baker versus Carr. - [Olson] Well, it is a very, very important decision. Earl Warrent who was chief justice at the time the case was decided later said that it was one of the most important decisions of his tenure as chief justice."
Social Studies,"Prior to the decision in Baker versus Carr, and a couple of subsequent decisions, legislatures throughout the country were organized in a way based upon geography and other considerations rather than population. We take the phrase one person, one vote for granted now."
Social Studies,"But prior to that time, rural counties particularly, all over the United States, dominated state legislators and individuals in cities, particularly, might be electing one representative when a rural county or a rural geographical area, much smaller in terms of population, would also have the same amount of votes."
Social Studies,"So there was a disproportionate weight to smaller communities based upon population, which had very significant political consequences with respect to allocation of money and resources and the like. - [Charles] So in the US we draw lines as a way of aggregating voters together so that way we can elect people to various representative bodies. So the process of doing so, drawing the lines, is called, depending on when it's done, reapportionment or redistricting or districting."
Social Studies,"So we draw lines through districts for the purposes of representation. And that has been the practice in the US for basically time immemorial, but the way of districting for the purpose of representation. Well, many states, especially in the late 19th century to early 20th century, refused. They drew the lines, in the case of Tennessee, they drew the line in 1901."
Social Studies,"That was the last time they reapportioned where they counted the number of voters in the state and then they decided how many voters were going to be in each particular district. So a lot of time has passed from 1901 to when the case was decided in 1961, and many people moved from the rural areas to the urban areas, or from the rural areas to the suburbs, and the districts were just not equal. There weren't the same number of voters in each particular district."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this case took place originally in Tennessee and was brought by a man named Charles Baker. So who was Charles Baker and why did he object to how districting was done in Tennessee? - [Olson] Well he was among a group of citizens in a way, like many other supreme court cases, it's an accident that his name is the one by which we remember the case."
Social Studies,"So he came together, along with some lawyers and other citizens in this Tennessee area, and brought the case because of they listed the participants as plaintiffs alphabetically, Mr. Baker was the first one on the list and he became the plaintiff. There were a group of citizens in Tennessee, he was on the board of judicial body in Tennessee, but he was among several citizens who objected to the way the state legislature was apportioned. - [Instructor] Suppose that we have a class term."
Social Studies,"I'd say we have an AP history class and we're deciding I want to take the class out to dinner and we're making two decisions, a seafood place or a steak place. Let's suppose that we have 10 people in the class and we have three districts, all right. So we're gonna make it when the basis of the decision of those three districts. Okay, so we've got one district of two people who like seafood, another district of two others who like seafood, and a district of six people who like steak, all right."
Social Studies,"But we're gonna decide on the basis of the votes of each of the districts and the outcome, the majority of the votes in the district will decide the outcome. So remember the first district had two people and both of those people like seafood. Our second district also had two people, and both of those like seafood. And our third district had six people, and those six like steak."
Social Studies,"Now, on the basis of the decision of the district, right, so each district counts for one vote, seafood wins two to one, all right. But, if you look at the total number of people and the total preferences, there are actually six people who like steak and four people who like seafood. So really, the decision should be in favor of steak as the majority of the people or the voters in that classroom preferred steak over seafood."
Social Studies,"But we can rejigger that outcome by just dividing the people into districts and dividing them into unequal districts, and then saying each district gets one vote. Well, for all intents and purposes, this is exactly what Tennessee had done. They basically divided the state into districts so that way, and elect representatives from that district."
Social Studies,"But some districts only had let's say 100 people, and others had 1,000 people, and some had 400, some had 10,000, I'm making up the numbers here, but just to give you an example of what the disparities were like. But each counted essentially as one. Each district had one vote, even though they weren't equal in the number of people that were in the district. When a student comes to me and says, well, wait a minute, there are many more people who prefer steak, it's a majority."
Social Studies,"I'm not going to change the system because the system reflects my preferences and it was the same thing in Tennessee. The state legislature did not have the incentive to change the system because if they did they would lose their seats. - [Kim] So it's pretty quirky. This is of course, the supreme court is turning to the Constitution for its interpretation."
Social Studies,"So what does the Constitution say about apportioning representatives? Does it make any mention of how districts are supposed the be drawn? - [Olson] It does not. It's very interesting that our Constitution, as everyone knows, gives two senators for each state and then apportions the house of representatives by district, which is required to be redetermined every 10 years after the census."
Social Studies,"But, prior to Baker versus Carr, there was very little regard to the fact that some districts were more populous than other districts, which meant that an individual voter in a populous district, who had the same amount, had a vote, that was diluted in a sense that he shared that vote, or that weight of his vote with many more persons. And this was rampant all over the United States."
Social Studies,"In California, Los Angeles County had, which was 40 percent of the population of the state of California, had one representative because it was a county and it had lots of people in it. And then there were three smaller counties who had very, very few people, maybe had 10 or 15,000 people in the county, and they each had one vote as well."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So Charles Baker takes this case to the courts, and then what happens? How does this case make its way through the courts? - [Charles] Well, the one thing to think about, the reason why Baker versus Carr is such an important case, we have to remember that the federal courts and particulars through the United States Supreme Court had said in a case called Colegrove versus Green, look, we, the federal courts, are not going to involve ourselves in any of these redistricting type cases."
Social Studies,"We don't wanna have anything to do with them. We don't believe we have the power to hear them, so in '46, the court said we don't have the power to hear these cases and no matter what happens, those are cases that belong to the political process. Those are not cases that belong in the federal courts. And large part, an important part because we don't think the constitution has anything to say about those cases."
Social Studies,"- [Olson] So when it got to the supreme court again in Baker versus Carr, the question was whether the court would reverse that earlier decision and decide this is something that we, as a court, can deal with as opposed to something that must remain in the political realm. And the case was argued twice, in April of 1961 and again in October of 1961."
Social Studies,"The court set it for rearguement because the first time it was argued, one of the justices was undecided and they were divided four to four and they decided to set it for reargument again. And when the case was then decided after the second argument, the court ruled six to two. One of the justices became disabled at the end of the deliberation, so it was only eight rather than nine."
Social Studies,"But they decided six to two the narrow, relatively narrow question, not one person one vote, but the narrow question is this something that the Constitution gives us permission to decide."
Social Studies,"And reciting the 14th amendment to the Constitution which contains the well known due process and equal protection clause, the court and Baker versus Carr decided we can look at the Constitution to discern from the equal protection clause that there is, and due process clause, but mostly the equal protection clause, there is a basis for us to decide that it might violate an individuals constitutional right to equal protection of the laws."
Social Studies,"If they're placed in a political situation where their vote counts less than someone else's vote. - [Charles] And so that's the way that the court got around that question. And the technical legal term is to say that these cases are justiciable, which means that the courts can hear them, that the federal courts have the power to decide these types of cases. Now, the court did not decide the second question in Baker versus Carr, which is okay."
Social Studies,"Suppose that it's true, right, which if the court says it's so, it is now true, that federal courts do have the power to make those decisions, how do we determine what is the standard that we're going to use to determine whether the constitution is violated? And that question the court put off to the side. The court said something to the effect that look, we know that there are standards, they are available."
Social Studies,"What we're deciding now is that we have the power because the equal protection clause, in fact, means that the state can't draw lines that are so malapportioned that they undermine the equality of voters. - [Kim] Baker versus Carr says that the courts then can rule on redistricting. Did this bring in a flood of cases about redistricting? - [Olson] It did."
Social Studies,"Once the court decided that this was fair game, that this was appropriate for courts to consider whether or not disparities in voting power as a result of packing people into different districts in different ways constituted a violation of the Constitution, then in a relatively short term by supreme court standards in 1963 and 1964 and other decisions that all came about before the end of the '60's."
Social Studies,"The court pronounced in case after case that one person, one vote did indeed have to, was required by the Constitution. So, Baker versus Carr opened the door for a stream of decisions from the supreme court that put into our constitutional fabric the concept of one person one vote. Which changed probably more than anything, the structure of our political government in the United States."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Do you think that our election system today conforms to this standard of one person one vote? - [Olson] Well, we probably haven't solved all of the problems, but compared to where we were in 1961 before Baker versus Carr, we've really crossed that rubicon. Most districts are relatively equal. There is a census every 10 years so that we can count the number of persons in districts."
Social Studies,"There's still cases that come along, there are cases involving the allocation of persons by race and whether there are systems in place that discriminate on the basis of race. - [Charles] Some states have passed laws requiring voters to present photo identification when the voter goes to vote at the polling place. And one objection to the photo ID is that it's a violation of the equal protection clause."
Social Studies,"It's a violation of the idea of of equality that voters are not being treated equally via 71 and other because some voters have voter ID's and others have a hard time getting them for whatever reason. And there are some, there might be racial disproportionate effects, might be class effects, there might be gender effects."
Social Studies,"So this raises a violation of the equal protection clause and these are the types of arguments that are now available to someone challenging the problem of inequality in voting pose after Baker v. Carr that were not available before that Baker versus Carr. And to fully answer your question, some people might be say look, we don't fully have one person one vote because we have a lot of laws that treat voters unequally."
Social Studies,"- [Olson] If the political party A, controls both houses of a legislature in a particular state and the person who's in the governors mansion, then those lines can be drawn to favor that political party. So that you might have situations where a political party maybe only has 40 percent of the registered voters in a particular state, but maybe 55 percent of the elected representatives. That's called political gerrymandering. And those issues have come before the court."
Social Studies,"- [Charles] We still haven't achieved the type of equality that was promised by the Baker line of cases. - [Kim] So we've learned that in Baker versus Carr the supreme court ruled that redistricting was a justiciable issue, or something that the federal courts could decide because ensuring that votes have equal weight is important to ensuring equal protection under the law."
Social Studies,"The standard of one person, one vote opened the flood gate for cases about equality of representation in districting which are still being litigated at the supreme court today. To learn more about Baker versus Carr, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"But then when you get to Richard Nixon, you have one party, the Republicans, controlling the White House, while the other party, the Democrats, controlled Congress. And so this situation right over here is known as a divided, divided government. And as we look down this diagram, we see that it is not that unusual. Gerald Ford had a divided government."
Social Studies,"Ronald Reagan had a somewhat divided government where the House significantly leaned towards the Democrats, although the Senate started to lean a little bit towards the Republicans. But then if we go further down in time, we see more and more divided governments. So if we go all the way down to at least the present when this video was created, we see that George H. W. Bush faced a divided government. He was a Republican. You had the House and the Senate lean towards the Democrats."
Social Studies,"Bill Clinton, at the beginning it wasn't divided, but most of his administration, he had a divided government. George W. Bush had a divided government near the end of his administration. And Obama dealt with a divided government during the second 1/2 of his first term, and his second term."
Social Studies,"One question is why does it matter if you have a divided government like we had, let's say, in this time period right over here? Well, one negative of it that some people will often cite is that you might have some form of extreme partisanship. And partisanship is just a word that says that the various political actors will think more about their party and their political ideology than maybe what is in their best interest for the people."
Social Studies,"Or they would try do things in order to get political points as opposed to just good governance. And one byproduct of partisanship would be a phenomenon known as gridlock. You might've heard the word gridlock before when it comes to traffic. Gridlock is when there's just so much traffic that nothing is moving, that people just can't get around. And it essentially means the same thing in a political context."
Social Studies,"If you have a divided government, and one party isn't allowing, if everything that the Congress passes the president vetoes, or if everything that the president wants to do the Congress doesn't wanna work along with him, well, then nothing might happen, and you might get to a gridlock situation. And for a lot of people, that's a significant negative. But there are some viewpoints that maybe a divided government isn't as bad as it sometimes looks."
Social Studies,"Some people would argue that you don't want the government always doing exactly what they want when you have a non-divided government. In fact, if you have a divided government, they'll only do things that really, really, really, really matter where there is more of a broad consensus. There's also this view from Mitch McConnell, who's the current leader of the US Senate, that it's actually easier to get things done during a divided government."
Social Studies,"This is a part of an article from the New York Times written in 2011. It says, ""Divided government is the perfect time ""to do big things, the perfect time,"" Mr. McConnell said in a recent session with New York Times reporters and editors. He cited three fairly recent examples of major legislative bargains that were struck with one party in the White House and another running things on Capitol Hill, the 1983 overhaul of Social Security negotiated between President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill."
Social Studies,"Ronald Reagan was, of course, Republican, and Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, was a Democrat. Sweeping 1986 tax law changes. Once again, under Ronald Reagan. And the welfare reform package of 1996 negotiated between President Bill Clinton and Congressional Republicans. Clinton, of course, was a Democrat. ""None of those things in my view ""would have occurred in unified government,"" Mr. McConnell said, referring to control of Congress and the White House by one party."
Social Studies,"""The differences are always big, ""but if you can bridge the differences, ""then you can survive."" The beauty of divided government, very few people say that, the beauty (laughs) of divided government, in the eyes of Mr. McConnell is that it provides both parties with near bulletproof political cover since neither can attack the other after legislation is passed, while it also gives both parties the ability to take political credit. So I'll leave you there. I want you to think about it."
Social Studies,"Do you agree with Senator McConnell that divided government can actually be a good thing? Or do you think this notion of divided government and partisanship does lead to gridlock, and for the most part it is a bad thing? And then we could also think about our system of government, because our system of government definitely allows for things like gridlock to occur, while many other systems like a parliamentary system, you always have the majority or a ruling coalition party also in charge of the executive, so you're not likely to have this type of gridlock."
Social Studies,So think about it. Which system do you like? And is a divided government a good or a bad thing?.
Social Studies,"After all, the Founders had just rebelled against a monarchy where power was placed in the hands of one individual. They'd been so nervous about executive power that the first governmental system of the United States, the Articles of Confederation, didn't have an executive branch at all. So to learn more about Article Two I sought out the help of some experts."
Social Studies,"Professor Sai Prakash is an expert in the separation of powers, particularly executive powers and teaches constitutional law, foreign relations law, and presidential powers at the University of Virginia School of Law. For more on the debate about what an executive branch should look like, I talked to Professor Michael Gerhardt. He's a leading constitutional scholar whose specialties include civil rights, civil liberties, and separation of powers."
Social Studies,"So Professor Prakash, why did the framers choose to invest power in a president? Were there any other options for an executive branch? - [Professor Prakash] They thought about creating an executive council, which would have been composed of three or more executives that would have jointly exercised whatever executive power they vested in the executive. And so you might have had a triumvirate like they had in Rome, or an executive council like they had in some states."
Social Studies,"And they also thought about doing something slightly different, which is to have a single president, but then require the president to go to a separate executive council before he made several important decisions but in the end they decided we like to concentrate executive authority in the hands of one person thinking that that would be better for law execution, better for assigning responsibility, would bring energy to the executive branch and the executive branch wouldn't be riven with dissent and dissension."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] I asked Professor Gerhardt how long it took the framers to decide on the form the executive branch would take. - [Professor Gerhardt] It was something on which the framers came to an agreement pretty quickly. They came into Philadelphia and almost at the very outset there was a proposal that came forward from Virginia, part of the Virginia Plan, and the Virginia Plan proposed a single executive who would serve for seven years and not be eligible for reelection."
Social Studies,"The delegates would eventually agree on certain features which are now encapsulated or can be found in Article Two. - [Kim] I think one of the tensions we see in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is trying to create a structure for government that's strong enough to do what it needs to do, but also one that doesn't have too much power so that it doesn't become a tyranny as the framers had seen in Europe."
Social Studies,"So were they nervous about having an executive branch in the first place? - [Professor Prakash] That's a great question, Kim. You know, we had a confederation before the Constitution. It was called the Articles of Confederation and in that system we had Congress acting as a plural executive."
Social Studies,"And Congress and the observers of Congress thought that Congress wasn't really well suited to playing the role of executive, to supervising foreign affairs, and to supervising executive officers both military and civilian. And so by the eve of the Philadelphia Convention where they wrote the Constitution there were quite a few people saying we need to have a separate executive."
Social Studies,"We need to invigorate it with authority because if we do that we will then have a successful new government under the new Constitution. - [Professor Gerhardt] Alexander Hamilton, for example, wanted an executive who would basically serve for life. He didn't get it. You can imagine that for many delegates an executive who could serve for life would sound an awful lot like a king, and that's exactly what they had just rebelled against."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] Other people said if you create a unitary executive, if you create this single executive, chief executive you're gonna have a monarchy."
Social Studies,"You're gonna have someone who is intent upon seizing powers of various sorts, who's going to want to install maybe a hereditary monarchy somehow and that was the tension between those who wanted to have a stronger executive, a stronger single executive thinking that that would be the best thing for the government and those who thought that a single executive would descend into a monarchy."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So I imagine it was pretty tricky for the Framers to think how they could have an executive branch that was powerful enough to get things done, but not so powerful that it took on that tyrannical cast that they were really eager to avoid. So what powers did the president eventually end up having? - [Professor Prakash] You know, the president is made commander in chief of the army and the navy. He has the power to pardon."
Social Studies,- [Professor Gerhardt] The president has the authority to nominate people to certain high-ranking offices subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. Among those offices are included Supreme Court justices. The president has the authority to be able to negotiate treaties.
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] So he's got a host of authorities, and then there's the central question that's disputed, Kim, which is does the first sentence of Article Two, which says the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States, does that also give the president any authority beyond what's listed in Article Two sections two and three? So for instance, does the Vesting Clause of Article Two give the president authority over law execution? Is he able to direct the execution of federal laws by subordinate executive officers? Does the president have the power to remove executive officers by virtue of the Vesting Clause? And then significantly, does he have foreign affairs authorities by virtue of the Vesting Clause to speak to other nations to direct US ambassadors, etc? And that's a dispute that's been ongoing for 200 years whether the Vesting Clause really grants additional authorities to the president."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Gerhardt] So all those different powers we now more or less take for granted that are common to US presidents are all set forth, for the most part, expressed in the Constitution. There are a few implicit powers the president will take on over time. - [Kim] As I understand it, the president's powers have grown fairly significantly over time."
Social Studies,"Do you think the Framers would be surprised by how much power the president has today? - [Professor Gerhardt] Yes, it's grown, I think to be perhaps more powerful than many of the Framers initially thought it might be. There were some authorities, for example, the power to remove people in the executive branch that are not spelled out explicitly in the Constitution."
Social Studies,"Over time, the presidency would acquire that power and ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States would ratify that, or affirm that authority. That's one big area, removal power, over executive branch officials that gets clarified and sharpened over time."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] Over time the president has cited, president and his assistants have cited the Vesting Clause as a source of a great amount of authority and some of those claims you might think are consistent with the Constitution and others you might think are inconsistent. So what are the things that presidents have claimed? They've claimed the authority to direct the execution of federal statutes. I think that's consistent with the original design."
Social Studies,"They've claimed some limited authority over foreign affairs. I think that, too, is consistent with the original design. They've also claimed authority to exercise certain powers in emergencies, that's more contested and more debatable whether they have some sort of emergency power either temporary or otherwise."
Social Studies,- [Professor Gerhardt] When Abraham Lincoln comes into power Congress is not in session and Lincoln's gotta respond in real time to an invasion on federal territory and to try to begin the protection of the United States and he does that initially without Congress being a part of it because he has to move very quickly.
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] They've also claimed the authority to wage war and that's also contested because of course Congress has the power to declare war and many people believe that that text means that Congress gets to decide whether to wage war. Modern presidents take the position, or often take the position that they can use military force overseas without getting a declaration of war or more precisely, without getting congressional approval for the use of force overseas."
Social Studies,"So yes, the president's powers have changed over time and that's a source of deep controversy. - [Kim] So what checks can the executive branch use on the legislative or judicial branches of government? - [Professor Prakash] Kim, the executive has a veto. And the veto permits the president to reject legislation sent to his desk by Congress."
Social Studies,"So under the Constitution, congress has to present all legislation to the president and he can either sign it and thereby make it law, or he can veto it, and if he vetoes it and he sends back his objections to Congress they then have the option of overriding the veto by a two-thirds vote in both chambers."
Social Studies,"And so the veto gives the president great leverage over Congress 'cause they know that if he vehemently opposes a particular piece of legislation they can only pass it if there are rather sizable supermajorities in both chambers. - [Professor Gerhardt] He has a power to be able to pardon people for federal offenses. So again, that's a unique presidential authority."
Social Studies,"The presidency, in a sense, is taking more of the limelight away from Congress, which might be making the law, but administering the law is gonna require a lot more time and put the president in the position of also exercising discretion over how to enforce the law."
Social Studies,"So that becomes another important authority of the presidency, how do you go about enforcing it? What kind of discretion do you have when you do enforce it? - [Professor Prakash] He also has the power to recommend measures to them under the Constitution. That is to say he can suggest that they pass legislation on a particular subject thereby making sort of a vague suggestion, or he can actually present them a bill and say I'd like you to consider this."
Social Studies,"They don't have to act on the bill, but he has that authority. And you know, he can also tell them about the state of the union, right? That's the State of the Union Clause. So those are the checks he sort of has on Congress and those are significant checks. The members of Congress don't get paid unless the president signs the bill that passes the appropriation for them or they override his veto. So those are significant checks."
Social Studies,"And then with respect to the judiciary, Kim, there aren't as many checks in the Constitution. The Constitution never says the executive branch has to execute judgements issued by the courts, but that's been our practice, and I think it's an implicit feature of the Constitution that when courts issue judgements the executive will honor them and enforce them."
Social Studies,"Because that's an implicit feature of the Constitution presidents don't really have much leverage over the courts, right, because the president does get to nominate then and goes get to appoint them and that gives him some sort of say over who becomes a judge, but once they're judges he doesn't have any say over what they decide and he typically, as I said, enforces their judgment. So the check on the judiciary is, who gets into the federal courts, who gets to serve as a federal judge."
Social Studies,"Once they're judges the president doesn't have the same kind of check that he has on Congress. There's no veto on judicial decisions, for instance. - [Professor Gerhardt] The president can unilaterally or on his own issue what are called executive orders, which are essentially mandates that govern the operations within the executive branch. One president can set the priorities one way, but another president can reshape them a different way."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, 'cause executive orders can do very positive things like Truman's executive order that the armed services be integrated, but they can also do very negative things, for example, interning Japanese Americans during World War Two. - [Professor Gerhardt] That is correct. And so the executive orders oftentimes might reflect a particular president's values, but it can also particular president's priorities."
Social Studies,"The challenge with an executive order is that it only lasts longer than a particular president's term if other presidents are willing to sign off on them as well. And so for example, you can see how President Trump has decided not to continue certain executive orders that President Obama put into place just as President Obama chose not to extend certain executive orders President George W. Bush put into place. - [Professor Prakash] Lots of rules and laws are not made by Congress in the modern era."
Social Studies,"They're made by executive and independent agencies and so a lot of the rules that we have to follow about the environment or about labor or about securities, they come from agencies and not directly from Congress. And when the agency is an executive agency, the president not only appoints the people that run that agency, the president or his assistants in the White House are often involved in crafting the rules and shaping the rules in various ways."
Social Studies,"And so if we think the mass of rules and legislation comes from the government, the executive and not the Congress, then the president has a great role in that. - [Kim] So our first president was George Washington. In what ways did Washington set important precedents that are still with us today? - [Professor Gerhardt] There are a lot of people, a lot of scholars who think that things would've been quite different had it not been Washington."
Social Studies,And the fact that George Washington would become the first president helped put a lot of people at ease because he was widely viewed as trustworthy and somebody who wouldn't be naturally disposed to become tyrannical.
Social Studies,"And Washington himself understood from the very outset of his administration that nearly everything he did would create a precedent for other presidents to follow, and so Washington ends up becoming quite influential, not just in helping to define things, but also in reassuring people that this system can get off the ground and the presidency wouldn't necessarily be a tyrannical office and that the president, in fact, could be an effective part of a new government."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] If Washington's not there and they can't see an honest man taking over as president, you might very well have had an executive council."
Social Studies,"You know, they might have been wary of who would be a unitary executive and wanted to have a plural executive in order to make sure that no one person became too powerful, and another way of thinking about this is if you create a new Constitution in the wake of President Nixon, you're gonna have a different Constitution because people are more distrustful of executive authority."
Social Studies,"If you have a new Constitution after a really honest and noble and successful presidency, people are gonna write an executive article that's more favorable to the president. And the situation for Washington couldn't have been more favorable. They had seen the problems with weak execution under the articles and in the states. They thought that weak executives were a problem."
Social Studies,"They saw this person who could be a strong executive and be a responsible and wise executive and those two things conspired to create an executive that was one of the most powerful in the world. - [Professor Gerhardt] So Washington is trying to signal, look, we don't want to create tyrants here. We're not kings, we're not presidents for life. We'll serve at most for a couple terms and then we will willingly lay down our authority and let other people follow us."
Social Studies,"That's actually a critical precedent, but again, every president until Franklin Roosevelt follows and it's one that reflects Washington's special values that the most important office, ultimately, is not the office of the presidency, it's actually the office, so to speak, the position of being a citizen of this country."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that thanks to the example set by George Washington, the Framers of the Constitution felt confident that they could invest power in a president to have an energetic executive branch. But as Sai Prakash noted, the Framers might be surprised at the way the president's powers have grown over time through executive orders and the use of military force."
Social Studies,"However, Michael Gerhardt brings up an important point that in the United States the president is first and foremost a citizen, not a ruler. To learn more about Article Two, visit the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"The formal powers are listed in Article II of the United States Constitution, and it starts in Section 1 where it says the executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. And this simple statement alone has a lot of implications. As we will see, it is used as a justification for many of the informal powers of the President. The President is the executive. They run the government. Congress can pass laws and set budgets."
Social Studies,"The judicial branch can interpret laws or declare them unconstitutional. But the executive power is vested in the President. But the bulk of the powers are listed in Section 2 and Section 3. So let's read this together and let's see if we can classify these different powers as executive, legislative, foreign policy or military, or judicial powers."
Social Studies,"So Section 2 of Article II starts off with the President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States. So this is clearly a military power. You have the President of the United States being in charge of the nation's military."
Social Studies,"It then goes on to say he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices. So this is clearly an executive power or an administrative power, where he can go to the head of any of the executive departments and say, hey, I need your opinion on something, potentially in writing."
Social Studies,"Then it goes on to say and he shall have Power to grain Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment. So this is a judicial power. Grant reprieves and pardons for federal offenses. Then we read, he shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur. So this power to make treaties is clearly a foreign policy power, although it does have to be ratified by the Senate."
Social Studies,"And he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law. But the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."
Social Studies,"So all of these lines here talked about the President's power of appointment, which is why I underlined it in the executive or the administrative color, although it touches on appointments that affect these other powers. So, for example, the appointment of ambassadors is clearly going to have foreign policy implications. And judges of the Supreme Court. This could have huge judicial implications. So I will underline that in blue, as well."
Social Studies,"It then goes on to say, and this is in relation to the appointments we just talked about, the President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate. Because remember, it just talked about how the Senate has to confirm appointments. But the President does have the power to fill up vacancies while the Senate is in recess, while they're not in session, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session."
Social Studies,"And then in Section 3, we read, he, the President, although it could be a she, shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he or she shall judge necessary and expedient. He may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper."
Social Studies,"So these are all ways, these are all powers that the President has in the legislative process. And then it goes back to foreign policy. He shall receive Ambassadors and other public ministers. He shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States."
Social Studies,"This statement, he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, in conjunction with what is sometimes known as the Vesting Clause, which is at the very beginning of Article II, Section 1, that simply states the executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States. These two clauses combined have been used to justify what we will see are called informal powers, which we will go into much more depth into future videos, especially the power of the executive order."
Social Studies,"And so, in summary, if we wanna look at the executive powers of the President. The power to take care that laws be faithfully executed. Nominating officials with confirmation from the Senate. Request written opinions of administrative officials. Fill administrative vacancies during recesses. Then you have the legislative powers. Present info on the State of the Union. Recommend legislation to Congress. Convene both houses on extraordinary occasions. Adjourn Congress if House and Senate cannot agree."
Social Studies,"And can veto legislation, although Congress can overrule with a two-thirds vote. And then you have the foreign policy and military powers, which include being the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Making treaties, which have to be ratified by the Senate. Nominate ambassadors, receive ambassadors, and provide diplomatic recognition to other governments. And then finally, the judicial powers that we saw in Article 2."
Social Studies,"Reprieves and pardons for federal offenses and the power to nominate federal judges, including US Supreme Court judges. Now, as I touched on, these are the formal powers, but there's also what are known as informal powers, and we'll talk more about these in other videos. The President has a unique role in the federal government and in national discourse as a whole, and because of that, they have a lot of bargaining and persuasion power."
Social Studies,"Now, as we also touched on, we have an informal power of executive orders, which is derived from the formal powers to take care that laws be faithfully executed and the fact that the power of the executive is vested in the President. You also have things called signing statements, which we'll do future videos on, which is when a law gets passed by Congress, the President can issue a document known as a signing statement which interprets that law."
Social Studies,"And as you can imagine, that interpretation of the law could be very, very influential. And then you also have executive agreements. These are agreements with foreign governments that do not have to be ratified by the US Senate. So they're not formal treaties, but they can be agreements with governments. So I will leave you there. As you can see, the President has many tools at their disposal to influence the policy-making process."
Social Studies,"In future videos, we will talk more about these, especially the informal powers.."
Social Studies,"But going all the way back to George Washington, Presidents have issued Executive Orders. Some are fairly lightweight. They might be a directive for something to be done in a certain way, or a small regulation, or even appointing someone to a job. But sometimes these Executive Orders can be quite significant. And the constitutional justification for these Orders come mainly from two different statements in Article II of the U.S. Constitution."
Social Studies,"In Section One, it starts off saying, ""The Executive Power shall be vested in a President ""of the United States of America."" And at the end of Section Three, it says that, ""the President shall take care that the laws ""be faithfully executed."" And so, the clearest justification for an Executive Order are times when a regulation is needed or a directive is needed in order to faithfully execute the laws."
Social Studies,"But as we will see, Presidents throughout history have really pushed the boundary here and have definitely gone into territory that you might expect to be the area of Congress. Now in terms of appreciating how frequent these Executive Orders are, here is a chart that gives the average Executive Orders per year for the last few Presidents. And you can see at the low end, you have President Obama and President George W. Bush averaging about 35 or 36 Executive Orders per year."
Social Studies,"And then all the way at the high end, you get to Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Now if you were to go even further back in history, Presidents like Franklin Roosevelt had far more Executive Orders than even this. And just to appreciate some of the most significant Executive Orders ever made, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 which was delivered during the Civil War, it freed nearly three million slaves in the Confederate states."
Social Studies,"In 1942 a few months after Japan's bombardment of Pearl Harbor, Franklin Roosevelt issues Executive Order 9066 which called for the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry. Historians have really frowned on this Executive Order because it was a blatant disregard for the rights of these Americans. But at the time, Franklin Roosevelt justified it as a national security issue. And then in 1952 during the Korean war, steel workers are threatening to go on strike."
Social Studies,"And so, President Truman issues Executive Order 10340 that puts steel mills under the control of the Commerce Secretary. And the justification here was that they were in the middle of the war and that steel is an essential material for conducting the war. Now what's really interesting about this Executive Order, is that the owners of the steel mills did not like this and they take the government to Federal court. It eventually gets to the U.S. Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"It's knows as the case, Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company versus Sawyer where Sawyer was the Commerce Secretary. And the Supreme Court rules against President Truman saying that this Executive Order went beyond the bounds of even the President's implied powers. So the big picture here is that Executive Orders are a method by which Presidents over time have been able to expand their power beyond what is explicitly listed in Article II of the Constitution."
Social Studies,"Now like in all things, there is a check on that power. And much of that comes from the Supreme Court's ability to rule Executive Orders unconstitutional. But there still aren't clear boundaries on what makes an Executive Order constitutional or not. And they are likely to continue to be an area of debate when it comes to powers of the President.."
Social Studies,"In fact, it was quite infrequent for a very long time. The first signing statement was issued by James Monroe. But it was quite infrequent until we get to the modern times. And starting with Ronald Reagan, they become much, much more common for presidents of both parties. And even though it is not considered by legal scholars to be legally binding. So, not legally binding, presidents still do it. And they have multiple reasons. Sometimes, it acts as a bit of an explainer for why they are signing the law."
Social Studies,"They might say how great the law is, why they think it's a good idea. But sometimes, they also say what problems there are in the law. And in an extreme case, they can sometimes say that there are parts of the law that are unconstitutional. And those parts that are unconstitutional, the Executive Branch might not follow exactly the way the law states."
Social Studies,"Well an obvious question is, if it's not legally binding, why does the President even take the trouble? Well, the explainer purpose might be political, or it might rally up the base. But issuing a statement on the problems, it's the President's way of signaling to the entire Executive Branch and to Congress that hey, look, don't be surprised when I don't follow the letter of the law of the parts that I think are unconstitutional. And to make this tangible, let's look at some actual signing statements."
Social Studies,"This is a signing statement by President George W. Bush in 2006. Today, I have signed into law H.R. 972, the Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2005. This act enhances our ability to combat trafficking in persons by extending and improving prosecutorial and diplomatic tools, and also adds new protections for victims. So that part's kind of an explainer."
Social Studies,"But then it goes on to say, Section 104 purports to require the Secretary of State, prior to voting for a new or reauthorized peacekeeping mission under the auspices of a multilateral organization to submit to the Congress a specific report. The Executive Branch shall construe this reporting requirement in a manner consistent with the President's Constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and the President's constitutional authority to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs."
Social Studies,"And so what they're saying is, hey, hold on a second here, Congress. You want our Secretary of State, before making this decision, to submit a report every time? You're kind of starting to muck with how the Executive Branch executes there. So this is signaling a bit to the Congress as, hey, don't be surprised if we don't follow this exactly the way that you are expecting. You have a similar tone in an executive order from President Obama in 2009. Today, I have signed into law H.R."
Social Studies,"1105, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. This bill completes the work of last year by providing the funding necessary for the smooth operation of our Nation's Government. So once again, a bit of an explainer. But then it goes on to say, the Department of Justice has advised that a small number of provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns. And then it goes on to list actually several bullet points, and I'm just going to give you one of them, just so you get a sense of things."
Social Studies,"Legislative aggrandizements, committee approval requirements. So, when you aggrandize yourself, it's making yourself more than you really are. And so a legislative aggrandizement is the legislative branch trying to go beyond their legislative powers. Numerous provisions of the legislation purport to condition the authority of officers to spend or reallocate funds on the approval of congressional committees."
Social Studies,"These are impermissible forms of legislative aggrandizement in the execution of the laws other than by enactment of statutes. Therefore, although my administration will notify the relevant committees before taking the specified actions and will accord the recommendations of such committees all appropriate and serious consideration, spending decisions shall not be treated as dependent on the approval of congressional committees."
Social Studies,"So, here in this signing statement, President Obama's saying, look, this is overstepping the bounds of legislative authority to tell us how we will spend these things. We'll take your advice under consideration, but dictating how to execute is not the job of the Legislative Branch. So I'll leave you there. I encourage you to look up more presidential signing statements. They're readily available on the internet. They're part of the Federal Registry. And think about why presidents do this."
Social Studies,"And, what role does this have? And why this is considered an informal power of the President.."
Social Studies,"We could talk about federal judges generally, but perhaps most importantly, they can appoint members of the Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court, and that is a very influential appointment because these are positions that will last for a lifetime, but this power is not unchecked."
Social Studies,"These appointments need to be confirmed by the United States Senate, and many times, the confirmation process goes relatively smoothly, but sometimes, especially when we're talking about lifetime judicial appointments, especially to the United States Supreme Court, things can get quite heated, and perhaps the best example of that is something that has happened quite recently relatively to the making of this video. 2016 was an election year."
Social Studies,"In February of 2016, you have associate Justice Scalia passes away. Now this is a really, really big deal because, as we talked about, Supreme Court appointments are for life, and so in theory this is now a time where the president would make a nomination. Now the president does make a nomination. President Barack Obama in March of 2016 nominates Merrick Garland."
Social Studies,"Now the Republicans are not happy, and Republicans control both houses of Congress, but most important for this video, they control the Senate, and the reason why they are not happy is Justice Scalia was considered to be the conservative backbone of the United States Supreme Court, and if all of a sudden he is replaced with someone who leans to the left, who leans liberal, that could change the tone."
Social Studies,"That could change the sentiment of the United States Supreme Court for a generation or maybe even generations to come. So they invoke their power in the Senate, which is controlled by Mitch McConnell, who is the Senate majority leader. He decides to take a hard stance, and even though President Obama had nominated Merrick Garland, the Republicans make the argument that, ""Hey, this is a presidential election year."
Social Studies,"""We're just gonna wait things out,"" so they refused to have hearings on Merrick Garland, much less vote on his nomination, and so they essentially just wait out the clock through the presidential election, and then at the presidential election, you have a Republican who gets elected, Donald Trump, and so then they are able to help get Donald Trump's appointment for that seat approved, and even that is a little bit of an interesting political story."
Social Studies,"So this is a classic example of a congressional check on a presidential power, and this one in particular gets people on both sides of the aisle a little bit worked up."
Social Studies,"Democrats would say, ""Wow, you did not consider an appointment by a president, ""and you waited out many, many, many months ""just to get an outcome you wanted?"" While Republicans might say, ""Wow, Mitch McConnell was really principled here, ""and he really used the Senate's constitutional power ""to place an appropriate check on the president."" I will let you decide.."
Social Studies,"For example, as early as 1803, you have the Louisiana Purchase, where you have Thomas Jefferson buying land from Napoleon's France. It does not say explicitly anywhere in the Constitution that presidents are allowed to buy land from foreign countries. You fast-forward a good bit to the Great Depression. You have Franklin Delano Roosevelt who serves four terms in office, four terms in office, and also starts creating all of these various agencies in order to help stimulate the economy, so creates agencies."
Social Studies,"And many of the things that he did were not explicitly listed as powers of the president. And as you can imagine, as any member of the government, especially the president, starts taking on powers that aren't explicitly listed, it make make other people a little bit afraid. And so in reaction to some of this, there have been actions taken. For example, because FDR had his four terms, you have the 22nd Amendment."
Social Studies,"And the 22nd Amendment says that no one can be elected to the office of the president more than two times, and no one can serve more than 10 years in office. The 10 years would become a problem if you can take on office in the second half of someone else's administration and then you get elected twice. And so the 22nd Amendment was really a check on this type of expansion of presidential power. Later on, you have things like the War Powers Act."
Social Studies,"Let me write that, War Powers Act, which is from 1973, and this is at the end of the Vietnam War. Congress has been concerned. How did we get embroiled in the war, a war, that in the early days, did not have any type of official authorization from Congress, but American troops were put on the ground in a foreign country. And so the War Powers Act in 1973 says that a president has to get congressional buy-in within 60 days of committing American troops."
Social Studies,"But to help us understand this issue, let's go all the way back to the Federalist Papers. Remember, the Federalist Papers were written in an attempt to get the Constitution ratified. And for the sake of this video, we're going to focus on Federalist number 70, written by Alexander Hamilton. In Federalist number 70, Alexander Hamilton makes the case why you need to have a single individual who has significant power at the head of the Executive Branch."
Social Studies,"And you can imagine this would have made some people wary because the United States had just gotten independence from George III, a king, and so some people might have been wary about kings, and might have wanted, maybe not one person in charge, or maybe a committee in charge. But this is what Hamilton wrote. Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government."
Social Studies,"It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy... A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government."
Social Studies,"A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution; and a government ill executed, whatever it may be in theory, must, in practice, a bad government... That unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed. Decision, activity, secrecy, and despatch will generally characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree than the proceedings of any greater number, and in proportion as the number is increased, that qualities will be diminished..."
Social Studies,"So he's making the argument for an energetic executive, and he's saying that, ""Look, that power needs to be one person."" Otherwise, it's going be diluted amongst many, and the more people you have at the top of the executive, then these qualities of energy, of decisiveness, are going to be diminished. And it's interesting."
Social Studies,"He also talks about secrecy, which you don't always view as a positive, but maybe the argument is if you really need to execute well, you don't have to tell everyone what you're doing, especially if you're trying to conduct a war and you don't want national secrets to get out. The plurality of the Executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated power."
Social Studies,"So here he's further building the case that hey, if you have many people in the executive, at the head of the executive, it's going to deprive the people of two great securities. First, the restraints of public opinion, which lose their efficacy, as well on account of the division of the censure attendant on bad measures among a number, as on account of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall. So he's saying the restraints of public opinion don't work as well if there's many people at the top."
Social Studies,"If many people are making these executive decisions, then they don't know who to hold accountable. They don't know who to blame. And secondly, the opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the misconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to their removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which admit of it... So once again, they're saying if it's one person leading the executive and they do something bad, you can punish them. You can remove them from office."
Social Studies,"But if it's many people, who do you blame? It might not be easy to hold them accountable. But then if we fast-forward to 1973, think about the situation that the country was in. We were at the end of the Vietnam War. President Nixon was going through the Watergate investigations, and you have the author Arthur Schlesinger Jr. writes The Imperial presidency."
Social Studies,"And it says right over here, ""The Pulitzer Prize-winning historian traces the escalation ""of Presidential power and considers what Congress ""and the people can do about it."" And here is an excerpt of what he wrote. Secrecy seemed to promise government three inestimable advantages: the power to withhold, the power to leak and the power to lie... So it's clear that Arthur Schlesinger is not as big of a fan as secrecy as Alexander Hamilton was."
Social Studies,"The power to withhold held out the hope of denying the public the knowledge that would make possible an independent judgment on executive policy. The mystique of inside information -- ""if you only knew ""what we know"" -- was a most effective way to defend the national security monopoly and prevent democratic control of foreign policy..."
Social Studies,"So he's saying, look, if you allow people to just not tell you things, they'll just say, hey, if you only knew what we knew, you would do what we're doing, but we can't tell you what we know, so you just have to trust us. The power to leak meant the power to tell the people what it served the government's purpose that they should know... So once again, they can hold secret, and say, ""Hey, trust us."
Social Studies,"We're doing what's the right thing,"" but then they could selectively leak so that only certain information gets out that once again, could be in the interest of those in power. The power to withhold and the power to leak lead inexorably to the power to lie. The secrecy system instilled in the executive branch the idea that foreign policy was no one's business save its own, and the uncontrolled secrecy made it easy for lying to become routine."
Social Studies,"It was in this spirit that Eisenhower concealed the CIA operations it was mounting against governments around the world. It was in this spirit that the Kennedy administration stealthily sent the Cuban brigade to the Bay of Pigs, and stealthily enlarged American involvement in Vietnam."
Social Studies,"It was in this spirit that the Johnson administration Americanized the Vietnam War, misrepresenting one episode after another to Congress and the people-- Tonkin Gulf, which was the resolution based on a perceived attack on an American ship, which was later judged to be just an explosion, the first American ground force commitment, the bombing of North Vietnam, My Lai and the rest. And the My Lai Massacre is a famous massacre that eventually got out and it showed a massacre of civilians in Vietnam."
Social Studies,"But I'll let you decide. And it doesn't have to be the case that Alexander Hamilton was right 100% or that Arthus Schlesinger is right 100%. It could be the case that, well, for the most part, it is important for an executive to have some degree of secrecy. Even some of the things that Arthur Schlesinger has talked about, where we're talking about the Bay of Pigs or we're talking about the CIA operations, remember, this was during the Cold War. You had the Soviet Union out there with all of its spies."
Social Studies,"If it knew what was going on, it might be able to undermine American actions. So some degree of secrecy absolutely was necessary, but on the other hand, maybe there is a point that sometimes that secrecy does allow those in power to do things that would make the general public very upset about their actions.."
Social Studies,"And they realized that the first president, George Washington, and this is why he was so important, was a man of virtue and that he in his behavior would set the precedence for the next president after him. That means the job is basically handed off by tradition from president to president but that also-- - And the reason why they didn't know what a president should do is that there wasn't a notion of a, there wasn't a precedent for being a president. - That's right, they knew what they didn't want."
Social Studies,"They didn't want two things, they didn't want a king, they'd just gotten rid of one of those. They didn't want a king and they also didn't want somebody who's whipped around by mob rule. Those were the two things they were trying to get between. But, a president has a lot of room to move in between the two of them, and they thought we'll put it in the hands of a virtuous American."
Social Studies,"George Washington, a good first virtuous American, and that person, through their virtue and character, would stay in the right place. Would not become a king and would not give over to the mob, but it also meant that it relied on the character of the person in the presidency. And so, each president in subsequent years, has taken shape in the presidency both by what was determined by their predecessors, but also by what they could do in the job."
Social Studies,"And what's happened is, a job that started out very weak in the American system has now become one where some people think of all the entire of American government as the president. And that's not what the founders wanted. - But how does that evolve? 'Cause obviously the constitution talks about the powers of the president. So, how does it change so much over time? - What happened was, when they originally created the presidency there was a debate, and the debate was, we need somebody who can move quickly."
Social Studies,"We can't always be calling them in to Congress because, of course, when the America was started they used to take several months, or sometimes it would take weeks to get on a horse and get to Washington. So, we need an executive who can move quickly. Well, what happened was, in various wars, America needed to move quickly, and they needed one person to act on behalf of the entire Union. Well, there's only one person who can do that."
Social Studies,"But, as people wanted quick action they handed over more power to the president. Congress, which used to fight with the president a lot, during the Second World War and then on into our present day, has given up a lot of its power to the president. One of the key ones being the power to make war. Presidents can now go and make war. Well, that's not the original way it was arranged."
Social Studies,"And they've done it because there is a hunger in the country for quick action, but the problem and challenge of that is, if you invest somebody in with power to do things quickly in an emergency, they hold on to that power and they don't let it go, and that means that they start doing things when it's not an emergency, that is then not vetted by the American system."
Social Studies,"And that system has both the judiciary and the legislative which are meant to hold back a president who's trying to act too quickly and do too much. - Let's go on this notion of making war as an example. There's clear powers that Congress has to approve a war, has the power of the purse, So, how did this happen? They just do that as a ritual now? - Well, basically there are times and Congress tries and makes attempts to try to pull power back from the president."
Social Studies,"The only times they've been successful after the Second World War is really after Watergate. The view was that the president had gotten too powerful. That President Nixon, who left the office, had abused the office and so Congress tried to pull some power back, but again, political parties which are now very close to the president. It used to be that political parties were not so powerful."
Social Studies,"If I'm a Republican in Congress and I want my Republican president to do well, I'm gonna give him the power he wants because we're connected. In the old days, if the president in the office was my party, well that's nice, but I've got my own views and I'm in Congress, and I'm gonna do what I want."
Social Studies,"And so, essentially a lot of these powers that have gone to the president have been handed over to him, not with a ceremony, but just by a lack of a fight by members of Congress, in withdrawing from their traditional role as the founders wanted it as the key actor in American government. That's no longer case, in America today, the president is the key actor. - And then every time that happens the next president or the next several presidents, we allowed that to happen to that person."
Social Studies,"I should have that power as well. - That's exactly right. It's almost like the powers conveyed to the new president like the furniture in the Oval Office. And so, they think, well this chair's pretty comfortable. (Sal laughs) I'm not gonna get rid of that and sit in the old uncomfortable wooden chair. I want all the plush trappings. And here's another reason."
Social Studies,"American politics has created a situation, and television has made this so much worse, where people run for office promising the sun, the moon, and the stars. So, they say I can, Donald Trump, when he was running said I alone can fix it. That is not the way the country was originally founded. That one person could fix or unfix things. It was supposed to be a country with representatives of the entire country."
Social Studies,"But, politics has created a system where, whether it's a Republican or Democrat, they run by saying I can do anything. Well, that means when you get in the office you want those quick powers that allow you to keep those campaign promises, and those quick powers are only quick if Congress and the courts aren't in the way. So, politics and the way you run for office makes presidents want to have every possible power at their disposal.."
Social Studies,"This term, bully pulpit, probably isn't exactly what you imagine it to mean. It actually comes to us from Theodore Roosevelt, that's a picture of Theodore Roosevelt giving a speech. He was president from 1901 to 1909. He was actually the youngest person to hold the office of President. He took office when President McKinley was assassinated, and this is a quote from 1909, from Lyman Abbott, who wrote for ""The Outlook"". ""Half a dozen of us were with the President, Theodore Roosevelt, in his library."
Social Studies,"He was sitting at his desk reading to us his forthcoming message. He had just finished reading a paragraph of a distinctly ethical character when he suddenly stopped, swung round in his swivel chair and said, 'I suppose my critics will call that preaching, but I have got such a bully pulpit!'"" Theodore Roosevelt was famous for using the term ""bully"" a lot, and it doesn't mean to pick on people in Theodore Roosevelt's context. He used it as great, wonderful. Bully for you, good for you."
Social Studies,"When he said ""a bully pulpit"", he's saying, ""I have such a great platform from which to speak."" He's not saying I have a platform from which to pick on people. And this was before mass media became a significant influence in politics. At this time, recorded audio was just starting to become a thing. Television was not an influence in politics."
Social Studies,"But you can imagine, once you have mass media, especially radio, television, and now social media becoming a major factor, this bully pulpit has only gotten more and more and more significant. One of the strongest examples of Presidents using their bully pulpit is the State of the Union address. the Union. The Constitution does call for the President to make reports to Congress on the state of the union, but early Presidents, like Thomas Jefferson, just sent a written report."
Social Studies,"But, eventually, over time, the President started giving live reports to the joint houses of Congress in the form of a speech, and then in 1947, you have Truman's State of the Union is televised. Truman televised. Today, the State of the Union is given every January, this is a major event. All the major networks show it, the nation pays attention. What Theodore Roosevelt was talking about becomes even more powerful for modern presidents that have mass media at their disposal."
Social Studies,"To get a good, tangible sense of this power that a President has, I'm gonna show you a video from 1981. This actually will not be a State of the Union address. This is an address that President Reagan gives to the nation on federal tax reduction. Just so that you have context on what the world was like, or what the United States was like, in 1981, they had stagflation, a stagnant economy with a lot of inflation and high interest rates."
Social Studies,"I remember, at the time, my mom had, I think it was a 17% interest rate on her mortgage, which was incredibly, incredibly high. What you're going to see is President Reagan making a direct plea to the American people to convince their representatives to support his tax plan, and think about what President Reagan was able to do that Thomas Jefferson, or even Theodore Roosevelt, could have only dreamed of. - The best way to have a strong foreign policy abroad is to have a strong economy at home."
Social Studies,"Now, the day after tomorrow, Wednesday, the House of Representatives will begin debate on two tax bills, and once again, they need to hear from you. I know that doesn't give you much time, but a great deal is at stake. Let me add, those representatives honestly and sincerely want to know your feelings. They get plenty of input from the special interest groups. They'd like to hear from their home folks. Let me explain what the situation is and what's at issue."
Social Studies,"With our budget cuts, we presented a complete program of reduction in tax rates. Again, our purpose was to provide incentive for the individual, incentives for business to encourage production and hiring of the unemployed, and to free up money for investment. Our bill calls for a 5% reduction in the income tax rates by October 1st, a 10% reduction beginning July 1st, 1982, and another 10% cut a year later. A 25% total reduction over three years."
Social Studies,"But then, to insure the tax cut is permanent, we call for indexing the tax rates in 1985, which means adjusting them for inflation. As it is now, if you get a cost of living raise that's intended to keep you even with inflation, you find that the increase in the number of dollars you get may very likely move you into a higher tax bracket, and you wind up poorer than you were. This is called bracket creep. Bracket creep is an insidious tax. Let me give an example."
Social Studies,"If you earned $10,000 a year in 1972, by 1980, you had to earn $19,700 just to stay even with inflation, but that's before taxes. Come April 15th, you find your tax rates have increased 30%. Have you been wondering why you don't seem as well off as you were a few years back? It's because government makes a profit on inflation.."
Social Studies,"Jeff Rosen is the President and CEO of the National Constitution Center, and he's written extensively about the courts and the Supreme Court in particular. Richard Garnett is a professor of law and political science at the University of Notre Dame School of Law. Jeff, can you tell us a little bit about the Framer's vision for the judicial branch? How much power did they intend for the judicial branch to have? - [Jeff] Let's start by reading the text. That's always the best place to start."
Social Studies,"The text of Article III, the very first sentence says, ""The judicial Power of the United States, ""shall be vested in one supreme Court, ""and in such inferior Courts as Congress may ""from time to time establish."" The Framers expected that we would have a Supreme Court and that would be separate from the legislature and the president, but it was up for Congress to decide what other federal courts we'd have, if any."
Social Studies,"And it's so interesting that the Framers are so focused on a system where state courts are the main interaction that people have with the judicial system. They didn't even require Congress to set up inferior federal courts at all. - [Kim] So what does Article III tell us about how the judicial branch is supposed to be structured? - [Richard] Well, it doesn't say a whole lot. It's interesting. So some people are surprised when you actually read the text of Article III."
Social Studies,"It sets up the Supreme Court, and it says that all of the federal judicial power is gonna be in that Supreme Court, but it doesn't tell us anything about, say, courts of appeals or trial courts. It clearly envisions that Congress is gonna create some, but it really did leave it to Congress to decide how to structure the judicial system."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So what are some of the ways that the role of the Supreme Court has changed over time? - [Richard] I think it's fair to say that there's a lot more federal law than there used to be, and so there are more questions that are potentially questions for the Supreme Court than there used to be. I mean, if you think of the country's early history, most of the legal action was in the states and the state courts and the state legislatures."
Social Studies,"There wasn't that much, there weren't that many questions for the Supreme Court to answer. As the federal government grows, as federal law expands, that creates more work for the Supreme Court. What does equal protection mean? What does due process mean? What's the balance between the freedom of speech on the one hand and intellectual property on the other say? These are questions that the Founders might not have been able to envision being judicial questions."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] Alexander Hamilton, Federalist 78, famously said that the judiciary would be the least dangerous branch because it had neither purse nor sword. The Framers thought the Congress would be the most dangerous branch because it had the most enumerated powers. The presidency second, 'cause limited but constrained powers, and judiciary the least dangerous because it didn't have the army and it had no money and all it could do was issue judgments and hope that they would be accepted by the other branches."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So say that I'm a Supreme Court justice. Good work, me. (laughing) And a case comes before me and it's up to me now to interpret the Constitution in such a way that I can answer questions about this certain case."
Social Studies,"So what would be some of the tools that I could use to help me in my interpretation? - [Richard] Well, there's obviously deep and fascinating disagreements among people about how exactly courts should do that, but one place where you could start, and I think there'd be common ground here, is that all justices believe that it's important to ask, how has the Supreme Court answered questions like this in the past? So the first place you would look would be to the court's own precedents."
Social Studies,"Has the court answered questions like this before? And if so, what did the court say? Because there is a strong sense that the rule of law needs predictability and consistency, and so courts really do make an effort to have their rulings be consistent over time. - [Jeff] You might also be interested in empirical facts. What would be the effect of a particular decision on the country? You might also be interested in theories of natural law, which we talked about in discussing the 9th Amendment."
Social Studies,"Even if the right being asserted isn't written down in the Constitution, is there some case that it is rooted in the history and tradition of our law and that it might come from sources like God or nature and not government? Generally, judges have been reluctant to enforce rights, natural rights, that don't have a positive foundation. A positive right is a right that's written down or codified in some explicit way. A natural right comes from God or nature."
Social Studies,"But in practice, most of the natural rights have tended to be codified in history or tradition and in state constitutions or state laws, so those would be other places you'd look too. But what's really important for viewers to remember, and I want all of you guys to try to do this yourselves, try this yourselves at home, separate your constitutional conclusions from your political conclusions."
Social Studies,"When you're evaluating a law, don't ask, do I think that this form of, say, gun control regulation is a good or bad idea as a policy matter. Ask yourself, do I think the 2nd Amendment allows or prohibits it, and entertain the possibility that your constitutional conclusions might diverge from your political conclusions. You might think gun control is a good idea, but the 2nd Amendment prohibits it, or it's a bad idea but the Constitution allows it."
Social Studies,"And that basic separation of political and constitutional conclusions is central to Hamilton's very theory of judicial review, because that's what stops judges from being policy makers in robes and ensures that they're preferring the will of the people expressed in the Constitution to those of the legislatures, which represent fallible policy views."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] As we learned from early cases like Marbury versus Madison and then even later cases like Brown versus Board of Education, the Supreme Court can render decisions that then no one enforces."
Social Studies,"So how has the Supreme Court avoided becoming kind of a moot point? - [Richard] Yeah, there's a story, and it might be apocryphal, but it's a good story anyway, that President Andrew Jackson said, after the Supreme Court issued an opinion that he didn't like, he said, ""The Supreme Court has issued its opinion, ""now let them enforce it."" Basically making the point that all they could do was issue an opinion and it was up to others to decide to comply."
Social Studies,"I think American culture, and this is something for us to be grateful for, it's been built up over a long time. It has generally been that we have a strong norm, that elected officials should follow the law as it's been declared by the federal courts."
Social Studies,"Now there've been, as you know, controversies about court decisions throughout our history, whether it was the Dred Scott case, which President Lincoln hated, or, as you said, Brown versus Board, which was resisted by some Southern officials after it came down. The court's ability to get its judgments enforced depends on its credibility and on America's culture of respecting the rule of law."
Social Studies,"If the court's credibility goes away, or if Americans stop respecting the rule of law, then the court's judgments will have less force. - [Kim] So the Supreme Court exercises the power of judicial review, which means that it reviews the actions of the executive branch and the legislative branch and can declare those actions unconstitutional."
Social Studies,Do you think the Framers intended for the court to use that power to check the other branches of government? - [Richard] Most scholars would agree that it was widely believed that the Supreme Court would have the power to review the acts of both other federal officials and of state governments and to decide whether or not those acts were consistent with the Constitution.
Social Studies,"There was a lotta disagreement about how excited people were about that power, and again, some people worried that the Supreme Court might abuse its power of judicial review. But the basic idea that it's one of the jobs of a court to make sure that the acts of other officials are constitutional, are consistent with the written Constitution, that idea preexisted Marbury. That idea was clearly in the minds of the Founders when they created the Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] I'm happy to say yes, the Framers did intend for the courts to have the power of judicial review. I'm confident of that both because the power was exercised by courts before and after the framing, and also because Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 78, so explicitly puts the case for judicial review."
Social Studies,"It's such a shame that in that great musical we've got the room where it happened but we don't have the judicial review where it happened, because Hamilton would be a great song about why Hamilton thought that judicial review followed logically from the very theory of popular sovereignty. - [Richard] It really isn't the job of unelected judges to try to update and improve the Constitution that the people ratified."
Social Studies,"In some cases, this isn't much of a challenge, but in others, say, in cases having to do with the freedom of speech or in cases having to do with the war powers and so on, it can be a challenge. It can be a challenge to figure out what exactly the provision meant to those who ratified it, and it can be a challenge to decide whether, if at all, the original meaning needs to be updated in light of more current events."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] Now, there is, of course, much to say in response to Hamilton, and we could have a whole constitutional law course on the responses to Hamilton. His very theory of judicial review is premised on the idea that the Constitution represents the will of the people more emblematically or profoundly or fundamentally than those of ordinary laws."
Social Studies,"The obvious first response is, ""Hey, how can you say that the will of a bunch of dead ""white guys from 1787 ""really represents the will of we, the people of today, ""more accurately than a law that Congress passes?"" The answer to the objection is, well, it's because the Constitution was passed by a special procedure. It was unusually deliberative."
Social Studies,"It took a long time to propose, and it didn't gain the status of supreme law until it was ratified by special conventions that were specially called for the purpose. It was that long process of deliberation that gives that constitutional text the right to speak in we the people's name."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] How could the legislative or executive branch check the power of the Supreme Court? - [Richard] Yeah, our Constitution has a number of these interesting checks and balances features, right? So the three branches are distinct, but there's various ways in which they get into each other's business. The President can veto a law. The President appoints justices, but of course, the Senate has the say about whether to confirm them, and so on."
Social Studies,"So the branches are separate, but they are related and they check each other. - [Jeff] Well, we remember from the text of Article III that the Constitution authorizes Congress to set up such inferior courts as it may, from time to time, choose to ordain and establish. Congress didn't have to create inferior courts. It can create them, it can change them. There's a debate right now about whether the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which occupies much of the west, should be split up."
Social Studies,"Congress can split it up if it wants. Congress can change the number of Supreme Court justices. There were originally six justices and the number went up and down before settling around nine, or rather settling at nine, in the 1860's. So Congress could change the number of justices to punish a president on political grounds."
Social Studies,"When Thomas Jefferson was coming in after the election of 1800, the outgoing Federalist Congress was so determined to punish him that they changed the size of the Supreme Court to deny him the right to make any appointments. - [Richard] The other branches can check the court in a number of ways. So the most dramatic would be you can impeach a justice for high crimes and misdemeanors. That doesn't happen very often."
Social Studies,"Another way, which doesn't happen all that often, but could, is Congress can check the court by, for example, not funding it, or by limiting the issues that the court is allowed to hear. Congress can control what's called the jurisdiction of the court. The court only gets to answer the questions that Congress gives it the power to answer. Now again, Congress is reluctant to do that, but it has sometimes in the past, and it could if Congress thought it were necessary."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] Congress can engage in jurisdiction stripping. There's only a small category of cases that the Supreme Court is required to hear. But broadly, the court has a broad discretion over its docket. If Congress wanted to say, ""Hey, Supreme Court, ""you're not allowed to hear any cases involving abortion,"" for example, it arguably could do that, although such a law might be constitutionally challenged."
Social Studies,"I remember being in law school just kind of indignant at the idea that Congress could violate the separation of powers so flagrantly. My great law professor Akhil Amar convinced me that this had been done throughout American history, that before, during the Civil War, Congress deprived the court of the right to hear certain cases involving national security and so forth."
Social Studies,"So Congress can, if it chooses, exempt certain categories of cases, those that are not in the original jurisdiction of the court, from being heard. There's also the question of whether Congress can impose term limits for Supreme Court justices. There's a proposal floating about to have 18-year terms for the justices and get each president the right to appoint two justices, and have justices retire after 18-year terms."
Social Studies,"There's a vigorous debate about whether that could be done by an ordinary statute, or whether it would require a constitutional amendment. - [Kim] Well, if you had to say there was one big take away about Article III that students should remember, what might it be? - [Jeff] That when courts strike down laws as unconstitutional, they're not thwarting the will of the people, they're supposed to be supporting it."
Social Studies,"Because the Constitution represents the will of the people, ordinary laws represent the will of our representatives. The Constitution is supreme law, so that's why it trumps ordinary legislation. - [Richard] You know, Americans of good faith and good reason have been disagreeing about the court's role for the long time."
Social Studies,"I think a challenge for the court is finding the right balance between asserting its independence and exercising judicial review on the one hand, but on the other, being mindful of the fact that it is undemocratic. The judicial review sometimes involves setting aside what the people have decided they want. That's an awesome power, and it shouldn't be overused."
Social Studies,"So the court, from time to time in history, has been criticized for, perhaps, going beyond what the Constitution actually requires, and instead enforcing, perhaps, their own policy preferences or their own political morality. - [Kim] So we've learned that Article III is crucial to the system of checks and balances that limits the power of government in the United States."
Social Studies,The Supreme Court exercises judicial review to ensure that the executive branch and legislative branch act within the confines of the Constitution. But the other branches have plenty of checks on the judicial branch as well. One of the most central questions about the Supreme Court is the relevance of the Constitution to the issues we face today.
Social Studies,"As Richard Garnett points out, some scholars might say it's undemocratic to overrule the will of the people as expressed through their elected representatives based on the Constitution. But, as Jeff Rosen argues, the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and therefore striking down a law as unconstitutional isn't thwarting the will of the people, but rather preserving it."
Social Studies,"To learn more about Article III, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,Michael Klarman is a legal historian and the Kirkland and Ellis Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Kevin Walsh is a professor of law at the University if Richmond Law School.
Social Studies,"So, Professor Walsh, can you tell us a little bit about what was happening in this case? Can you set the stage? - [Kevin] Sure, you're right, the case wasn't decided until 1803, but to understand where it came from, you really have to go back to the election of 1800, and this election pitted John Adams, the incumbent, Federalist president, against his former vice president, Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic Republican."
Social Studies,"And long story short, Jefferson ended up being President, and we have skipped a lot of really interesting things there, but Jefferson ultimately won. The Federalist who controlled Congress, seeing what was happening, made a present for the incoming administration in the form of some laws that created some new judgeships. So some new federal judges, as well as some justices of the peace in the District of Columbia."
Social Studies,"And then they proceeded to stuff those offices with loyal Federalists, and these were people like William Marbury, who was granted a commission as justice of the peace in DC."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] Marbury was appointed by the Federalist President, the outgoing Federalist President, John Adams, to be a justice of the peace in Washington DC, but John Marshall, who was both Secretary of State and Chief Justice of the United States under John Adams, he didn't have a chance to deliver the commission, because these were midnight judges who were appointed almost at the last minute, as the Adams Administration was going out the door."
Social Studies,"So the commission for Marbury was still sitting on the desk of the new Secretary of State, James Madison, when the Jefferson Administration took over. And the Jeffersonians were outraged by what they saw as an effort to pack the judiciary by the outgoing administration, so they were refusing to deliver the commission."
Social Studies,"Marbury wants his commission, so he brings a lawsuit in the United States Supreme Court demanding that Secretary of State, James Madison, deliver the commission to him, and that's what leads to the case Marbury versus Madison. - [Kevin] So really, this is a case about some men trying to get the jobs that President Adams had appointed them to, but that they weren't able to get because President Jefferson and his administration refused to deliver the piece of paper entitling them to actually take the job."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Very interesting, so this election of 1800, I think, is very significant in American history because it was the first peaceful transfer of power between two political parties. The Federalists, kind of led by John Adams, who added this stronger central government as one of their core ideals, and then the anti-Federalists, or Democratic Republicans, led by Madison and Jefferson who wanted a weaker central government, more power to the states."
Social Studies,"So I think it's one of the coolest things in American history that a political party voluntarily gave up power, like when else in the history of the world did a ruling party just say, ah, you know what, now our enemies can rule. But, there's also this political fallout from this transfer of power between parties."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] And this is the first time that Jeffersonian Republicans are gonna be able to take control of the national government, and the Federalists, the outgoing Adams Administration, are horrified by this. They think of Jefferson as an anarchist, an atheist, they accused him during the campaign of being a miscegenator. They allege, it turns out correctly, that he sleeps with his slaves."
Social Studies,"They allege that in New England he'll be stealing their Bibles if elected, and the Jeffersonians don't think much better of John Adams. They think he wants to be a king. He nearly got the country into an unnecessary war with France. So there's tremendous political animosity. Neither side really sees the opposite side as the loyal political opposition, and then there's personal acrimony as well. Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall, both from Virginia, are distant cousins. They hate each other."
Social Studies,"John Marshall certainly didn't think Jefferson ought to be elected President in 1800, and Jefferson thinks that John Marshall as chief justice is trying to undermine the federal republic through his nationalist rulings on the Supreme Court. - [Kevin] Well, it wasn't a pretty transfer. John Adams left in a huff the morning that Jefferson was going to be inaugurated, but it was, as you say, it was a peaceful transition."
Social Studies,"But the thing is, is a lot of the issues that come with transferring power from one political party to another, these were new issues for the country. And understandably, the Jefferson Administration resented the Federalist's attempt to put their loyalists into the judiciary. - [Michael] The Jeffersonians have won the presidential election, they've won the congressional elections by even more."
Social Studies,"The only branch of the federal government still controlled by the Federalists is the judiciary, and now they're packing the judiciary. They're creating 16 new federal court of appeals judges, 42 new justices of the peace, they're actually diminishing the size of the Supreme Court from six to five so as to deprive Jefferson of an opportunity to appoint a new justice for one of those who is retiring. This is outrageous."
Social Studies,"And Jefferson also thinks it's outrageous that Marbury has filed a suit in the Supreme Court and has asked the Supreme Court to order the President of the United States to do something, which Jefferson thinks is a violation of the separation of powers. - [Kim] So, William Marbury is one of these judges that John Adams had appointed in the midnight hour."
Social Studies,"He decides to sue, and this is directly to the Supreme Court, right? 'Cause it's in the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction? - [Kevin] Okay, so he sues directly in the Supreme Court. Right now we think of the Supreme Court generally as a court that hears appeals, right? Usually you don't go there in the first instance. But as we said, this was a new thing. And it was also new to be suing the executive branch."
Social Studies,"So it makes sense, if you think about it, if you're going after the President and the President's Secretary of State to go directly to the Supreme Court. - [Michael] Marbury brought the suit in the Supreme Court, but the question and the case is whether the Supreme Court can here this within its constitutional original jurisdiction."
Social Studies,"So under the Article III of the constitution, at least as John Marshall chooses to interpret it, in Marbury versus Madison, this particular case can't be in the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. It could only be filed somewhere else and then appealed to the Supreme Court. - [Kim] So John Marshall's a pretty big figure in the history of the Supreme Court. Can you tell us just a little bit more about who he is and why he's so important? - [Kevin] Sure, he is still the longest serving chief justice."
Social Studies,"John Marshall was chief justice from 1801 to 1835. He was appointed by President Adams in early 1801. This was one of the final acts of Adams' administration, and he went on to say that it was the proudest thing he had done for the American people. Marshall was a Federalist from Virginia. So this made him a little bit odd, because the leading political figures in Virginia were Democratic Republicans. But Marshall had been a soldier in the Continental Army."
Social Studies,"He was at Valley Forge with Washington and with Hamilton, and his experience is under the Continental Congress and under the Articles of Confederation, and then later serving in state government in Virginia, made him realize that we needed a much stronger national government. And that's what turned him into a Federalist. So he was really in the mold of Washington and Hamilton. And so this put him at odds with the new President Jefferson when Jefferson took office."
Social Studies,"Nevertheless, over the course of the three and a half decades that he was on the Supreme Court, Marshall gained a reputation for being above politics, above party, and he was really successful in bringing the court together as an institution, to speak usually with one voice, for the constitution. So his great success was to identify himself with the Court, to identify the Court with the Constitution, and to identify the Constitution with the people."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] All right, so Marbury sues for his commission as a federal judge, and then Marshall and the Supreme Court are tasked with this issue of figuring out whether Marbury should get his commission or not. So can you take us through Marshall's thinking? How did he reason his way to the answer in this case? - [Michael] So there are two different dimensions to Marshall's thinking. One is the dimension of a lawyer, and the other is the dimension of a political strategist."
Social Studies,"Marshall understands that if he issues an order to the Jefferson Administration to deliver the commission he will be defied. He knows that almost to a certainty. James Madison has refused even to show up in court in response to an order to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not be issued. - [Kevin] So mandamus is from the same root as mandatory or mandate, right? It's an order."
Social Studies,"And here the issue was did the judiciary have the power using this writ of mandamus, to order the Secretary of State to do something. - [Michael] So Marshall has to figure out, what can he do that isn't gonna make the court look hopelessly weak, if he just says there's no jurisdiction then people are gonna think he's supine and he's afraid to challenge the President."
Social Studies,"But if he orders the President to deliver the commission, which is what he'd like to do, he knows Jefferson will defy him, and he has no authority, he has no enforcement capacity. So then the court will just look impotent. So what he wants to do instead is, he wants to act by indirection. The first thing he says is, the President's not above the law. The President can be mandamused. The second thing he says, in this particular case a writ of mandamus would be the appropriate remedy."
Social Studies,"But the third thing he says is, I have to ask whether I have jurisdiction in this case. - [Kevin] The problem is, the list of cases in the Constitution that can be heard by the Supreme Court in its original jurisdiction did not include cases like Marbury's. So this was a problem because Congress had passed a law purportedly telling the Supreme Court that it could hear cases like this. - [Kim] Ah, okay. - [Kevin] That's what Marbury was relying on."
Social Studies,"Right? He wasn't just thinking, oh I'm gonna go to the biggest court in the country. He was relying on a federal statute that seemed to give the court jurisdiction. But Marshall said that statute conflicts with what the Constitution says. It goes beyond the limits set for this court in the Constitution. And when you have a conflict between the Constitution and a federal law or any law, the Constitution wins. Right? So this is the principle that has been called Judicial Review."
Social Studies,"The idea is you have to review the laws to make sure they comply with the Constitution. And if a law is unconstitutional it can't be enforced by the Supreme Court. So it's a long way of saying that Marbury lost because the court didn't have jurisdiction. The court didn't have jurisdiction because the law that said it had jurisdiction was unconstitutional. - [Kim] Wow, okay."
Social Studies,"So there's a lot going on here, but one of the big takeaways is this notion of Judicial Review, or the idea that the Constitution wins and it's up to the Supreme Court to decide whether that's the case. Can you talk more about the affects of Judicial Review? How does it check the power of the other branches of government? - [Kevin] In order for a law to be enforced against anybody, all three branches of the government have to have taken some kind of action."
Social Studies,"So Congress had to have passed a law and the President has to sign it. Then the law has to be enforced against somebody in a way that gives rise to a legal case. And then the judiciary gets the final word in that legal case as to whether the law is constitutional. So the one way that Judicial Review operates as a check on the President and the executive, is providing a backstop against the enforcement of unconstitutional laws."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] So when the courts strike down President Trump's travel ban, that's Judicial Review. Or when the Supreme Court said President Truman exceeded his authority in ordering the seizure of the steal mills during the Korean War, that's Judicial Review. Or when the Supreme Court recently almost struck down the Affordable Care Act, that would be an exercise of Judicial Review."
Social Studies,"- [ Kim] Interesting, so this case and perhaps just Marshall as chief justice, in general made the court, I think much more powerful than it had been. Do you think this new power for the court or expansion of power for the court would have surprised the framers? - [Michael] At the Philadelphia Convention, more of the framers spoke in favor of Judicial Review than against, but the issue didn't come up very much."
Social Studies,"There wasn't that concerted a discussion of it, and they neglected to explicitly authorize the practice and the Constitution, which was kind of an oversight. It's just not a subject they spent a great deal of time talking about. And even to the extent they believed in Judicial Review, they probably didn't think the practice would be anywhere near as extensive as it's become over the course of American history."
Social Studies,"The Supreme Court just wasn't that powerful an institution in 1803, and the fact that it was declaring the power of Judicial Review, but then was declining to exercise it in Marbury is very revealing of how lacking in power the court was. - [Kevin] This was the first time that the Supreme Court exercised this power of Judicial Review, and it is something that everyone agrees, a power that everyone agrees that the Supreme Court has."
Social Studies,"And it's a big awesome power, and so it affects us because we're still arguing over how that power should be exercised, and that is an argument worth having. - [Kim] So we learned that far from simply being a case about one man's commission getting lost in the mail, Marbury versus Madison tested whether the President or Congress was above the law in the United States. Chief justice John Marshall's answer was emphatically no."
Social Studies,"And the decision in this case established an essential precedent for the Supreme Court, the power of Judicial Review. To learn more about Marbury versus Madison, check out the National Constitutional Center's interactive Constitution and Kahn Academy's resources on US Government and Politics.."
Social Studies,"And then the Supreme Court can rule that a law is unconstitutional, or it can interpret laws in a specific case. And when the Supreme Court justices make these decisions, they try to follow the principle of stare decisis, which is Latin for ""let the decision stand."" It's this idea of taking previous decisions as an example. And if we're in a similar case now, then they just use that decision as an example for this one. This is closely associated with the idea of precedent."
Social Studies,"Precedent in everyday language means something that has happened before, an action or a decision that we can use a guide or as an example. And that's exactly what the Supreme Court tries to do. If the Supreme Court has made a previous ruling on a similar case, that would be considered a precedent for this case. The Supreme Court has been often described as umpires, like umpires in a baseball game. Even Chief Justice John Roberts described it as such during his confirmation hearings."
Social Studies,"And it's this idea that they should be these objective arbiters of what the truth is, of what is constitutional and what is not. What does a law actually mean? But we know in reality, these are human beings. And no matter how unbiased and no matter how objective they try to be, they still bring to the table their views and their experiences. And so even though this seems like a very clean process, there's definitely a large degree of subjectivity here."
Social Studies,"And because the executive branch, in particular the president, can appoint Supreme Court justices, there's definitely examples in history of changes in politics having long-term effects on changes in the Supreme Court. For example, a significant case of overturning precedent happens from 1896 to 1954. In 1896, you have the Plessy v. Ferguson case that we covered in several other videos, where the then Supreme Court rules its laws that involve segregation are okay."
Social Studies,"But then you fast-forward almost 60 years, and then the Supreme Court then, in Brown v. Board of Education in Topeka, ruled that no, separate but equal is not constitutional, that segregation is not okay. And this was influenced by this idea of, over time, you had presidents who were able to make judicial appointments to the Supreme Court as members of the Supreme Court died or retired, and went through a Senate confirmation process, and then these justices have life tenure."
Social Studies,"They can stay on the Supreme Court until they pass away or until they decide to retire. And so many historians would say that this overturning of precedent was due to a change in politics from the 1930s through the early 1950s. When you have several terms of FDR and then you have President Truman, who appointed justices to the Supreme Court that would eventually rule on Brown v. Board of Education, and they would be more pro-civil rights."
Social Studies,"And what's interesting about this is even though presidents try to appoints folks who they believe would maybe vote the way they would or have similar views, many times, it doesn't always work that way. For example, President Eisenhower, who was a Republican, appointed Justice Earl Warren, who was a Republican governor of California, but Warren ended up being famous for taking more liberal stances than not, including on Brown v. Board of Education.."
Social Studies,"They can also interpret the laws that have been passed. And so that's where they get their power. Now another interesting thing about the judicial branch that we've talked about is unlike the executive and legislative branch, where these folks are elected on a semi-regular basis, the Supreme Court, these are lifetime appointments. Once someone is nominated by the president and then confirmed by the Senate, they're in the Supreme Court for life."
Social Studies,"And so the question is is when the Supreme Court does something that say, the president or a member of Congress disagrees with, what can they do? Well, there's a couple of options here. One option, let's say that a clause of a law is deemed unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"So let's say that there's a law here and this part of it, the US Supreme Court says, ""No, that's not consistent with the Constitution,"" sometimes, the legislature might decide to, hey, let's try to pass another law that clarifies that clause in a way that is in line with the Constitution, or we'll do a whole other law that's worded different, but it has the same purpose."
Social Studies,"And so the legislative branch can't overrule the judicial branch, but they can try to revise their laws to get more in line with their intent but not get the negative judicial review. The president also has some levers. There's examples in history of the president just outright ignoring a judicial verdict."
Social Studies,"For example, Thomas Jefferson, during the Embargo Act during his administration, this is during the Napoleonic Wars, and those warring nations were taking advantage of American vessels and seamen, and Thomas Jefferson decided, hey, we don't want to have trade with those countries. There are aspects of those that the Supreme Court, including some Jefferson appointees, decided were unconstitutional but Jefferson just kind of kept executing the way he wanted to."
Social Studies,"You fast-forward a few decades to the beginning of the Civil War, President Lincoln decided that, hey, there's some people causing some trouble and we need to detain them, and we know there's a constitutional right of habeas corpus that says that people should be allowed to go to court to decide whether the detention is legal, to decide whether they should be detained, but President Lincoln decided to suspend habeas corpus in certain parts of the country, which the Supreme Court was not happy with."
Social Studies,"But he decided to just go ahead with it with the argument that it was necessary to preserve the Union. And perhaps the most famous example of a president not being happy with verdicts of the Supreme Court was FDR, as he took office in the midst of the Great Depression. There's a whole series of federal programs that he was trying to pass, and the Supreme Court started to strike down many of these, saying that, hey, this was not the role of the federal government, or this was overreaching by the executive."
Social Studies,"And so FDR was not happy with this, and so he actually proposed to the legislative branch the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which essentially said, hey, as soon as a Supreme Court justice is over 70 and a half years old, I should be able to appoint another Supreme Court justice, up to six, and it turns out there were exactly six justices who had already reached that age, so he essentially wanted to pack the Supreme Court with six new justices that would agree with him, that would allow him to do what he wanted."
Social Studies,"The legislative branch did not pass his Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, but some historians think that it had the impact that he wanted, because it seems, and we don't know for sure, after he even tried to do this, the judicial branch seemed more friendly to FDR. So maybe they said, ""Hey, you know, ""maybe we don't want to mess with this guy too much ""because eventually he might be successful."
Social Studies,"""Instead of having nine Supreme Court justices, ""we'll have 15."" People sometimes call this the switch in time that saved nine. But to get an appreciation of how people thought about it, I have some political cartoons from the time, and these are fun to just pause and take a look at it. So this says Trying to Change the Umpiring. So this is the Supreme Court, President Roosevelt here, and he's saying ""Listen. I don't like your decisions."
Social Studies,"""From now on, you're going to have to work with ""someone who can see things my way!"" and you can see all the different bats that he tried to use and they were all ruled out by the umpire. The NRA, the AAA, these are all different government institutions or programs that FDR was trying to set up in order to fight the Great Depression, as part of his New Deal. And they say, ""New Deal Acts declared unconstitutional."" I have another political cartoon right over here, and it's from that same period in time."
Social Studies,"Do We Want A Ventriloquist Act In The Supreme Court? And you see Uncle Sam here and then you have FDR, and it looks like he's got his hand controlling these puppets and it says, ""Yes, yes, we all vote yes!"" and even FDR did not get his way with his court-packing plan as it's sometimes called, let me write that down, his court-packing plan, as I mentioned, some historians believe that it did help influence the court being a little bit friendlier to him, and a somewhat irony of it is at the end of the day, because FDR served so many terms in office, he was able to make eight out of nine Supreme Court appointments."
Social Studies,"So in a lot of ways, he did determine the inclinations of the Supreme Court for many decades to come well after his administration.."
Social Studies,"Well, you could imagine a lot of women at the time who were citizens of the United States said that, ""Look, voting is a privilege of being a citizen, ""but I am not allowed to vote,"" and so you have Virginia Minor, who was a citizen in Missouri, decides to register to vote. She is denied and eventually takes the registrar to court."
Social Studies,"It eventually gets appealed all the way to the United States Supreme Court in Minor versus Happersett, where Happersett is the registrar in Missouri, and the Supreme Court in this case rules that voting is not a privilege of citizenship for women, and it seems absurd to us right now, that voting seems to be one of the main privileges of being a citizen, but that's the way the Supreme Court ruled in 1875. Now, the folks who were fighting for a women's right to vote weren't just women."
Social Studies,"They were also men, eventually started to have victories in the early 1900s at various states, especially states in the West, started to allow women to vote, but as we go into the teens of the 1900s, the movement gets enough steam to get Congress and the state legislators to propose and ratify the 19th Amendment, which says the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex."
Social Studies,"Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. So what we have here is the legislative branch, both the U.S. Congress and the state legislatures, because it needs to be voted for by 2/3 of both houses of Congress and then ratified by 3/4 of the states, they essentially overruled the Minor versus Happersett decision. They said, ""All right, Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"""You might see some ambiguity in the 14th Amendment,"" although today it's hard to say that voting isn't a privilege of citizenship, but to make it very clear, they proposed and ratified the 19th Amendment. So not only is this an interesting time in American history. Not that long ago, less than 100 years before this video that I'm making was made, women did not have the full right to vote most of the United States."
Social Studies,"We eventually get the 19th Amendment, but above and beyond that, this is an example of how other branches of government can exercise some checks on the Unites States Supreme Court.."
Social Studies,"This was a case around whether it was unconstitutional for an African-American in Louisiana to have to sit in a separate rail car from white passengers. Now, as you can imagine, this idea of segregation and separate but equal, it was taken to justify racial segregation in all walks of life, including in schools. And what you see here is a map of the United States, and it's colored in by the degree of school segregation, educational segregation, as we enter into the 1950s."
Social Studies,"And what you could see is in these red states here, which is for the most part the Southern states, it required the separation of races. In the green states you see here segregation was forbidden. And in the yellow and blue states it was kind of in between. The yellow states had no legislation, and in the blue states it was limited. It wasn't required. And all of this comes to a head as we get into the 1950s in Topeka, Kansas."
Social Studies,"You have a situation where the NAACP in coordination with 13 parents tried to register African-American students into white schools in Topeka, Kansas. The schools tried to prevent them, and it eventually goes to the United States Supreme Court in the case of Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka 1954. Oliver Brown was one of those 13 parents trying to get his daughter into an otherwise segregated school."
Social Studies,"And this is a seminal Supreme Court case because here the Supreme Court revisits segregation and essentially overturns Plessy versus Ferguson. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ruled, We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."
Social Studies,"Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. And we cite the 14th Amendment a lot in these Supreme Court cases. And it never hurts to take another look at at least an excerpt of the 14th Amendment. And this is a focus on the equal protection clause. This is part of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. And then this is the equal protection clause. Nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. And this is a big deal because not only does it say that hey, segregation is fundamentally unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"What's also interesting about this is that this unanimous ruling by the United States Supreme Court then sets off a whole series of actions by politicians from those states that you saw where segregation was mandatory to try to go around the Supreme Court's decision. And so it's a case of how other branches of government might try to limit Supreme Court powers or try to ignore, in some cases, Supreme Court powers. A good example of this was Virginia Senator Harry Byrd."
Social Studies,"In 1956, shortly after the Brown versus Board of Education decision, he issues the Southern Manifesto where he gets 100 politicians in the South to essentially sign on saying, hey, we are going to do what we can, legislatively, to try to get around the Brown versus Board of Education decision. We are going to try to ensure that that does not go into effect in segregated states like Virginia."
Social Studies,"And later that year, in 1956, it took the form of this massive resistance movement where they had the Stanley Plan, named after the Virginia governor in which they started to pass laws to try to make Brown versus Board of Education not take effect. One of them, for example, said that any school that actually desegregated would not receive state funds, and it authorized the governor to close those schools down."
Social Studies,"And this massive resistance continued, and it was challenged in the courts all the way to 1959 where you actually have the first integrated schools in the state of Virginia. Another state-level challenge to the ruling by the Supreme Court happened in 1957 where the governor of Arkansas, Orval Faubus, tried to actively prevent nine students, nine African-American students, from attending Little Rock Central High School."
Social Studies,"And so what you see in this picture over here, these are US Army troops sent by President Eisenhower to escort these nine students into Little Rock Central High School. These nine students are famously known as the Little Rock Nine. And this is actually a picture of Governor Orval Faubus later complaining about this intervention. And this continues on for some time. You fast forward to 1963."
Social Studies,"This is Alabama Governor George Wallace physically using himself to block two African-American students from registering at the University of Alabama. Once again, in this situation, the president had to take action. This time John F. Kennedy, he federalized the National Guard and he made them force Governor Wallace to step aside so that those students could register at the University of Alabama."
Social Studies,"So the big picture here is that Brown versus Board of Education is a seminal case in American history, but it also tells us how the legislative branch and state government might try to go around decisions that they don't like. Sometimes they might just ignore the decision until they're forced to pay attention to it. Or they might try to legislate their way around it and have a fight in the court system until they're forced to go one way or the other.."
Social Studies,"This is going to be a question from Senator Chuck Grassley, who's a Republican from Iowa, and he's going to be asking about whether marriage is a state or a federal question. - So, do you agree that marriage is a question reserved for the states to decide, based on Baker v. Nelson? - That also is a question that's pending and impending in many courts."
Social Studies,"As you know, the issue of marriage and what constitutes it is a subject of much public discussion, and there's a number of cases in state courts addressing the issue of who regulates it, under what terms-- - Can I please interrupt you? I thought I was asking a very simple question based upon a precedent that Baker v. Nelson is, based on the proposition that yesterday, in so many cases, whether it was Griswold, whether it was Roe v."
Social Studies,"Wade, whether it was Chevron, whether it's a whole bunch of other cases that you made reference to, the Casey case, the Gonzales case, the Leegin Creative Leather Products case, the Kelo case. You made that case to me. You said these are precedents. Now, are you saying to me that Baker v. Nelson is not a precedent? - No sir, I just haven't reviewed Baker in a while. And so, I actually don't know what the status is."
Social Studies,"If it is the court's precedent, as I've indicated in all of my answers, I will apply that precedent to the facts of any new situation that implicates it. Always, the first question for a judge-- - Well then, tell me what sort of a process you might go through-- - [Instructor] So anyway, you can see that this is not an easy process. And in this situation, you have an appointment by a Democratic president and you have questions from a Republican senator, and this is fairly typical."
Social Studies,"They're likely to ask more pointed questions and try to get the appointee to trip up. And if you were to see questions from a Democratic senator, they'd be more likely to ask questions that would make the nominee look a little bit better, and that tends to always be the case. If it's from the same party, they tend to try to smooth the process, while the opposition party tries to make it a little bit more difficult."
Social Studies,"And an interesting thing to think about is Justice Sotomayor eventually does get appointed to the Supreme Court, but what was the goal of Senator Grassley here in asking these questions, even if he knew that she was eventually going to be appointed? There's other themes that we've talked about in government that he might be playing to."
Social Studies,"He might be asking these questions more for his constituents or there might be an element of, even if a Supreme Court justice is going to be appointed, at the end of the day, there's also the court of public opinion, so to speak, and these might be opportunities to sow some seeds of doubt or to make it a little bit more difficult for a Supreme Court justice to, in the future, vote one way or another based on what they say during these hearings. Interesting things to talk about.."
Social Studies,"It can say that an executive action, say a rule or regulation or an executive order, is unconstitutional, but as it's doing that, as it's exercising its judicial review, how does it go about doing that? And this term judicial activism was first introduced by Arthur Schlesinger, who we've talked about in other videos, and it's meant to imply a judiciary that is not strictly just ruling based on maybe what the Constitution says but also their own personal ideas. So personal views."
Social Studies,"It sometimes has an implication that the judges are overreaching in some way. Some people might say, and this would be a little bit of a negative, ""legislating from the bench."" Legislating from the bench, and you'll often hear is that, ""Hey, that judge or that court is legislating ""from the bench,"" from the people who don't like their ruling. They're saying, ""Hey, they're not strictly looking ""at the law."
Social Studies,"""They're trying to make their own laws ""through their rulings."" Now some would say that it's necessary for the judicial to do this because they are interpreting the Constitution in the world as it is, and the world that we are in changes over time. So it is really a form of positive activism, that they are defending liberties, that they are defending rights, especially in the social context that we're in. I'll leave you to decide whether you think this is a good idea or not."
Social Studies,"Now judicial restraint is the opposite of it. This is a situation where the judges or the courts limit their power, so limit their own power, their own power, where they say, ""Hey, look, our job is to just be the umpire or the referee."
Social Studies,"""Our job is not to make new rules, ""and so we are just going to strictly think ""about whether something is constitutional ""or whether it is not,"" and one of the most seminal cases on judicial activism versus judicial restraint happened in the early 1960s, and that is the case of Baker versus Carr, and so what happens is is that Baker is a resident of Shelby County, Tennessee."
Social Studies,"He was actually of the former mayor of a town outside of Memphis, which is in this area right over here, and he says that, ""Look, the state is not reapportioning ""its legislative districts the way it should be,"" that in general every 10 years there is a census, and based on that, we have been understanding of where the population sits, and then the state should be reapportioning districts based on population, but what Baker argued is is that the state of Tennessee actually did not redistrict since 1901, after the census of 1900, and it was now the early 1960s, and he says because of that, and he invoked the 14th amendment, you weren't getting equal protection, that people in his county that had gotten increasingly urban and had gotten increasingly dense over the course of those 60 years, that they were getting the same representation despite having a larger population than some of the rural areas where they have a lower population and had the same number of representatives, and so he takes this case against the Secretary of State of Tennessee at the time, who was Carr, and it eventually gets to the Supreme Court, and the essential question in Baker versus Carr is whether the courts even have jurisdiction over legislative districting because the districting was a power of the state legislature in Tennessee, and in this case, the United States Supreme Court actually did vote in favor of Baker."
Social Studies,"So not only did they say that Baker was right in asking for this redistricting, it had huge implications in saying that, yes, courts, like the United States Supreme Court, do have jurisdiction over something that was officially a legislative duty, telling the legislative that, ""Look, you've got to do this 'cause ""by not doing this action, ""by exercising your discretion there, ""you might not be allowing everyone to have ""equal protection."" Many have argued, including the two dissenters to the opinion that this was a form of judicial activism."
Social Studies,"It increased the power of the judiciary, and to appreciate the view of the United States Supreme Court that they do have jurisdiction over legislative districting, here is part of Associate Justice Douglas's concurring opinion. ""Where the performance of a duty is left to the discretion ""and good judgment of an executive officer, ""the judiciary will not compel the exercise ""of his discretion one way or the other..."
Social Studies,"""for to do so would be to take over the office...."" So he's saying, look, when it is someone's job where there's an executive officer to do this duty, then the courts should not have jurisdiction there, but then he goes on to write, ""There is no doubt that the federal courts have jurisdiction ""of controversies concerning voting rights."
Social Studies,"""The Civil Rights Act gives them authority ""to redress the deprivation under color of any state law ""of any right, privilege or immunity secured ""by the Constitution of the United States ""or by any Act of Congress providing ""for equal rights of citizens...."" Really saying that, look, if the court can see that some right is being violated, some right is described in any under the state law, under the United States Constitution, then the courts do have jurisdiction."
Social Studies,"""The right to vote in both federal ""and state elections was protected ""by the judiciary long before that right received ""the explicit protection it is now accorded."" So he's saying, look, even before the Civil Rights Act, even before the 14th amendment, that this was something that was part of the charter of the judiciary, part of the federal court system, and so it does lean in favor of judicial activism because you can imagine courts, and they have cited Baker versus Carr since the 1960s repeatedly as reason, saying, hey look, we're trying to protect people's rights, and people have a right to do X, Y, or Z, even if it hasn't been explicitly legislated."
Social Studies,"Now there were two dissenters, and this is what the dissenters wrote. ""The courts authority--possessed of neither of the purse ""nor the sword..."" So here, the purse, that's the legislative branch that can think about budgets or the sword, that's the executive branch. The president's the commander in chief. ""Ultimately rests on sustained public confidence ""in its moral sanction."" Let me underline that. ""On sustained public confidence in its moral sanction."
Social Studies,"""Such feeling must be nourished ""by the Court's complete detachment, ""in fact and in appearance, ""from political entanglement and by abstention ""from injecting itself into the clash ""of political forces in political settlements."" So here, Associate Justice Frankfurter, in his dissenting opinion, is saying, look, we should stay out of this, that not only is it not our part to rule here, to say that, hey look, the legislative needs to do this redistricting again."
Social Studies,"He's saying that it actually undermines the credibility of the court, that the credibility ""ultimately rests on sustained public confidence ""in its moral sanction,"" and that by ruling in favor of Baker the court was overstepping of these bounds, that people would say, hey, you're starting to legislate from the bench."
Social Studies,"You're trying to get involved in the political, even though the court is supposed to stay above the fray of the political, or another way to think about this is that Associate Justice Frankfurter subscribed to the idea of judicial restraint and felt that the other six justices that were voting in favor of Baker were practicing to some degree judicial activism. They were getting into the territory of the other branches of government.."
Social Studies,"What exactly was the outline for how the country is supposed to behave and are we staying within that outline and those series of ideals? It goes back to the very beginning ingredients of America. So, the court is a test always of whether what we're doing now is in keeping with what we were supposed to do at the founding of the country."
Social Studies,The reason it has become so important recently is that the court ends up doing a lot more than it was ever supposed to do because of weakness in the executive branch and the legislative branch and so a lot of people are now looking to the court to solve problems that should actually be handled by the people's representatives. The judges are not elected.
Social Studies,"They are in there for life at the Supreme Court through the process of the president with advice and consent by the Senate but they are not elected and this was supposed to be a republic in which the elected representatives were the ones making the laws. But we've shifted away from that and so the court is now making decisions that can affect people's lives and a generation and not be changed as easily as say a piece of legislation which can be vetoed, amended, superseded by another piece of legislation."
Social Studies,It's really permanent changes in the American life. - So my understanding is that the Supreme Court should be above politics. To what degree is that actually the case? - Well the Supreme Court had lots of... There have been times where the Supreme Court when Andrew Jackson was president he tried to use the Supreme Court to do what he wanted it to do and Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to change the functioning of the court because it kept knocking down all the things he wanted to do.
Social Studies,"We've had moments where there have been these spasms where presidents have tried to get the court to do what they wanted. But in general, it was the American tradition that the justices were supposed to be picked if they were of good character and if they were of sound legal mind. If they had views on the manners related to the Constitution that were sort of sound legally. But their politics weren't supposed to be so important."
Social Studies,"What has happened is like so much in modern American life is there has been an intertwining of politics and the legal profession so that now when presidents run for office they say, elect me so that I can put in our kinds of judges. Which means that the kind of judge you pick helps you with your voters and if your voters want a very specific kind of ideological judge, then the more ideological the judge that you pick, the greater your voters will be happy about you and that'll keep you in office."
Social Studies,"And that is true of the senators advising and consenting on these decisions and true of the presidents who pick them. Well that means that the people who go into the office into the Supreme Court I should say end up being more political than in the past. There was a period where when an American president would pick a justice, that justice very often would rule in a way that was totally the opposite of what the members of that president's party wanted."
Social Studies,"It happened repeatedly in American life and that was a symbol people thought of the idea that these issues before the court were being weighed on their merits and had nothing to do with the ideological views of the judge weighing them. Now, where you sit on a particular issue is often determined by where you came from politically.."
Social Studies,"So I encourage you to pause this video and just make a guess. How many employees do you think each of these branches have, or more importantly, which of these do you think is the biggest? Well to answer your question, the great majority of federal employees are within the executive branch. We're talking about a very large number of people. If you don't include soldiers, we are still talking about more than 2.5 million people under the executive branch."
Social Studies,"If you include soldiers then we're starting to approach closer to four million people under the executive branch. So what you see on this org chart is that most of it sits under the executive. That's because the executive branch is charged with running the government. So you have the familiar roles, the president, the vice-president, the executive office of the president. Then you have the various cabinet departments right over here, and I could move to the left and the right so you can see them."
Social Studies,"Things like the Department of Agriculture, Department of Interior, Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, Department of Defense, Education, State, on and on and on and on. Then within each of these departments they can be quite, quite large. You could be talking about thousands or in some cases even tens of thousands of employees. But it's not just about those departments."
Social Studies,"If we go further down in this diagram right over here, you see independent establishments and the government corporations that are under the executive branch. Things like the United States Postal Service, the Peace Corps, you have the Federal Reserve system. These are all under the executive branch. When you take all of these things in total together it's known as the federal bureaucracy. Now the word bureaucracy might conjure up some images for you."
Social Studies,"You might imagine going to some type of a government office and trying to apply for something and then having to fill out a bunch of paperwork, or sit in line and then wait for something. And so sometimes it gets a bad name. Even the word bureaucratic tends to mean something that is a lot of process and not necessarily something that moves quickly or moves efficiently."
Social Studies,"But it's worth noting that even though a lot of people, we like to pick on the bureaucracy, and it is worth debating on how efficient government is at certain things, we do need some form of a bureaucracy. Without a government bureaucracy you would not have experts checking on whether your food is safe, checking on which drugs actually work."
Social Studies,"You would not have thoughtful people who are thinking about how do we run our military, how do we determine how we engage with other countries? So we do need a federal bureaucracy. These are the folks that are doing things like writing and enforcing regulations. They're issuing fines if you have bad actors, maybe a corporation that is polluting where they're not supposed to."
Social Studies,"Now where do these people come from? Well a lot of times the heads of these various departments, say the Secretary of Defense, who's at the top of the Department of Defense, or the Secretary of State, they are political appointees, they are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, we talk about that in other videos. But the great majority of the bureaucracy does not come from what is known as political patronage."
Social Studies,"Political patronage is, ""Hey, you really helped me with my campaign ""and I think you're a pretty decent person, ""I'm gonna give you a plum job ""at the top of the bureaucracy."" And even the word plum job, you should maybe take it with a grain of salt because some of these jobs do require a lot of responsibility. But the great majority of the bureaucracy is not from political patronage, but it's actually merit-based."
Social Studies,"These are folks, they might take the civil service exam, they might have graduate degrees in something that's relevant, let's say if they're working in the Food and Drug Administration they might know a little bit about chemistry or biology and will often, and no organization is perfect, oftentimes people get promoted for the wrong reason, but for the most part they're going to be promoted based on merit. So it's completely reasonable for us to debate how large this bureaucracy should be."
Social Studies,"For sure our federal bureaucracy is sometimes inefficient, but we do need it, and we're talking about millions of people, many of whom are experts in their field, who are really just trying to help us run our government.."
Social Studies,"So let's say that there is a group that is very interested in building more roads. Maybe there's a group that represents all the road contractors in the United States, and they would love more highways to be built because there'd be more business for them. And so then that interest group, who wants more highways to be built, they might say, hey, congresspeople, we want more highways built. The way that they try to get favor with Congress is through electoral support."
Social Studies,"Now what kind of electoral support could they give? Well, they could donate money to the congressmen directly. They could donate money to political parties. They could try to activate the electorate to vote for a congressperson who favors their agenda more than someone else. In exchange, congresspeople could do a few things. They could provide more funding to the bureaucracy that is going to build roads, and we just talked about that bureaucracy in the executive branch."
Social Studies,"That bureaucracy, not only might they build more roads, but if they like those interest groups, they might lower their regulations on them. They might give them more contracts as they build those roads. Another thing that Congress could do for the interest group is pass friendly legislation. So maybe pass a law that makes it easier to build roads in a certain part of the country or in a certain way. But the reason why it's called an iron triangle, it's not just about what do interest groups want."
Social Studies,"It's also what does Congress want? What does the bureaucracy want, and what do they get from the other two parties? So we already talked about how Congress can get electoral support from interest groups, but what can it get from a bureaucracy? Congress passes laws and a budget, but a bureaucracy, for the most part, decides how to execute on that. And so if they are aligned with Congress, they might execute on those laws with a little bit more energy."
Social Studies,"If the bureaucracy, for one reason or another, is not as gung ho about those laws, they might drag their feet a little bit. And from the bureaucracy point of view? Well, we already talked about how they could get funding and political support from Congress. You see that on that part of the triangle there. What do they get from the interest groups? Well, we already talked about the congressional support, which they can do by supporting congresspeople who might support favorable policies for the bureaucracy."
Social Studies,"The interest groups might be able to directly lobby Congress, which means, hey, we're going to meet with Congress. We might even draft some things for the policy agenda. Now a related idea to an iron triangle in interest groups that you might also hear in an American government course is the notion of issue networks. One way to think about issue networks is they are essentially more informal than interest groups."
Social Studies,"Interest groups can be part of an issue network, but an issue network can be, let's say, you and I start to get really activated about something we get on TV, and then we start mailing our congresspeople, and we start blogging about it, and we start getting a following, and then that starts to influence an interest group. Or an interest group joins with us, and then we start to send messages to Congress. We start to provide more scrutiny on the bureaucracy."
Social Studies,"Then we would be an issue network, and as I mentioned, issue networks might not be formal. They might not be a formal, let's say, lobbying group or interest group, but they can also have influence in the same way that an interest group does.."
Social Studies,"But the question is is how is this law actually implemented? And you might guess that that is the work of the bureaucracy, and we've already talked about the bureaucracy in multiple videos already. The bureaucracy is part of the Executive Branch. It's actually the bulk of federal employees. And as we'll see, as part of this implementing process, the bureaucracy has authority on rulemaking and it also has discretionary authority. Let me write that down."
Social Studies,"So the bureaucracy, bureaucracy, is going to implement the law, and they have different types of authority to do so. They have rulemaking authority, where for specific circumstances, they must say, ""Hey."
Social Studies,"This is how it's going to work,"" that the law itself does not specify it, but based on what that law is trying to do, they are going to set some rules, and as we'll see, the people working inside the bureaucracy, many of whom are experts on whatever policy they are trying to implement have some discretion on how they actually implement this law. So their authority, sometimes you'll hear rulemaking authority and discretionary authority."
Social Studies,"And as an example of that, we can look at what is often known as Title IX. So this right over here is Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972."
Social Studies,"It passed through Congress and then was signed into law by President Nixon, and it says, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, ""be excluded from participation in, ""be denied the benefits of, ""or be subjected to discrimination ""under any education program or activity ""receiving Federal financial assistance."" So this gets through the legislature, President Nixon signs it, becomes a law, but then how does this thing actually get implemented? And so this, as we've already talked about, is the job of the bureaucracy."
Social Studies,"And it's not just one department. Many departments of the federal government are going to have to think about how do they implement this statute right over here? And as an example of how, say the Department of Education thought about it, I'll give you a little bit of an excerpt from their rules and regulations. So this right over here is part of the rules and regulations from the Department of Education in their attempt to implement Title IX."
Social Studies,"And as I really think about what part of this really shows the bureaucracy's rulemaking authority and what part shows its discretionary authority? ""Every application for Federal financial assistance ""shall as condition of its approval contain ""or be accompanied by an assurance from the applicant ""or recipient, satisfactory to the Assistant Secretary, ""that the education program or activity ""operated by the applicant or recipient ""and to which this part applies will be operated ""in compliance with this part."" So that is a mouthful."
Social Studies,"I will help you parse it a little bit. So in this document, the term applicant and recipient, these are the institutions that are either applying for federal assistance or have already received financial assistance and it's saying every application for Federal financial assistance shall as condition for its approval contain or be accompanied by an assurance from the applicant or recipient. So the big picture."
Social Studies,"This whole thing is a rule that is being set up by the Office of Civil Rights within the Department of Education. So it clearly shows rulemaking authority. And this is just one part of a much, much larger document full of rules on how just the Department of Education is thinking about Title IX. And these things have the rule of law, even though every detail here has not been passed through Congress."
Social Studies,"Of course, Congress will have forms of oversight over this and the Supreme Court can also deem certain rules or regulations to be unconstitutional if it thinks they are unconstitutional. Now another thing in this clause right over here that I just read, you might have noticed, ""satisfactory to the Assistant Secretary."" So it's the Assistant Secretary's discretion as to whether an institution has met the requirements. So once again, this shows the discretionary authority of the bureaucracy."
Social Studies,"So the big takeaway here is it is the Legislative Branch that is responsible for passing laws, and then you have the president that would sign something into law, but once it's a law, but there's a lot of details to be worked out in terms of how it's implemented, and that is the job of the bureaucracy. And in order to do that, they make rules and regulations, and those rules and regulations also have the force of law."
Social Studies,"And top of that, there's going to be opportunities for them to exercise their discretion.."
Social Studies,"You have the executive branch with the President at the head of the executive branch. And of course you have the judicial. Now what we're going to focus on in this video is in previous videos we've talked about that the executive branch is in charge of running the government while the legislative branch, they're the folks who either write laws or control the budget. Now what we're going to do in this video is dig a little bit deeper in terms of how does Congress have oversight over the executive branch."
Social Studies,"When we think of the executive branch, we often think of the President or maybe the people who work around the president. But the federal bureaucracy is roughly 2.8 million people, and we talk about that in other videos. And so, how do we have oversight over these 2.8 million people? Well first of all, there is a whole managerial structure within the executive branch, but on top of that, you have the legislative branch having oversight over the executive agencies. Over these 2.8 million people."
Social Studies,"And there's two primary means of this oversight. The first one is Congress sets the budget. This is often known as power of the purse. And if Congress doesn't like how a certain agency is spending its money, they might reduce the budget there. If they really think that some agency's doing a good job or needs more resources, they might give them more resources in the next budget. The other tool of oversight that Congress has is committee hearings. And we have talked about this in other videos."
Social Studies,"But this is where the appropriate committee within Congress, it might be within the Senate or the House of Representatives, will call in leaders from the executive agency that they are overseeing to ask them questions. Hey, why did this not go as we planned? Or how do you deal with this situation? Or why are you spending more money than we thought you were actually going to spend? Now, to be clear, this is not always going to work."
Social Studies,"When we're talking about 2.8 million people, there definitely might be things that go on within these executive agencies that Congress, of course, will not have complete control of with just these two levers. Or they might not even know all of the details. But they try to do the committee hearings in order to get a reasonable understanding of what's going on and then leverage their budgetary powers in order to have some level of oversight."
Social Studies,"Now to get a feel for what this looks like, I'm about to show you an example of a Senate committee hearing. And this is a committee hearing where they brought in some folks from the FBI. And what's interesting about this one, this is not about national security. This committee hearing is about relocating or where they put the Federal Bureau of Investigation agency buildings. And you can see that there's definitely a tone of oversight in this video. - Mr."
Social Studies,"Matthews, I'm having a hard time accepting what you're saying here. So I'ma be perfectly blunt about that. You now say a major reason for terminating the original prospectus was that the transfer of the Hoover Building, something that you all wanted, and we didn't want. Congress didn't like that idea. But you said it was something you needed to do to get it done. So now we're supposed to believe that's the reason why you terminated for something that you wanted."
Social Studies,"Secondly, the consolidation, one of the major reasons for the consolidation on costs is to save rental costs. That's what you've told us all along. That it's more expensive to have places outside of the central location. And now you're saying it's a wash. Can you understand why I'm hanging a hard time accepting the information you're presenting? - Yes, Senator. So with respect to your first question, the issue-- - And quickly 'cause I heard-- we have your written statement on the transfer of the buildings."
Social Studies,"I agree with you on the transfer of the building. Didn't makes sense. But you insisted on it. - Well I would say personally I came here in August. - Your agency insisted on it in the prospectives that they submitted, they insisted that this be part of the deal. - Yes, they did, and I suggest that was a mistake. - And I've suggest that the information you're giving us right now maybe likewise a mistake.."
Social Studies,"The next four amendments in the Bill of Rights deal with protections for people accused of crimes and again, you see the legacy of the Revolutionary War and the idea that the Crown had had too much power to persecute individuals, so this includes things like the right to due process, that is to make sure that all the steps of following the law are taken, a ban on being tried twice for the same crime, rights to a speedy and public trial, a jury of your peers, to even have a jury in cases, that don't have to do with violent crimes, but rather civil disputes and a ban on excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment, basically this is a guarantee that the government will respect the rights of individuals."
Social Studies,"Now, one of the arguments made against including a Bill of Rights in the Constitution was that listing out those rights might then mean that they were the only rights and that by listing out these rights in particular, they might be forfeiting their liberties in other ways, so the ninth and tenth amendments attempt to deal with that worry, they say in the ninth amendment, any right that isn't listed here is still retained by the people, so this is not an exhaustive list, this is not the complete list of all the rights retained by the people and the tenth amendment is slightly different, but kind of on the same line, they say that if this Constitution has not delegated a right directly to the federal government, then that right is reserved to the states or the people, so the federal government can only do the things that are listed in this Constitution, it is a limited government, limited by this document."
Social Studies,"On the other hand, the rights of the people are unlimited, so if the Constitution doesn't say that the federal government can do it, that's then a right of the states or the people.."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the First Amendment, I talked to two experts. Erwin Chemerinsky is the Jesse H. Choper distinguished professor of law and dean of Berkeley Law. Michael McConnell is the Director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Professor Chemerinsky, there is a lot going on in the First Amendment."
Social Studies,Can you tell us a little bit more about why the framers chose to protect these rights in particular? - [Erwin] The historical background of the First Amendment of the Constitution shows why the framers wanted to be sure that all of the liberties in the First Amendment were safeguarded. Let's focus on freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
Social Studies,"In England, there was, after the printing press developed, licensing so that anyone who wanted to be able to publish anything needed to have a license from the government. As such, licensing was seen to be inconsistent with freedom of speech, freedom of the press; for that matter, freedom of thought, freedom of inquiry."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, okay, so there are a lot of essential freedoms that are packed into this First Amendment, so much that it's almost amazing that we're gonna attempt to talk about them all in one video. But if we dial in to freedom of speech, Professor McConell, what is freedom of speech? Does that encompass some things and not others? - [Michael] Well freedom of speech was actually less important to the framers than the freedom with which it was coupled, which was the freedom of the press."
Social Studies,"The reason for this is that speech that can reach large audiences is much more important to the individual but also dangerous to the state, than mere speech. When you speak, only those people within hearing range can hear you, but when you are able to use Gutenberg's fantastic new technology to publish your sentiments and distribute them widely, maybe even over the entire country or across the Atlantic, reaching hundreds of thousands of people. Now that is powerful."
Social Studies,"You think about how the American Revolution was won. This required spreading the word, it required gaining converts and telling people what their grievances were. To a very great extent this was done through the mechanism of the printing press."
Social Studies,"- [Erwin] When you ask the question, ""What's freedom of speech?"" there's implicit within it the issue of, 'What do we mean by speech?' Ultimately, the answer to your question is that the First Amendment, in protecting speech, broadly safeguards a right to express one's ideas. But it's not absolute. The government can restrict expression if there's a compelling interest."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, can you say more about that? - [Erwin] The Supreme Court always has been clear that freedom of speech is not absolute. The Court has said that there are certain categories of speech that are unprotected by the First Amendment. Incitement and illegal activity is a category of unprotected speech. The Court has said this requires showing that the speech was directed at causing imminent illegal activity, and there is a substantial likelihood of imminent illegal activity."
Social Studies,"Another example: obscenity is unprotected by the First Amendment. The Court struggled for years with trying to define, 'What is obscenity?' Maybe the low point in that is when Justice Potter Stewart said, ""I can't define it, but I know it when I see it."" There are also these categories of speech where the government can prohibit, even punish the expression."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] That's where most of the limitations on the freedom speech and of the press come from, is in order to make sure that we don't hurt other people's rights through the use our own. An example of that, the government can prohibit speech which incites violence against someone. So if you're making a speech and calling upon the crowd to attack somebody's house or their person, that can be punished and prevented as an incitement to violence."
Social Studies,"You can see how that follows from the logical idea of freedom of speech being a natural right, and therefore limited by the rights of other people. - [Kim] So let's turn our attention toward the freedom of religion part of the First Amendment. So the first thing that the Amendment says is about establishment. What does the Establishment Clause prevent? - [Erwin] The language of the First Amendment is important, it says that Congress may make no law respecting the establishment of religion."
Social Studies,Since 1947 the Supreme Court has said that that also applies to state and local governments. The Supreme Court has said this means that the government cannot act with the purpose of advancing religion.
Social Studies,"- [Michael] To the founders, this was a very clear legal concept, namely it was the established Church of England that in the statute books, in the law, the Church of England was referred to as, and I quote, ""The Church by law established."" What did it mean to be established? First of all, it meant that the doctrines of the Church, the 39 Articles of Faith of the Church of England, were voted upon by parliament. So the doctrines, the liturgy, the text, were all adopted by law."
Social Studies,"The established Church was the government's church, and it could be used, and from time to time was used, as a instrument of government or as an instrument of politics. This is a way in which the government is able to have a powerful influence on the way in which values and opinions are inculcated."
Social Studies,"It's one of the most important ideas of the established church, especially in the 18th century, was to teach that there's actually a religious obligation to obey the law and to recognize the king as the supreme leader in matters of both church and state. The framer's experience with this was extremely powerful. - [Erwin] That's because the framers were aware of the religious persecution that had gone on in other countries."
Social Studies,"They were aware of the evils that occur when the government becomes aligned with a particular religion. - [Michael] The principal reason why many of the colonists had come to these shores to begin with was to escape the oppressions of the established Church of England back home, and to come to a place where they would be able to exercise the freedom of religion for themselves. The main opponents of the established church were not anti-Christian or anti-religious people."
Social Studies,"They were the most religious people, and their view was the government should stay our of our church, that we will decide what we believe for ourselves, we will control our own church, we will write our own liturgy, we will decide what version of the Bible we're going to use, we'll choose our own ministers. Thank you very much government, stay out of it. Leave us free to practice our religion without having this kind of an establishment."
Social Studies,"- [Erwin] For instance, a county in Kentucky required that the Ten Commandments be posted in all county buildings. The Supreme Court said, ""The Ten Commandments ""are religious scripture. ""There's no secular purpose for having the Ten Commandments ""posted in county buildings."" The Court declared it unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has said, ""The government can't act ""where there primary effect ""is to advance or to inhibit religion."" For example, there can't be prayer in public schools."
Social Studies,"Even voluntary prayer in public schools in impermissible, because the Court has said that the primary effect of having prayer in public schools is to advance religion. The Court has explained that children will inevitably feel pressure to participate, and this coercion violates the Constitution. - [Kim] So, the First Amendment then prevents that kind of intermingling of the government and the church."
Social Studies,"This is I guess the key idea of separation between church and state, but it also says that the Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. So what does that mean? - [Michael] Free exercise of religion was the right to practice your own religion."
Social Studies,"It didn't keep the government from setting up a church, but it did keep the government from requiring you to attend that church, maybe even to contribute to the church, but also kept the government from preventing you from worshiping elsewhere. So the Establishment Clause by and large prevents the government from forcing people to participate in religion, and the Free Exercise Clause by and large prohibits the government from preventing people from practicing their religion."
Social Studies,"Those two things work together to enable everyone to worship God in accordance with their own conscience. - [Kim] Interesting. So you mentioned a little bit about freedom of the press, but there are two other aspects of the First Amendment: the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government of a redress of grievances."
Social Studies,"So what is included with the right to peaceably assemble? Are there any situations where that might be restricted? - [Erwin] The Supreme Court has said that under freedom of speech, there's a right to use government property for speech purposes. This is also something that tells the freedom of assembly. The Supreme Court has said there's certain government properties that the government is required to make available for speech: sidewalks and parks."
Social Studies,"There's other places where the government has more latitude to regulating speech: school facilities, evenings and weekends. There's places where the government can close entirely to speech: military bases, areas outside prisons and jails. All of these cases could have been litigated under freedom of assembly. Some of the earlier cases explicitly mentioned freedom of assembly, but subsequent cases combined freedom of assembly into the protection of freedom of speech."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] I guess that makes sense, But what about something like a march, for example, that might, say, block traffic. That's perhaps a clear case when there is this tension between freedom of speech and assembly and say, public safety, if they're blocking, say, an ambulance."
Social Studies,"How do you resolve that tension? - [Michael] Sometime in roughly the 1970s, the Court began using a quite different way of looking at the free speech question, in which they said that laws which regulate or prohibit speech on the basis of the content of the speech are, generally speaking, unconstitutional, absent a very important governmental purpose. But the laws that are content neutral, and regulate speech from a basis of it's time, place, or manner are permitted."
Social Studies,"So the basic idea here is the government has regulatory authority over speech, but not over what you say. Just over when you say it, where you say it, how you say it. - [Kim] So, the last thing in the First Amendment is the phrase ""petitioning the government ""for a redress of grievances."" Congress shall make no law abridging that freedom."
Social Studies,What does this mean? How would one petition the government for a redress of grievances? - [Erwin] There are of course many ways that people can petition government for redress of grievances. It's the ability to go and testify before our legislative body. It's the ability to communicate with one's leglislators or representatives about change. It's basically the ability to go to the government and ask it to change its policy.
Social Studies,"There are relatively few cases just about the right to petition government for redress of grievances. Again, I think the reason for that is, it's been so subsumed into the protection of freedom of speech. Everything one would do by way of petitioning government for redress of grievances is through speech and expression, and so the larger protection of speech and expression has meant that the Court hasn't needed to focus so much on this particular right."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Is there anything that you feel people commonly misunderstand about the First Amendment, what it encompasses and what it does not? - [Erwin] One of the most important misunderstandings about this First Amendment, is that people fail to realize that it, like all rights in the Constitution, apply only to the government. Before I took my current job, I was a professor at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Duke is a private university."
Social Studies,"If while I was there, I had criticized the president of the university, and he would have ordered me fired, I could not have sued him or Duke University for violating my free speech rights. The First Amendment doesn't apply because it's a private university. Now I'm at the University of California, a state university. If I were to give a speech criticizing the president of the university, or the chancellor of my campus, and I was to be fired for doing that, I could sue."
Social Studies,"I would sue, because this is a public university. The First Amendment applies. - [Michael] So I think the really dangerous thing in our times is that many people believe that they have some kind of a right not to hear opinions that they find offensive. Certainly college campuses are filled with controversies of this sort. This is something that our Constitution was designed to prevent. Free speech can inflict offense."
Social Studies,"Sometimes it can be hurtful and insulting, but we as a nation have decided that it is better to put up with that so that we can all be free to express ourselves, to criticize the government, to urge the religious and scientific and artistic ideas that we have. It's more important for all of us to do that than it is to be able to retreat to safe spaces and require other people to shut up."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that the rights protected in the First Amendment derive from the historical context of restricted speech, press, and religion in Europe that the framers wished to avoid in the United States. Freedom of religion includes both the freedom not to participate in religion, and the freedom to practice whatever religion you choose. Freedom of speech extends to all forms of freedom of expression, not just words, but there are limits to what counts as free speech."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the First Amendment, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Second Amendment, I talked to two experts. Alan Gura is a lawyer who successfully argued two landmark Second Amendment cases before the Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"Adam Winkler is a professor at UCLA Law, and the author of ""Gunfight: the Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America."" Professor Winkler, why did the framers include an amendment on the right to keep and bear arms? - [Adam] Well, really, there's been some debate over what the meaning of the right to keep and bear arms is, but the most common view, and the view supported by the United States Supreme Court, is that the Second Amendment protects individual liberty, in particular, the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense."
Social Studies,"Back in the founding era, the framers were concerned about self-defense in terms of armed state militias, made up of common citizens who would prevent federal overreach. So the federal government wouldn't be able to run roughshod over the liberties of the people because of these armed state militias. So the Second Amendment was in part about protecting those armed state militias."
Social Studies,"Indeed the fear behind all of the Bill of Rights, was that the Constitution gave the new federal government too much power and the federal government would use that power to inhibit liberty. So that was the self-defense of the founding era."
Social Studies,"- [Alan] When we look at the text, the first thing that people should focus on is the phrase ""the right of the people,"" and, in particular, the word ""the"" before ""right,"" I think that might be actually the most important word in the amendment, because what it tells us, is that the right of the people, which is the subject of this amendment, is a pre-existing right."
Social Studies,"And the fact that this was a pre-existing right tells us that the framers thought that there was something that was out there, in their legal system, that they were preserving against violation, and in fact, that is the case."
Social Studies,"In English law, since well before the Revolution, it had been settled and determined that people had an individual right to have arms for self protection, and this right was understood to enable people to protect themselves both against criminal private violence as well as the right of people to protect themselves against some encroachment upon their liberties by a tyrant or by a misguided king."
Social Studies,"This was a right that the framers were well acquainted with in English law, and they were very perturbed that the British, during the time of the Revolution, were violating this right. There were various instances of the British disarming Americans, obviously in an attempt to keep the colonists from revolting, and in an attempt to prevent them from resisting the king."
Social Studies,"The Battle of Lexington and Concord, of course, which started the Revolution, was nothing but a British march upon the armories in those towns, and the attempt to suppress the right to arms. And so, what you saw was when the time came for a Bill of Rights, you saw five out of seven states propose a Bill of Rights, and the only provisions common in all the demands for a Bill of Rights, were the right to religious freedom and the right to arms."
Social Studies,"Now, the framers were not necessarily concerned about the sort of modern gun control, which is in controversy today. - [Adam] Today we have a different kind of self-defense, we generally think about with the Second Amendment, and that's about individuals defending themselves against criminals. It's a very personal kind of liberty, defending yourself against someone trying to take away your life, your health, your property, the life of your loved ones."
Social Studies,"And one thing that I think to remember is that this kind of change in the meaning of a constitutional amendment over time is very common among our constitutional rights. As we take the underlying principles that are embodied in the text, and we apply them to modern circumstances. - [Kim] What about in this early period with the Articles of Confederation."
Social Studies,"Did state constitutions also protect the right to bear arms? - [Alan] Yes, there were state constitutions that protected the right to bear arms, most notably the Pennsylvania Constitution, Article 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provided ""That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state."" And Vermont's Constitution, the following year, chapter one, article 15 copied that language, and you would see other late 18th century, early 19th century constitutions keep this language, or some version of it, and what you would notice is that this language, of course, talks about the two dimensions of the right to bear arms."
Social Studies,"The people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves, that can only be interpreted as self-defense, and also for the defense of the state, that is, they can use those arms that they individually have and gather together and work to defend the society from some force that's attacking them. - [Kim] This is really fascinating. My background is in U.S. history, and I know that one of the reasons that the framers decided that they needed a Constitution that would change the form of the U.S."
Social Studies,"government from what it had been under the Articles of Confederation, was Shays' Rebellion, when a group of armed farmers from western Massachusetts marched on Springfield. So they had kinda taken their military past as a militia, in the Revolutionary War, and then turned that against the new U.S. government instead of the British government."
Social Studies,"Did the framers have any reservations about trying to protect militias in light of Shays' Rebellion? - [Adam] The founders did have concerns about armed militias, as exemplified by Shays' Rebellion. They were worried about self-proclaimed militias, groups of, basically armed uprisings in disguise, that claimed the mantle of a militia, but were really just troublemakers who were taking up arms. And that was kind of how Shays' Rebellion was thought of at the time."
Social Studies,"And that's why when we think about the Second Amendment, we should focus on that language that the framers were sure to include, which is that the militias must be well regulated, right? So the Second Amendment itself says ""A well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" And so, they understood that there was a militia, common citizens who took up arms to help defend the state and nation."
Social Studies,"But they recognized that the militia must be well regulated, disciplined, orderly, subject to appropriate command. It wasn't a right for any self-proclaimed group of radicals to get together and grab their guns, it was, instead, a right to have an orderly state militia, which was an important source of national defense at the time of the founding era."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, I see that the Second Amendment and the Third Amendment, which bans the government from quartering soldiers in people's houses, both reflect fears about standing armies, and also the dangers of having very strong government military power."
Social Studies,"Today we have a very strong government military power, and a standing army, so to what extent are those concerns still relevant today? - [Alan] Well those concerns are still relevant today, we're very blessed in America that we have a long tradition of civilian control over the military, and in our culture the military has not been used to suppress the people, that's not been our experience, but it has been the experience, sadly, in many other places, including through today."
Social Studies,"Now, what the Second Amendment reflects is the notion that the government should not have a monopoly on force. There has to be some means that people might still retain the ability to act, to defend themselves, whether that's against a private individual, felon, miscreant, or whether it's against something more nefarious. - [Adam] Our understanding of what's necessary for national defense is very different than it was in the founding era, because our society is so much different."
Social Studies,"We don't have militias of ordinary citizens the way we once did, back in the founding era, and we don't have troops occupying peoples' homes the way the founders did. But nonetheless, I think the Second and Third Amendment both have principles embodied in that text that remain relevant for today, and should not be thought of as dead letters just because the particular concerns that gave rise to them no longer remain our concerns. Because the principles they embody are more important and more enduring."
Social Studies,"- [Alan] We have been blessed with peaceful transitions of power, with a vibrant democracy, perhaps, at least some aspect of our happy experience, relative to those of our friends and ancestors in Europe, is that we do have a culture that includes the widespread private arms. And that may have a beneficial effect in making sure that everybody plays by the rules and observes normal political conventions and norms."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So what are some of the major Supreme Court cases that have shaped our understanding of the Second Amendment? - [Adam] The first one was a case called ""United States versus Miller,"" that arose in the 1930s. In Miller, you had a situation where an individual was a gangster and he was caught with a sawed off shotgun, which at the time, and still now, does require a special tax stamp that Mr. Miller did not have, and he argued that the Second Amendment secured his right to this weapon."
Social Studies,"The government took the case to the Supreme Court, and at the conclusion of the somewhat confused opinion, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the district court for a determination as to whether or not the sawed off shotgun was an arm of the type whose possession is protected by the Second Amendment. Subsequently, Mr. Miller was murdered, so perhaps he needed a gun of some kind, after all, but we never got the answer to that question."
Social Studies,"So I would read that case, as other people do, and say ""Look, obviously the Supreme Court thought there was some individual right to arms."" If the court had held that there was no individual right to arms, it would have been a much simpler opinion, they would have just said so and that would've been the end of the matter. But instead, because more evidence was needed relating to whether or not this was an arm of the type that Mr. Miller could possess, that shows that there was some right there, at issue."
Social Studies,"Much more helpful, of course, is the case that I argued in the Supreme Court, D.C. versus Heller, which was a coherent, detailed fully briefed and exhaustively opined matter which struck down various Washington, D.C. gun control laws. The main laws at issue in Heller were a District of Columbia law that banned the possession of all handguns by people, effectively. And also, a law that prohibited people from having operative firearms in their home."
Social Studies,"You can have a long gun, a rifle or a shotgun, in your home in D.C., but you could never render that operational, for use as self defense inside your home. Oddly enough, you could use it in self defense in a place of business, just not at your home. - [Adam] The most important case on the Second Amendment is District of Columbia against Heller, where the court held, for the very first time, that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms and struck down a gun control law."
Social Studies,"That was a very important case, a landmark ruling, that has led to many, many, many court cases challenging the constitutionality of a wide number of gun control laws. The Supreme Court has not again stepped into the Second Amendment, with one exception, the court in a case called ""McDonald versus City of Chicago"" held that the Second Amendment applied equally to the federal government and to the state and local governments."
Social Studies,"One thing to remember about our constitutional rights is that they don't automatically apply to the state and local governments. But the McDonald case held that the Second Amendment, and the principles of the Second Amendment nonetheless apply to the states, as well. And that's pretty common as well, over the course of the 20th century the Supreme Court has held that nearly all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply equally to the state and local governments."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] How about limits on the Second Amendment? I mean, I couldn't own a tank, right? What sort of limits may the government place on the right to keep and bear arms? - [Alan] Well, the Second Amendment, like other rights, has some limitations. The first limitations are, of course, as with all rights, given to us by the scope of the actual rights. There are many things that simply aren't included in a particular right."
Social Studies,"The right of free speech, for example, guarantees you the right to speak in some ways, but perjury of speech, terroristic threats or speech, extortion is a form of speech, none of those are traditionally protected. And likewise, there are going to be some arms that are going to fall outside of Second Amendment protection. The Heller case tells us how to go about discovering those limits."
Social Studies,"The Amendment, we are told, presupposes that people will have arms that people would expect to find in common use for traditional, lawful purposes."
Social Studies,"And so, while a handgun or a rifle is a type of arm that people would keep for self defense, for hunting, for sport; a tank or a bazooka is usually not something that you would wish to access for some traditional, recognized, lawful activity, right? I mean, very few people would use a tank to defend themselves against a mugger on the street, right? - [Adam] I mean, as a matter of practicality, even if we didn't have a Second Amendment, there's no possible way we're going to disarm the entire civilian population."
Social Studies,"So, the guns are here to stay. The question is how can we exist with civilian armament and good and effective gun control? And I think that history and tradition can provide some of those answers. In the same way that we try to understand what does the text of the Constitution mean, and what are the principles that that text embodies, we look to history and tradition, how have Americans lived under that Constitution, over these 200-odd years."
Social Studies,We should also look to that history and tradition in seeing the limits of those constitutional rights. And one thing I think is very clear from the history and tradition of gun rights and gun regulation is that there's ample room to regulate firearms.
Social Studies,"The founding fathers had gun control laws, we had gun control laws in the wild west, even though that was the heart of America's gun culture, we've had gun control laws all through American history, and they're part of the story of the Second Amendment, as much as the six-shooter and the right to bear arms."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that the framers' concern over protecting the right to bear arms originated in the experiences of the American Revolution, in which militias played a central role in winning independence for the United States. But a lot has changed since the Revolution. The U.S. military has grown, and arms have gotten a lot more powerful. Alan Gura suggests that the lack of a government monopoly on force is a key component of the peaceful transitions of power that characterize American democracy."
Social Studies,"Adam Winkler, however, argues that there's always been some form of gun control in the United States, even in the wild west. To learn more about the Second Amendment, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"It says, ""This right of the people to be secure ""in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, ""against unreasonable searches and seizures, ""shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, ""but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, ""and particularly describing the place to be searched, ""and the persons or things to be seized."" To learn more about the the Fourth Amendment, I talked to two law professors who specialize in criminal law, Professor Tracey Meares of Yale University and Professor Orin Kerr of George Washington University, and he's a particular expert in criminal procedure and computer crime."
Social Studies,"Professor Kerr, can you tell us a little bit about what the Fourth Amendment is and why the Framers were interested in protecting these rights in particular? - [Orin] The Fourth Amendment is a ban on unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. It's something the Framers were interested in because they wanted to limit the government's power."
Social Studies,"At the time of the framing, the English King had engaged in some pretty bad things that the Framers wanted to stop, and one of those was raiding people's homes with what was called a general warrant. A general warrant was basically a warrant that said the police could go anywhere and look for anything without any limit. - [Kim] I asked Professor Meares to explain a little bit more about general warrants. She's a professor at Yale Law School who specializes in criminal procedure and criminal law policy."
Social Studies,"- [Tracey] They were a general warrant allowing these officials to search people's homes, places, papers, the kinds of things that the Fourth Amendment lists in ways that people thought was not okay. The Fourth Amendment was primarily concerned with a couple of things. One: a case involving a seditious libel investigation. It's a case called Entick."
Social Studies,"And a warrant was issued authorizing Entick, that's the subject of the warrant, his arrest, and the seizure of all of his books and papers so that he could be prosecuted for seditious libel."
Social Studies,"That case isn't as well-known as the second case, which is called the Writs of Assistance case, and basically, the Writs of Assistance involved customs inspectors who were trying to crack down on smuggling that was affecting Boston's economy, so to add in that task, inspectors used writs of assistance that were issued by the king and authorized the inspectors both to draft assistance, hence the name ""writs of assistance,"" and to search any place where smuggled goods might be concealed."
Social Studies,"- [Orin] The Framers wanted to put an end to that and so they said, ""No general warrants are allowed,"" and searches and seizures have to be reasonable. That really means is the government can't just stop anyone, arrest anyone, break into someone's house. There are limits as to what the government can do. - [Kim] But what are those limits? What determines probable cause for a search and what renders a search and seizure unreasonable? - [Orin] Yeah, what counts as unreasonable is a really big question."
Social Studies,"There are different answers different courts have suggested, but the basic idea is that first if the government has a valid warrant, a search or a seizure is reasonable. If the warrant, if a judge has signed off and said, ""Yeah, the government has probable cause ""to search this place for particular evidence,"" then the government can do that. And then the Supreme Court has laid out a bunch of what they call exceptions to the warrant requirement, which are also reasonable searches."
Social Studies,"So for example, if a person consents to a search, that's reasonable. Or in the case of a car, a car can be searched without a warrant based on probable cause. That's called the automobile exception. There are rules that govern when the police can stop somebody temporarily. When the government needs an arrest, they need probable cause. There are basically all sorts of rules that the Supreme Court has laid out on a bunch of different cases that say what counts as an unreasonable search or seizure."
Social Studies,"The Supreme Court has said that probable cause means a fair probability that evidence will be found in a particular place or that a particular person committed a crime, and ""fair probability"" is the language, but that's not something the Supreme Court has said. You know, that's not 50%. That doesn't mean it's more probable than not. It just means that there's pretty good reason to think that there's evidence to be in a particular place or that a particular person committed a crime."
Social Studies,"So it doesn't mean a hunch, it doesn't mean the officer just had the idea pop into his head, but it also doesn't mean that the officer's certain. There's just got to be a pretty good reason, but not certainty, to think that that person committed a crime or there's evidence there. - [Kim] But when I asked Professor Meares the same question, she wasn't convinced it was so easy to tell what counts as probable cause."
Social Studies,"So what counts as a true probable cause to issue a warrant upon? (Tracey sighs) (Kim laughs) Sorry. We can just skip this instead. - [Tracey] Let's take a second. I mean, I taught this today. You can't, these aren't questions that you can just simply answer. No one can actually. I mean, there is, I mean literally, I taught today the fact that there is no real law on what probable cause is. It's inherently a factual determination."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So how does this work in practice? I asked Professor Kerr if it's the case that a police officer has to convince a judge that there's probable cause to issue a warrant. - [Orin] Yes, that can come up in two ways. In some cases, the Supreme Court says the police have to go to a judge first and get a warrant and then they have to convince the judge that what they're about to do is based on probable cause."
Social Studies,"And other cases come up when the government has searched first or arrested first and then they come back with the evidence or come back with the person who was arrested and then there's a hearing as to whether there was probable cause for the arrest that already occurred, so either way the standards are the same. It's that fair probability idea, ultimately up to a judge whether the police were right or wrong in doing what they did."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, so there is a little bit of prior legwork involved in some cases. What happens in cases when it might be really important to get evidence, say if there's a bomb threat? - [Orin] So there are some rules that allow searches or seizures without a warrant under what they call exigent circumstances. That basically means there is an emergency, so the government had to act without a search warrant."
Social Studies,"And so if there is a ticking time bomb that they think is gonna go off in a package and they've got good reason to think there is this ticking time bomb in the package, they don't have to say, ""Hey, we're gonna go find a judge,"" because by the time they do that, the bomb might have gone off. They can search that package under this exigent circumstances idea."
Social Studies,"So that's an exception to the rules, although beyond that, there is no difference between a serious case and a less serious case under the Fourth Amendment. They're kind of all serious cases, so the courts have to follow and the police have to follow the same rules in less serious and more serious cases. - [Kim] Professor Meares gave me an example of what seemed like a less serious case, but it's still a really interesting example of what counts as an unreasonable search and seizure."
Social Studies,"- [Tracey] I'll give you one more case that I'm sure the high school students will love, and my students love it. It's a case where a person was sitting in a noddle shop in front of a window eating a big bowl of noodles, clear soup with noodles, and a police officer walks by the person eating the noddles and notices something floating in the bowl of noodles."
Social Studies,"So he enters into the store where the person is eating the noodles and the person has left temporarily the bowl of noodles to get a napkin or go to the bathroom or something. And then the police officer approaches the bowl, picks up the person's spoon and stirs the noodles to see if he can find anything and some baggies of crack float to the top. Did the person have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their food? - [Kim] In their soup? - [Tracey] In their soup."
Social Studies,"(Kim laughs) - [Kim] How did they rule? - [Tracey] They ruled that the stirring was a search. So if it is a search, and i.e., that you have a subjective interest of privacy in your soup that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable, then the police officer would have to get a warrant before stirring the soup. - [Kim] This raises the question."
Social Studies,"Where I have Fourth Amendment rights? Are some locations protected and not others? - [Orin] The building block of the Fourth Amendment is really that you have Fourth Amendment rights in your home, in your pockets, in your packages, but you don't have Fourth Amendment rights outside. You don't have Fourth Amendment rights in what you're doing outside or if the police want to walk on what they call open fields, public streets, that, you don't have Fourth Amendment rights in that."
Social Studies,"So thinking about how the Fourth Amendment applies just in the physical world, if the police want to break into your home, they need a search warrant. If the police want to watch you walk down the street, they don't need anything. It's not a search or a seizure, so they can do anything they want, just watching you. If they want to arrest you, they need probable cause to believe you've committed a crime. So those are really the building blocks of the Fourth Amendment going back to 18th-century technology."
Social Studies,"And then the big question becomes, ""All right. Well, how do you update that to a modern world?"" - [Tracey] It's also the case that the Fourth Amendment applies to seizures, so what police have to show before they arrest a person or temporarily stop them, or briefly pat their body on the outside of their body for weapons. All of those questions are Fourth Amendment questions, as are questions involving how much force police actually use to effect the arrest once we've decided that an arrest is legitimate."
Social Studies,"So we haven't talked about any of those questions but the Fourth Amendment governs all of that and remember, the Fourth Amendment governs all of those topics in a context in which the Framers' motivations for enacting the Fourth Amendment have absolutely nothing to do with most of those things I just mentioned. - [Kim] But the Fourth Amendment also has implications that go beyond warrants and seizures. Professor Meares thinks that one of the biggest Fourth Amendment issues today is discretion."
Social Studies,"- [Tracey] Many people have thought much more about how the Fourth Amendment protects privacy than how the Fourth Amendment addresses discretion. - [Kim] And by discretion in this case, you mean what they get to decide to do on their own, right? - [Tracey] Exactly so. And one way to see the difference between those two things is to think about a metal detector in an airport. So long as everyone is required to go through the metal detector, there is no law enforcement discretion involved."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this is kind of where the public safety aspect comes in, that if we're all subject to non-invasive procedures at the whim of police, it's a little different than if individuals are kind of plucked for that reason? - [Tracey] Right, that it's just pointing out that targeting, the targeting of people for invasions is a different problem than the invasion problem itself, right? And so if all we ever do is think about privacy invasion without thinking about the discretion problem, then we're missing something important."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] For Professor Kerr however, the most important issue at stake today regarding the Fourth Amendment is how it will apply to electronic media. - [Orin] Well, the big question I think is how the Fourth Amendment is gonna apply to searches and seizures of computers, of emails, to the internet, new technologies that we all use every day."
Social Studies,"We wake up in the morning and hop online or go on Twitter or whatever you use online, lots and lots of communications online all around the world, and how does the Fourth Amendment apply to that is something that the courts are beginning to answer but they've only started to answer. Some really, really hard questions of kind of translating that physical world concept of the Fourth Amendment to the world of computers that we live today."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, as we've learned, the Fourth Amendment ensures that government authorities can't raid homes, pockets, or papers without a warrant issued by a judge, and then only if there is a probable cause to believe there is a reason for a search. What's tricky is deciding what counts as probable cause and whether it's discriminatory to select some people to search, but not others."
Social Studies,"And how do we translate the Fourth Amendment to a world where our papers are all digital? Should the police be permitted to search our cell phones, our browsing histories, our private social media profiles? You can learn more about the Fourth Amendment by checking out the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"John Stinneford is the assistant director of the Criminal Justice Center at the University of Florida Law School. John Bessler is an associate professor of law at the University of Baltimore Law School. So, Professor Bessler, why were the framers so keen to include the 8th Amendment? Why did they wanna protect these rights in particular? - [John B.] Well, these rights were actually enshrined in the English Bill of Rights of 1689."
Social Studies,"And so, when the Americans got into the dispute with Great Britain, they decided they wanted to have the same rights that Englishman had. And so, it was not too surprising that when George Mason actually wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776, that he looked to English law to see what rights the English had because he wanted exactly the same rights."
Social Studies,"And so, this 16 words in the 8th Amendment have been subject to a lot of controversy over the years, but, I think, one of the reasons that the founders wanted this was that, like the English would have problems with the monarch imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, inflicting cruel and unusual punishments, the founders also knew that was a risk that there was abuse from the government in the United States. And so, they also wanted those rights."
Social Studies,"Because, originally, in the Constitution, these rights were not protected against, and the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 which ensured that there would be protections against these cruel and unusual punishments, and excessive bail and excessive fines. - [John S.] If you look at the 8th Amendment, there's three clauses, right? The excessive bail clause, the excessive fines clause, and the cruel and unusual punishments clause."
Social Studies,"And these all have one thing in common, which is that these are all penalties, essentially, that the government inflicts on people usually as the result of either being accused of crime or of being convicted of crime. So if you've been arrested, you're waiting for trial, very often your only way to get out of jail before trial is to make bail. And, of course, after you've been convicted, the court might impose a fine on you, or some other kind of punishment."
Social Studies,"And so, the 8th Amendment is designed to prevent the government from doing things that are excessive. When the government punishes a person, that's the most coercive thing the government does short of war, right? Other than shooting you in battle, picking you up and throwing you in a jail cell is about as bad as it gets. And so, the framers wanted to make sure that we had a constitutional protection when it comes to criminal punishment."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, in a lot of cases in the Bill of Rights you see the framers reacting to some historical evil that they hope to prevent. For example, the 3rd Amendment says you can't quarter soldiers in private citizens' homes because that had been such a important tipping point in the American Revolution."
Social Studies,"Was there something that the framers had in mind as a particular historical evil that they wanted to prevent? - [John B.] Well, there was some historical evils, and the English Bill of Rights went into place in 1689, and when that went into place there was actually a controversy in England around a person by the name of Titus Oates. Titus Oates was somebody who had false accusation, what was had committed perjury resulted, actually, that allegation in the execution of 15 Catholics."
Social Studies,"And the plot that he'd alleged was one to assassinate the king of England. - [John S.] The question is what to do with Oates, right? Because as a sort of a moral matter, he's about as bad as it gets. In fact, in 2005, English historians voted him the worst Briton of the 17th century (Kim laughs) and the third worst Briton of the last 1,000 years, or something like that. So a very bad guy, you could think of him as a sort of a serial killer."
Social Studies,"But the problem is that the actual crime he committed was the crime of perjury. And even though his perjury resulted in the deaths of many innocent people, nonetheless he could only be convicted of perjury, which at the time was a misdemeanor. Which meant that he could not be executed for his crime."
Social Studies,"So when it came time for his sentencing, the judge, Chief Justice Jeffreys, who is a famous hanging judge from English history, says to Oates, ""Well, Oates, we can't take your life, ""we can't take your limb, ""but we have something special prepared for you."" And it turns out that what they had prepared for him was, number one, a huge fine, they fined him like 2,000 marks."
Social Studies,"They sentenced that he'd be dragged across the city of London while being flogged, he was dragged from Aldgate to Newgate while being flogged, and then two days later, just as the scabs were starting to form on his wounds, he's dragged back across the city of London from Newgate to Tyburn, again while being flogged. Many people think the hope was that he would die from the flogging, but, like a cockroach in a nuclear war, he survived."
Social Studies,"- [John B.] This punishment was actually a very severe punishment, and after the English Bill of Rights, it was promulgated. The Titus Oates' punishment was challenged and some of the members of the House of Lords actually called the punishment barbarous, inhumane, and unchristian, and contrary to the English Bill of Rights. And so, there was no precedence to warrant the punishments of whipping and committing to prison for life for the crime of perjury."
Social Studies,"This punishment was eventually remitted, in the sense that Oates was later released. - [John S.] Although, the House of Lords refused to vote to suspend the judgment against Oates 'cause they hated him so much they said, ""So ill a man shouldn't get the benefit of any relief."" But they all agreed that the punishment was cruel and unusual, and what's interesting is in the debate they say things like, ""This punishment is contrary to law and ancient practice."
Social Studies,"""It is without precedent, ""and it'll be a bad precedent for the future."" So, in other words, it's cruel and the way we know it's cruel is because it's so much harsher than has previously been inflicted for the crime of perjury, right? So the Oates case shows us that when the words cruel and unusual were first used, they were used to describe punishments that are harsher than the Common law would permit, or harsher than long-standing prior practice would permit."
Social Studies,"And this means that, among other things, the cruel and unusual punishments clause is not limited to gruesome punishments like torture and the rack and all that kind of thing. Because, in fact, the punishments inflicted on Oates, although they were very harsh for the crime of perjury, were not as harsh as some other punishments that the Common law permitted for other crimes like treason. - [Kim] Wow! So that tells us a lot about the English context of cruel and unusual punishment."
Social Studies,"Do we know what cruel and unusual meant to the framers of the U.S. Bill of Rights? - [John S.] So, punishments were cruel and unusual, again if they're too harsh in light of long-standing prior practice for the crime for which they're inflicted. There's another problem with statutory law, or with decisions of a judge or a king or a president for that matter, that's also really relevant when we think about the 8th Amendment. And that is, sometimes the government gets really mad at someone."
Social Studies,"They either think of a person as an enemy of the state and they wanna inflict the worst punishment they can on that person, or perhaps there's a panic about a certain group in society. So, for example, in American society recently, there have been panics about drug crime, or panics about sex offenses, and every time that happens, the government tries to respond with new forms of punishment that are much, much harsher than what came before."
Social Studies,"And so, the insight behind the 8th Amendment is that when the government wants to inflict a new punishment, you have to compare it against long-standing prior practice, that is you have to compare it against the Common law, right? So the Common law was called the law of custom and long usage, right? So, if something comported with the Common law, it was usual. If it was contrary to the Common law, it was unusual, and that's where we get the phrase cruel and unusual punishments."
Social Studies,"It's basically punishments that are cruel in light of or in comparison to long-standing prior practice. So the basic point of the 8th Amendment from a historical point of view is to prohibit the government from innovating in a cruel manner, making up new cruel punishments in response to some actual or perceived provocation by a criminal. - [John B.] When the U.S. Bill of Rights was adopted, many years later, many decades later, they had their own issues that they were struggling with."
Social Studies,"And so, the history shows that the American founders probably meant something different than the English meant because it was done over 100 years later, but no one knows exactly what was meant when they adopted that wording. To give you an example, when the bill was debated in Congress, a delegate from South Carolina, a representative from South Carolina said that he objected to the words nor cruel and unusual punishments because he said the import of them was too indefinite."
Social Studies,"And there was another legislator, Mr. Livermore from New Hampshire, who said that, ""The clause seems to express a great deal of humanity ""in which account I have no objection to it, ""but as it seems to have no meaning in it, ""I do not think it necessary. What is meant by the terms excessive bail?"", he asked. ""Who are to be the judges?"", he also asked."
Social Studies,"""What is understood by excessive fines? It lies with the Court to determine."" And so, that's really where we are today in a lot of ways, the Court is still deciding, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court, is still deciding what the 8th Amendment line what it actually means today. - [John S.] The modern case law, especially starting in the 1970s, revolved a lot around the death penalty."
Social Studies,"And so, the question was, is it still okay to execute people for various crimes short of murder? Since the 70s, the Court has continued to do that in a number of areas so it's said you can't execute the mentally disabled anymore, you can't execute minors, you can't execute anyone for a non-homicide offense."
Social Studies,"Although it's limited the death penalty in the name of current standards of decency, it's really not clear how the Court has set about to determine whether a punishment meets current standards of decency. When the Court is kind of on its own saying that a punishment violates current standards of decency, despite the fact that most democratically elected legislators actually approved the practice that it looks like the Court's acting as sort of a political body."
Social Studies,"It sort of led the Court to ignore what I think is the real danger of cruelty, which is that when there's a public panic and the legislature responds by ratcheting a punishment to new and unprecedented levels of punishment. And that's actually happened quite a lot in the last 40 years. And every time there's a panic, you'll predicatively see the legislators coming up with new punishments that are much, much harsher than what came before."
Social Studies,"And so, for example, with registered sex offenders, there are now a bunch of states that actually impose chemical castration as a form of punishment for sex offenders. Now, castration as a form of punishment fell out of usage in the 13th century. We're literally getting medieval on sex offenders, but the Court can't do anything really to stop it or at least hasn't because these are very popular forms of punishment, everyone hates sex offenders."
Social Studies,"- [John B.] The UN has actually decided that anything more than 15 days use of solitary confinement should not be permitted. Justice Anthony Kennedy actually raised the issue of solitary confinement in recent opinion. He authored for the Supreme Court, he actually raised the issue on his own, had a whole argument at one point talking about how long people actually spent in solitary confinement in American prisons, including on death row."
Social Studies,"And you have cases actually where people are spending not just years, but sometimes decades on death row in these kinds of conditions. Justice Breyer just wrote a dissent in a case where the person had been on death row for more than 40 years, so literally four decades in these kinds of very harsh conditions of confinement."
Social Studies,"Other countries have decided that is not something that they want to permit and they've actually set out a rule that anybody that's on death row for a certain number of years, for example, would have their sentence commuted to a life sentence because of the psychological aspect of sorta waiting for one's own death. - [Kim] In the Bill of Rights, this is the last of four amendments actually, that are concerned with protections for the accused."
Social Studies,"So, why do you think there's so much in the Bill of Rights about the justice system? Were the framers particularly interested in making sure that the accused had rights? - [John S.] Yeah, they were."
Social Studies,"And, in particular, Americans were very devoted to the idea of the Common law as a source of rights, right? In fact, that's why we had the American Revolution in the first place, was that England was denying to Americans Common law rights, like the right not to be taxed without representation in parliament, but also more specifically to the criminal law, they were denying them the right to a jury trial in criminal cases. And so, Americans wanted to make sure that when the U.S."
Social Studies,"Constitution was adopted, that those Common law rights that had built up over time in England would be preserved in the new American constitutional order. And many of those rights had to do with criminal law, both criminal procedures and, to some degree, subset of criminal law and, of course, criminal punishments. And again, the reason gets back to sort of what I said at the beginning, which is that when the government punishes someone, that's about the worst thing it can do."
Social Studies,"And because the early Americans who framed the Constitution were very powerfully concerned with liberty, they wanted to make sure the government would preserve their liberty, protect their liberty, and not become tyrannical, right? And so, one of the main ways that they wanted to make sure this happened was by limiting the power of the government to punish whoever it wanted to for any reason that it wanted to."
Social Studies,"And so, we have a, really the majority of the protections in the Bill of Rights have to do with the protections for criminal defendants. - [Kim] What about excessive bail and excessive fines? How can we define what kind of, financial penalty, is proportionate to a crime? - [John B.] The courts have said, essentially, they've looked at dictionary definitions that excessive means more than is necessary. One of the core principles actually go back to look at Beccaria's work in the 1760s."
Social Studies,"He talked about this idea of a scale of crimes and a scale of punishments, and he said that there should be proportionality between the two. And so, that proportionality principle is one that we're really still wrestling with today."
Social Studies,"- [John S.] Now, the point of bail is not to punish someone, but rather just to make sure that they will appear at trial, right? And so, the amount of money you have to impose for bail doesn't depend so much on what crime you committed, but what your financial resources are, right? It depends partially on the crime too, but largely on your financial resources."
Social Studies,"So the amount of money necessary to make sure that a poor man appears at trial is probably gonna be much lower than the amount of money necessary to make sure that a rich man appears at trial. And so, it's a standard that depends partly on the nature of the crime, but also partially on the nature of the offender. - [Kim] I imagine that what seems like cruel and unusual punishment in the 18th century might not be what we consider cruel and unusual today."
Social Studies,"For example, we don't do whipping as a punishment anymore. How has what counts as cruel and unusual punishment changed over time? - [John B.] The law really changes gradually over time, as you know. And so, when you look back at history they actually had a large collection of pretty gruesome punishments back in the 18th century."
Social Studies,"And we had non-lethal corporal punishments, they used things like branding people, they, of course, were whipping slaves back then, slavery was still around, this was well before the Civil War ended, the institution of slavery. And we also had things like ear cropping, people would get their ears cut off."
Social Studies,"In the Crimes Act of 1790, which was passed just the year before the ratification of the 8th Amendment, the Congress actually authorized public whipping, lashing of people, and also authorized the pillory, the same punishment that had been used against Titus Oates. So, there was these non-lethal corporal punishments, and really the death penalty is sort of the last vestige of bodily punishment that the 8th Amendment, the Supreme Court has read the 8th Amendment to allow the use of capital punishment."
Social Studies,"That issue is still a very live one before the Supreme Court. We're now seeing challenges about lethal injection, protocols. We saw a challenge to a protocol in Kentucky in 2008. We saw one to a protocol in Oklahoma in 2015. These, of course, are things that the founding fathers would never have envisioned . - [John S.] Lethal injection typically involves a three-drug cocktail. So there's a barbiturate, which is supposed to put you to sleep."
Social Studies,"There's a paralyzing agent, which paralyzes your body and also stops your lungs from moving. And there's a heart-stopping agent. Give the offender all three and they're supposed to die quickly and painlessly. But the problem is if the sedative doesn't put you completely, deeply unconscious, then the other two drugs are likely to make you suffer quite a bit before you die."
Social Studies,"And so, the question is this cruel and unusual, or is it not cruel and unusual? And to date, the Supreme Court has twice held that lethal injection is not cruel and unusual, and their main reason has been that the state's not trying to torture you to death. And so, if maybe, or sometimes accidentally, tortured to death, well, that's just too bad, but it's not a cruel and unusual punishment. - [John B.] So, the Supreme Court has approved various methods of execution."
Social Studies,"At the same time, however, the 8th Amendment has been read to protect prisoners. So, in general, the 8th Amendment is sort of a protective shield that prohibits prison guards from gratuitously beating up inmates. It requires prisons to provide some level of healthcare to prisoners because they cannot get it themselves, they're sort of wards of the state once they're put in prison. It requires inmates be fed and sheltered."
Social Studies,"So, in a lot of ways, the 8th Amendment is a protective shield protecting inmates, but then in the use of the capital punishment it becomes what I like to call kind of a, it's kind of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde kind of jurisprudence that the 8th Amendment has right now. - [Kim] So we've learned that the 8th Amendment seeks to limit the power of the government in meting out punishment to people who have been accused or convicted of a crime."
Social Studies,"Although it's hard to tell exactly what constitutes excessive fines or bail, in general, it's accepted that those punishments should be proportional to the crimes in question. Today, one of the biggest debates concerns whether, or how, the 8th Amendment may limit the death penalty. To learn more about the 8th Amendment, visit the National Constituiton Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,And especially the first eight of these are all about protecting individuals rights. So you have those rights. But then there's a question. To what degree are these rights protected against state laws? This became a little bit clearer once the 14th Amendment came along and just to remind ourselves here's section one of the 14th Amendment.
Social Studies,"We really want to zero is on the due process clause, which says, ""nor shall any state deprive any person ""of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" Now, some have argued for total incorporation that says the 14th Amendment's making it clear that the state cannot infringe on these rights."
Social Studies,"But what has happened, especially in the United States Supreme Court, is that on various decisions, maybe this was something involving the 5th Amendment, they've ruled that the rights described by that amendment can't be limited by a state law. So they would have selectively incorporated the 5th Amendment from the Bill of Rights and decision on what the state can and cannot do, and their justification there's a due process clause of the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"And to make that a little bit more tangible we can look at some relatively recent cases. In 2008 you have the case District of Columbia versus Heller. This is a really interesting case around the 2nd Amendment. The District of Columbia, Washington, D.C., had a law that banned hand guns. So one of the residents challenges that hand gun ban and it goes all the way to the United States Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"And in the decision on District of Columbia versus Heller the United States Supreme Court says that the District of Columbia cannot pass a law that violates Heller's 2nd Amendment right because of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. But that still left a little bit of an opening. You fast forward and in 2010 you have another similar case go to the Supreme Court. This is McDonald versus Chicago. Chicago had a similar hand gun ban, and McDonald was a resident of Chicago."
Social Studies,"The government in Chicago argued that okay, the District of Columbia versus Heller does not apply to us because that was a federal district and it would not apply to something that is part of a state. Well, the Supreme Court disagreed with Chicago and took the side of McDonald. They selectively incorporated using the 14th Amendment as their justification. They said look, the state cannot deprive any person of their liberties."
Social Studies,"So they selectively incorporated the 2nd Amendment into that decision and made it very clear that a state cannot pass a law that infringes on people's 2nd Amendment rights. So big picture, selective incorporation, it's the doctrine where judicial decisions incorporate rights from the Bill of Rights to limit laws from states that are perceived to infringe on those rights, and the justification comes from the 14th Amendment.."
Social Studies,"Elizabeth Wydra is a Supreme Court litigator and the president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. So, Miss Wydra, could you set the stage for us? Who were the challengers in this case and why did they decide to sue? - [Elizabeth] The lead plaintiff is or was Otis McDonald, then 76 year old African American retired maintenance engineer who lived in a part of Chicago and wanted to have a gun for self defense, a handgun, to protect himself and his family in his home."
Social Studies,He lived in a neighborhood that had grown increasingly troubled with gang and drug related violence and he felt that he wanted to have a handgun to protect his wife and his family after his home had been broken into several times.
Social Studies,"But because the city of Chicago had strict rules barring handguns, he and three other Chicago residents brought their case into court asking the court to find that the individual right to keep and bear arms, including a handgun for self defense in the home that had been recognized just a few years earlier by the Supreme Court with respect to the federal government, also applies to the states and cities like Chicago."
Social Studies,"- [Alan] In 2008, the Supreme Court had held that the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution guarantees Americans the right to have guns for the purpose of self defense, but that case took place in Washington D.C., and Washington D.C. is sort of a unique creature in our law."
Social Studies,"It's a federal city, it's not located in any particular state, and so everything that the city of Washington does is essentially done by the federal government or a unit of the federal government to which the Bill of Rights applies directly, but historically, the Bill of Rights was never thought to apply directly to limit what cities and states could do."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So what were some of competing interpretations that were at issue in this case? - [Alan] Well, there were a number of interpretations that were at issue. The 14th Amendment has several parts to it."
Social Studies,"In the first section of the 14th Amendment, it states that, ""no state shall make or enforce ""any law which shall abridge the privileges ""or immunities of citizens of the United States."" And then it also says, among other things, that ""states can't deprive people of due process ""when it comes time to regulating their life, liberty, ""or property."" States may not deprive anyone of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."
Social Studies,"When it comes to your basic civil rights, the question had always been whether or not the states are bound not to violate your civil rights because they are told not to abridge the privileges or immunities of American citizens or are your rights not to be violated because the states can't deprive you of due process of law."
Social Studies,"- [Elizabeth] So when the drafters of the 14th Amendment were coming together to think about what rights would be protected in the 14th Amendment, they looked at a lot of the abuses by state governments of key rights that had been previously protected against federal government action in the Bill of Rights. And when they were debating what rights would be included in these protections against state action, they talked repeatedly about the importance of the right to keep and bear arms."
Social Studies,"But the way they talked about it was very different from the way that we think about the 18th century revolutionary founders talking about the right to keep and bear arms. In that case, it was very much about the militia and preventing the tyranny of government action. In the 14th Amendment context, the right to keep and bear arms was very much an individual right."
Social Studies,"They were concerned about freed persons being subject to white militia violence and being able to protect themselves with a gun in their house, and so that was really one of the ways in which they wanted to protect the individual right to keep and bear arms, different from the way that I think the founders thought about it when they were drafting the 2nd Amendment."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Yeah, this is a really interesting point because you can kind of see how these things evolve over time and particularly in the 1860s after the Civil War, there are many local or state statutes known as the Black Codes that specifically prevented newly free African Americans from owning firearms or any kind of weapon."
Social Studies,"- [Elizabeth] Exactly, and that was a concern because, one, it was a right that they considered to be a right of citizenship, but two, and more practically and more immediately of concern for the people who were being targeted by this racial violence, it was something that was a question of life or death for them, and the debates on this by the drafters of the 14th Amendment were very clear and very colorful."
Social Studies,"Senator Samuel Pomeroy described how indispensable the right to keep and bear arms was and how important it was that the 14th Amendment protect that right. He said during the debates, ""every man should have ""the right to bear arms for the defense of himself, ""and family, and his homestead."
Social Studies,"""And if the cabin door of the freedman is broken open, ""and the intruder enters for purposes as vile ""as were known to slavery, then should a well-loaded musket ""be in the hand of the occupant, to send the polluted wretch ""to another world, where his wretchedness ""will forever remain complete."" - [Kim] So going back to the McDonald case, how did the court rule in this case? - [Alan] In McDonald, we made two arguments for why we should win."
Social Studies,"The first argument we made was the historically more obvious one, although it's one that the courts had not often entertained, and that's the argument that says that when the 14th Amendment provided that the people cannot be deprived of the privileges or immunities of American citizenship. That means they couldn't be deprived of their basic fundamental rights. Right there in the text of the 14th Amendment it tells you that you can't be deprived of the rights of American citizenship."
Social Studies,"Secondly, we made the argument that, and this is the argument that the courts have been more open to over the years, we made the argument that where the state is prohibited from depriving Otis McDonald and other Chicago residents of due process of law, and you can't deprive someone of due process."
Social Studies,"That means not just that the state can do things arbitrarily, not just that Otis McDonald is entitled to some procedural protections in the way that he's regulated, but also that there's some results, some things that simply cannot be done, and taking away someone's firearms in violation of the 2nd Amendment rights is not something that the state can do. There's no procedure that the state could create to achieve that. They would still be considered to be giving somebody due process of law."
Social Studies,"- [Elizabeth] So the court said what we have done when we've looked at individual rights under the 14th Amendment, and whether or not original Bill of Rights rights that were initially understood to limit the federal government applied to the states, is look at whether or not they are part of what we generally talk about as fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, or stated another way, the question is whether the right is firmly rooted in this nation's history and tradition, and when they looked at that question with respect to the right to keep and bear arms, they looked at a lot of the Reconstruction history and said this was clearly something that the drafters of the 14th Amendment considered to be very fundamental to ordered liberty and thought that, indeed, the freedmen, the African American people of the South who had been subject to the slave power and people across the country who'd been subject to discrimination from the states should be able to look to the Constitution to protect the right to keep and bear arms as their individual right, just as the court had held in the Heller case, they could be able to look to the Constitution for protection of that right against the federal government."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So in the McDonald case, how did the majority of the court rule? - [Alan] The justices broke down in multiple different ways. There were four justices, led by Justice Alito, who refused to look any further at the privileges or immunities clause. They thought it was old, it was water under the bridge."
Social Studies,"They were not interested in looking to see whether or not the courts erasing of that provision was legitimate, even it's widely agreed to be illegitimate today, but the court didn't wanna go there, and instead those four justices, led by Justice Alito, held that the due process clause incorporates the 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms as against the states because it is a fundamental right. It's deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions."
Social Studies,"It's something that's very basic to our understanding of our civil and political institutions. The four justices thought the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental. - [Elizabeth] There was actually a debate among the members of the majority who all believe that there was a right to have a handgun in the house for self defense that was protected against state and local government regulations, but Justice Thomas would have found that right through another means."
Social Studies,"He would have looked at the privileges or immunities clause of the 14th Amendment, instead of the now accepted method of looking at due process liberty clause of the 14th Amendment, which is how these other provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated against the states."
Social Studies,"There were many arguments, including, I should say, a brief that I filed on behalf of scholars from across the ideological spectrum who said that, in fact, the privileges or immunities clause of the 14th Amendment is the part of that constitutional amendment that was intended to protect this particular substantive right as well as the other substantive rights of the Bill of Rights against state infringement, just as Thomas' concurrence did not get any of the other votes, whether from the people who were against the right to keep and bear arms or those who didn't, but it is an important contribution to thinking about how we understand rights and where they are protected in the Constitution."
Social Studies,"- [Alan] Justice Thomas' opinion in McDonald is groundbreaking. It represents the first time since 1868 that the original meaning of the 14th Amendment's privileges or immunities clause, the basic protection that we have for civil rights in this country against state and local governments was decisive in a case at the Supreme Court. It's been that long since a true original understanding of the 14th Amendment's language has finally proven to be decisive."
Social Studies,"- [Elizabeth] There were, of course, justices who thought that there is not an individual right to have a handgun in the home for self defense. These were the same justices, not surprisingly, who thought there wasn't a 2nd Amendment right to be protected against federal government action to keep a handgun in the home for self defense."
Social Studies,"They would've thought that this was much more a right in the 2nd Amendment context that had to do with militia service, military service, and therefore did not extend to an individual right to have a gun in the home for self defense. - [Alan] McDonald's really a 14th Amendment case. I mean, guns happen to be the thing that was in it, but I'd always seen as primarily is a 14th Amendment case. It's not really a case that tells you anything about the scope of the 2nd Amendment."
Social Studies,"In fact, it doesn't say anything about the scope of the 2nd Amendment, very little. - [Elizabeth] There are many issues left to be resolved in the 2nd Amendment context. The Heller case itself, which first articulated that there was a right for individuals to keep and bear arms in their homes for self defense made clear that it wasn't saying that there could be no gun regulation."
Social Studies,"That case, even though it was written by Justice Scolia, and certainly in the McDonald case, Justice Alito's majority opinion reiterated this, said that while there were certain laws that would be struck down as unconstitutional because they prohibited the possession of handguns in the home, they recognized at the same time that the right to keep and bear arms is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever, and for whatever purpose, so given that the court itself, and even very conservative justices recognize that there could be and perhaps should be common sense limitations on both the types of guns that are allowed, the manner in which they are allowed, and where they can be taken and in what manner, then a lot of the gun regulations that are being passed are still very much a part of the constitutional debate."
Social Studies,"We've seen, frankly, most of the laws, thus far, be upheld as constitutional laws, that, for example, target assault weapons, high capacity magazines, and certain licensing and registration requirements. So I think we will see more cases to define the contours of the individual right to keep and bear arms as these gun regulations get passed and as the courts get to pass upon their constitutionality."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that the Supreme Court ruled that the 14th Amendment's due process clause that no state can deprive a citizen of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, did incorporate the 2nd Amendment into the states under the reasoning that the right to keep and bear arms for self defense is fundamental to the nation's scheme of ordered liberty."
Social Studies,"According to Alan Gura, even though this case was about guns, it was really a 14th Amendment case concerning whether states can restrict citizens' liberty. Elizabeth Wydra, however, cautions that the decision in McDonald didn't preclude any restriction on gun ownership and she suspects that new cases will continue to define the individual right to keep and bear arms."
Social Studies,"To learn more about this case, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Kahn Academy's resources on US Government and Politics.."
Social Studies,"Donald Dripps is the Warren Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of San Diego School of Law. And Steven Saltzburg is the Wallace and Beverly Woodbury University Professor of Law at George Washington Law School. So, Professor Saltzburg could you talk a little bit about why the framers were interested in choosing to protect these rights in particular? - [Saltzburg] The fifth amendment really addresses four different things."
Social Studies,"One, it says that generally you can't be charged with a serious crime unless you're indicted by a grand jury. Two, it says you can't be subjected to double jeopardy. Three, it says you can't be compelled to be a witness against yourself. And four, there is this due process right, not to be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process."
Social Studies,"If you look at it, the three provisions, the grand jury provision, double jeopardy, and the privilege against self-incrimination all have a common history and that is that in England there was a time in which the crown, the King, basically tried to assert power to bringing people to trial for charges that the King wanted brought. And the grand jury served as a protection between the King and ordinary people."
Social Studies,"- [Dripps] Most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights are aimed at preventing the recurrence of some specific abuse that had been known to English history. There are different provisions in the fifth amendment that speak to different abuses. The fundamental one and the one that goes furthest back in the legal history, back to Magna Carta and so on is the due process clause."
Social Studies,"And that clause means that no person can be injured by the government except according to the law of the land and after a fair trial. And that in the very, very distant past back in the 13th century King John had an infamous practice of executing supposed rebellious barons and then holding a solemn trial after the drawing and quartering. And so, that notion of judgment before punishment is really, really fundamental. That's what due process is about at its most basic level."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, so can you say more about the due process clause here? What is due process? - [Saltzburg] Due process is an extraordinarily complicated concept. It means that there are certain procedural and substantive rules that must be honored in the way in which governments approach individuals and entities that they are seeking to regulate. It's not a simple bright line that in order to have due process this is what is required. Due process is somewhat flexible."
Social Studies,"It tends to provide more protections when individuals are faced with more serious consequences. So, in terms of criminal law it's generally understood that the most severe penalties that we have that can legally be imposed upon people are the death penalty, prison, and jail. And generally, you can't impose any of those except as punishment for a crime. And so, the due process in the criminal arena is largely defined by the Bill of Rights."
Social Studies,"And some common law understandings that have been carried forward, let me give you a couple of examples. There is nothing in the Constitution that says the government must prove guilt in a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt, but that is a fundamental part of American law. The Supreme Court has held that that is a part of what due process requires and that is the law throughout the United States not withstanding the fact you don't see it in the Constitution."
Social Studies,"Similarly, the right to a unanimous jury in a criminal case is also not found anywhere in the Constitution. - [Kim] You mentioned a grand jury, so how is that different from an ordinary jury? - [Dripps] The grand jury served a very delicate role in Founding era times because many, many prosecutions were brought by private persons."
Social Studies,There were no police forces of the modern paramilitary 24/7 type and a lot of law enforcement was done by self help and prosecutions were privately funded and sometimes lay people would represent themselves pro se in pressing a criminal prosection. And the grand jury was there to make sure that people weren't subjected to vindictive or malicious prosecutions by ill-spirited neighbors and that sort of thing.
Social Studies,"The framers probably had in mind a famous case of the Earl of Shaftesbury who was suspected of misdeeds and a grand jury famously refused to indict him. And so, they sought as one among many checks against the possible abuse of power by this new federal government. - [Saltzburg] So, a grand jury is a body that decides whether or not to bring a charge against an individual or an entity like a corporation."
Social Studies,"The grand jury in federal court happens to be 23 people, but there isn't anything in the constitution that actually says it has to be that number. Unlike a trial by jury which we call a petty jury, the grand jury does not have to be unanimous. It basically decides to bring a charge by majority vote and the grand jury specifically instructed that its job is not to decide guilt or innocence, its job is to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to bring a job."
Social Studies,"Which we usually say means probable cause to believe that a crime was committed and a particular person committed that crime. So the grand jury's function is to bring a charge, the trial jury's function is to then decide guilt or innocence. - [Kim] Interesting, so how about double jeopardy? This is something that I think we have a maybe rudimentary understanding of in popular culture."
Social Studies,"What does double jeopardy really mean? - [Saltzburg] If we didn't have a double jeopardy clause the executive branch, if it could persuade grand jury to charge somebody with a crime, could prosecute that person and if the person was acquitted then government could do it again. Bring the same change and do it again until they got a conviction and that meant that an individual could be persecuted rather than prosecuted by continuing charges for the exact same thing."
Social Studies,"And the basic function of the double jeopardy clause is to basically tell the government, you get one shot. - [Dripps] Trials are very stressful and very expensive, and the government has more resources than the typical defendant does and so one concern is that you would just have the government have power to bankrupt people by retrying the case over and over again. It becomes very, very complicated saying just what the same offense is."
Social Studies,"The current doctrine is that every statutory crime that includes different factual elements than every other statutory crime arising out of the same course of conduct is a separate crime. - [Kim] Are there an exceptions to double jeopardy, or common misconceptions about how it works? - [Saltzburg] Yes, there are two common misconceptions."
Social Studies,"One of them is that you can only be tried once for the same criminal activity and the reason you can actually be prosecuted more than once is because in our system, federal government in each state is considered to be a separate sovereign which means the federal government can charge someone with a crime, let's say a drug conspiracy. The State of Virginia or California can also prosecute for the same criminal conduct. The states have their own criminal law to enforce."
Social Studies,"So technically, someone could be prosecuted let's say by the Commonwealth of Virginia for a drug conspiracy and convicted. And then could be prosecuted again by the federal government or another state for the same criminal activity and be convicted or acquitted and the double jeopardy clause would not be violated. The second thing about double jeopardy is that it only protects you from being prosecuted a second time by the same sovereign for the same crime."
Social Studies,"It doesn't protect you from being prosecuted for a different crime. Suppose the State of California prosecutes a defendant for murder and the defendant is acquitted, the State of California could then bring a second prosecution for a kidnapping of the same victim that actually occurred before the murder. And because that's a different crime, the double jeopardy clause doesn't bar a separate prosecution."
Social Studies,- [Kim] And so there's also a clause here that says an individual shall not be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
Social Studies,"So, this is what we call taking the fifth, right? What does that mean? - [Dripps] So, the fifth amendment privilege is a privilege that can be asserted by anyone who is called to answer by agents of the government and to claim the privilege it has to be the case that the witness is being compelled to speak will suffer adverse consequences if she doesn't answer the questions the government officers want her to answer."
Social Studies,"Those answers have to tend to incriminate the witness and those answers have to be testimonial, that is to say they have to say in some way they constitute witnessing. - [Saltzburg] Good lawyers, good lawyers will generally advise their clients to take the fifth. That is, claim their privilege against self-incrimination almost any time that the government is seriously investigating them."
Social Studies,"And the reason is people's memories are often bad, that when people are asked question they may believe that something happened in a certain way but they haven't gone back to review it. And when people make mistakes, simple mistakes, that are made in response to a question may look like people deliberately lied. They may make someone look like they were attempting to deceive investigators."
Social Studies,"And therefore, when in doubt, individuals who are being investigated have good reason to invoke their privilege against self-incrimination. - [Dripps] Historically, there were two things that the fifth amendment privilege was really supposed to prevent. One was that while the English system relied on grand juries and petty juries and cross examination, confrontational trials, the European system of the Founding era even as late as the end of the 18th century still relied on juridical torture."
Social Studies,"So, if there was a lot of preliminary proof, if it's super probable cause against a suspect in say France or Germany, the judges will authorize to torture the target into confessing. They didn't want to adopt this inquisitorial practices of continental Europe."
Social Studies,"And the other great abuse behind the privilege was the Court of Star Chamber's use of the oath ex officio which was witnesses were called before the Star Chamber without knowing what the investigation was about, whether they were a target, what they were suspected of doing, and the first thing that happened was they were obliged to swear an oath."
Social Studies,"And there was a famous case involving a man named John Lilburne who refused to take the oath and was torturously punished by the Court of Star Chamber for refusing to take that oath they pilloried him and they flogged him, and his case was seen as kind of an example of the kinds of abuses that might be done by asking questions subject to oaths where the answer might incriminate you or expose your to perjury, or expose your soul to eternal consequences."
Social Studies,"So, those two things were behind the privilege against self-incrimination. The Founders didn't want either of those to come back from the past to haunt the new continent. - [Kim] Say that I have committed a crime, what might happen? Are police or investigators required to tell me about my right not to self-incriminate? - [Saltzburg] Starting 1966, in the case that many people have now heard of Miranda versus Arizona."
Social Studies,"The United States Supreme Court held that when a person is in custody, that is generally has been arrested and the investigators or prosecutors want to question the suspect they have to give a series of warnings which are widely known as the Miranda Warnings. In short, they have to say to the suspect, ""You have the right to remain silent. ""Anything you say can and will be used ""against you in a court of law."
Social Studies,"""You have the right to have a lawyer present ""during any questioning, and if you cannot afford a lawyer, ""one will be appointed for you."" - [Dripps] When the suspect is in custody, they have to give the famous Miranda Warning that everybody knows from movies and television and so forth, and that's the one case where the government is required to be proactive."
Social Studies,"In front of a congressional committee or grand jury investigation, or if you're just a witness at a civil trial, and there's a question that might expose you to criminal liability you have to claim the privilege. You have to say, ""I refuse to answer that question ""on the grounds that it may incriminate me."" When the suspect is under arrest and the police wanna question him, they have a different duty."
Social Studies,"They have a duty to proactively give him a warning to make sure that he understands his rights, that he doesn't have to say anything to the police, that what he does say could be admissible against him. - [Kim] So, we've learned that the fifth amendment protects citizens from possible abuses of power by the government when an individual is charged with a crime. It requires a grand jury to determine whether an individual should be indicted for a crime."
Social Studies,Limits the number of times an individual can be tried for the same crime. Protects people from self-incrimination and requires that the government follow fair procedures in prosecuting the law. To learn more about the fifth amendment visit the National Constitution Center's interactive constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics..
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Sixth Amendment, I sought out the help of two experts. Stephanos Bibas is a United States Circuit Judge for the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He's also a leading scholar of criminal procedure. Jeffrey Fisher is Professor of Law and Co-Director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at Stanford Law School."
Social Studies,"So Judge Bibas, in the case of the Bill of Rights, the Framers were trying to prevent particular abuses of the government, so what was the historical background that led them to want to protect these rights in particular? - [Stephanos] In England in the late 17th and early 18th century, there was a series of treason trials, other political trials, and the king had done some things that bypassed the usual mode of trial in criminal cases. The Anglo-American system is known as the Common Law."
Social Studies,"It involves live testimony in open court before a jury of your peers, and the jury ultimately decides did you do it, were you blameworthy, do you deserve the punishment? The Crown had railroaded some of its political opponents."
Social Studies,"People like Sir Walter Raleigh, people accused in the Popish Plots during the strife between Catholics and Protestants and some of these convictions were later understood to have been wrongful ones and so the colonists in England and then in America insisted on protecting against various ways of diminishing or abridging the trial that would be speedy, that would be public, that would be before a jury, that would have an evenly matched prosecution and defense and would have an opportunity to look the witness in the eye and confront him the way it was always done in England as opposed to on continental Europe."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] There's a varied history, primarily in England of certain periods of time where people were prosecuted in ways that the Founders deemed fundamentally unfair. Probably the most notorious example was the Star Chamber."
Social Studies,That was a moniker given to a king-run tribunal decades before the Founding where people were picked up and arrested and then sentenced to criminal punishment and sometimes to death without ever having an opportunity to challenge the charges against them and sometimes not even knowing what the charges were against them. That kind of a travesty of justice and abuse of power was probably the foremost thing in the Framers' minds. - [Stephanos] This was partly for the benefit of the defendant or the accused.
Social Studies,"It also was very importantly about protecting the citizens' right to control criminal justice. That it wasn't the king who would do this, and the king couldn't just let his royal officers off. It's very important to look at the Declaration of Independence. A bunch of the complaints in the Declaration are complaints that the king is bypassing these usual modes, that he's protecting his soldiers by a mock trial from punishment for murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of the States."
Social Studies,That he's depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury and that he has made the judges subject to his manipulation and pleasure because they don't have stable salaries. The colonists were very suspicious of the king's manipulation of criminal justice.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So how does the Sixth Amendment inform how the US legal system works today? - [Jeffrey] The first important thing to understand is that when the Sixth Amendment was drafted, just like all the other first ten amendments, they applied primarily only to the federal government not to state governments, but in the sixties and seventies the Supreme Court applied all of these rights one-by-one to the states."
Social Studies,Now because the rights apply to both the federal government and to state governments the Sixth Amendment applies every single time somebody is charged with a crime.
Social Studies,"That starts with knowing what you're being charged with, whether it's by what's known as a grand jury indictment or some other method of accusing somebody of committing a crime, and it continues on with the right to an attorney to represent the accused and goes all the way through the decision-making process with how the jury decides whether to convict or not - [Kim] This is fascinating, but there are a couple things that I see in the Sixth Amendment that seem like they might be a little difficult to define, particularly the idea of a speedy trial."
Social Studies,"What actually counts as speedy? - [Stephanos] The speedy trial component is not well-defined. The Supreme Court has ultimately said, ""Well, we're gonna balance a bunch of factors. How long is the delay? What's the reason for the delay? Has the defendant shown any prejudice from the delay? How long did it take after the defendant requested the speedy trial?"" Very rarely does the court actually throw out a case based on that."
Social Studies,"What happens more often is that the defendant makes a request and then judges really try to push the case along to be faster. The court has turned it into really focusing on the defendant's interest in something fast, and that matters a lot when a defendant doesn't make bail and is being held in jail pending trial. Those cases will go to trial in a matter of months. A case where someone is out on bail can easily take a year or two before it ultimately proceeds to trial."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] What's speedy or what's reasonable in 1791 might not be speedy or reasonable in 2017. What the courts have said with respect to speedy is there's not a bright line rule, say, one year, five years, whatever it might be that somebody has to be brought to trial after being charged."
Social Studies,"Rather, what the court does is it considers how diligently the prosecution has tried to pursue the case in light of other factors such as the complexity of the case, whether the defendant himself wants the case to go to trial soon or whether the defendant himself has agreed to certain delays or said that he doesn't mind them, and whether there's prejudice that has occurred which is a legal way of saying whether somebody's been harmed or injured by the delay."
Social Studies,"Say for example a key witness has now died or fled the jurisdiction. Flexible words like speedy in essence translate some measure of discretion and flexibility to the courts. - [Kim] Why is our legal process so much slower than it was in the 18th century? - [Stephanos] That connects up to the second set of rights we've constructed around what makes something a public trial. One of the main things there is the jury right. Juries in the 18th century, we didn't have a jury selection process."
Social Studies,"The first 12 people who didn't know the plaintiff or the defendant or the victim or whoever it was would be empaneled and they would serve all day and they'd hear all the cases that came that day. You didn't have lawyers involved in most of these cases. Usually it was the victim against the defendant himself or herself, no lawyer speaking for either side, that was the norm. The defendant had a right to hire a lawyer but usually couldn't afford it and didn't. There weren't rules of evidence."
Social Studies,"There weren't complicated motions. There weren't technical jury instructions. The trials themselves took, as I said an hour, two hours. Pre-trial proceedings did not involve lots of legal motions 'cause there were no lawyers to run them. The judges themselves often didn't have legal training. There were no law schools in America."
Social Studies,"When you have a system like that, it's not that cumbersome there's very little incentive to bypass it, and you don't have professional lawyers who are looking to get this case done with and get on to the next case or who have seen enough cases that they can bargain back and forth and strike a bargain for this case that's about where the previous cases came out. You didn't have an incentive for plea bargaining, it wasn't slow enough."
Social Studies,"You didn't have the experts who it would take to run plea bargaining and you didn't have the lack of investment in your own case that makes plea bargaining possible or the technical rules. These cases actually all did go to juries and the expectation was they all would go to juries and the jury right wasn't just a right of a defendant, this happened in every case 'cause the public had a right to do justice itself as well as seeing justice done. - [Kim] I have so many questions about this."
Social Studies,"For one thing, do you think our current system is an improvement on this older system of juries and not so much plea bargaining, and also why is there so much plea bargaining today? - [Jeffrey] At the time of the Founding, there were no deals to be made short of a full trial."
Social Studies,"That's a huge contrast with today where over 90% of criminal cases in this country are not resolved by trial but rather by what's called a plea bargain which is a defendant coming in and saying, ""Look, I will plead guilty to a lesser offense, or to the same offense you're charging but with a guarantee of lesser punishment as long as you don't require me to go through a full trial."" The idea is, is that because the system has grown so large and there are so many cases, that it's a relief to the prosecution and the court system not to have to have a trial in every case and the benefit to the defendant is that he gets a slightly better deal or is able to plead to a lesser crime."
Social Studies,"- [Stephanos] Over the course of the 19th century prosecutors are really taking over most of these cases. It goes from a few percent to the lion's share of cases, and then defense lawyers get hired more and more to counteract that. Once you got prosecutors and defense lawyers on both sides, and the Sixth Amendment guarantees you the right to hire a defense lawyer, that's how it's understood in the 18th and 19th centuries."
Social Studies,"The prosecutors and defense lawyers develop rules of evidence and they develop procedures and jury instructions and they argue motions. They get more active and the judge gets more passive or reactive. The judge isn't pushing the case along as much and the prosecutor and defense lawyer are slowing it down. That seems like it makes it fairer, but once it gets to a certain point of being slow the prosecutors wanna get rid of the cases, they have too many of them."
Social Studies,"The judges, they have a bunch of civil cases they need to get rid of and so the prosecutors and the judges and the defense lawyers all get together and find ways to bargain the case away rather than spending, now it's days on each case for trial. From their point of view it makes sense."
Social Studies,"They have a faster system and everyone goes home happy and the prosecutor can pursue more cases and the defendant gets a lighter deal but the prosecution makes sure there's some conviction and sentence, but from the point of view of the public, the public doesn't see justice done and the public doesn't trust these plea bargains. At the end of the day, what the defense lawyer's mostly doing is not making sure there's a speedy and public trial but bargaining 95% of cases away before there's a trial."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] What happens if the defendant can't afford a legal counsel? - [Jeffrey] The history of the right to counsel is actually one of the more interesting components of the Sixth Amendment because many of the components have deep roots in the history of England and so were rights that Englishmen enjoyed for many, many years before they were brought over to the colonies and became part of our Constitution of the United States. The right to counsel is a little bit different in that respect."
Social Studies,"Criminal defendants in England and other countries around the time of our founding often did not have a right to counsel of any kind whether they could pay for it or not. This was a bit of an innovation on the part of the Framers, recognizing that all of the other rights they were identifying to defend yourself in court might not amount to much if you didn't have expert assistance or at least the right to obtain expert assistance."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] You've described a lot of changes to how our legal system works over the years. What do you think would have surprised the Framers most about how our legal system works today? - [Stephanos] I think they would have been shocked that a system that was meant to slow down and check governmental power and protect overreaching and protect the people's role, has been so subverted that the people are involved in a few percent of cases."
Social Studies,They designed a system that's slower and less efficient by design than the criminal justice system of continental Europe because they were worried about the king and the Crown pushing around citizens and abusing their power. They wanted grand juries to authorize every criminal charge. We've largely gotten around that in most cases. They wanted petty juries to ensure that every prosecutor's charge was justified and that the legislature's criminal laws weren't being applied too broadly.
Social Studies,"Again, prosecutors now have so many threats and tools and sentences that they can make almost everybody give up their jury trial rights, but the Framers also weren't dealing with the volume of cases we're talking about, and they weren't focused primarily on the violent crimes."
Social Studies,"The federal crimes they were dealing with were seditious libel, criticizing the government, violations of the revenue laws, so it's also fair to point out that they did not expect that these rights were mainly gonna be limitations that benefited people in rape and murder cases. A lot of these protections are mainly designed to make sure that the innocent people get vindicated against unjust charges."
Social Studies,"They might be a little bit surprised that almost all the litigation is by people who may be factually guilty. - [Jeffrey] The next thing that would have surprised the Framers a great deal, I think, is the role of the jury today. The jury trial right mentioned in the Sixth Amendment is actually one of the only things mentioned twice in the Constitution. The right to a jury trial is actually mentioned in the body of the Constitution itself in Article Four, then it's mentioned again in the Sixth Amendment."
Social Studies,"The reason why is because the jury were truly the people's check on the court system and in particular on the prosecutorial power. Serving on a jury, to the Framers, was an honor. It was an act of deep political participation and meaning. In a way that we joke about jury service today as being something of a nuisance, they viewed it as almost as important as voting for the president on Election Day."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] By guaranteeing speedy public trials by jury and due process by law, the Sixth Amendment ensures that citizens, not the government, control criminal justice, but today as Professor Fisher and Judge Bibas note, the Framers might be surprised to learn that due to the rise of plea bargaining, only a small percentage of cases go to trial by jury, circumventing this process."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Sixth Amendment, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the case, I spoke with two experts. Jeffrey Rosen is the president and CEO of the National Constitution Center who's written extensively about the Supreme Court. Paul Cassell is the Ronald N. Boyce Presidential Professor of Criminal Law at The University of Utah School of Law. He's a leading researcher on criminal procedure and crime victims rights."
Social Studies,"So Jeff, if we actually go back to the time of this case what was going on at this time in constitutional law, why was the Miranda case so important? - [Jeff] The Miranda case was hugely important because it represented the high water mark of the Warren Court's criminal procedure revolution. The 1960's were a time when there was a lot of concern about the third degree."
Social Studies,Southern states were interrogating African American defendants in ways that struck many people as unfair but the Supreme Court took a long time to respond.
Social Studies,"- [Paul] Historically the admissibility of confessions into a trial had been determined by what is called, The Voluntariness Test and that required a judge to decide was the confession voluntarily given or had the police used unfair, overly aggressive tactics to extract it but making those kinds of determinations had proven challenging for some courts and so there was interest in coming up with, I guess what you might call a bright-line rule, a single test for determining whether confessions were or were not voluntary."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] The court didn't really settle on a standard for deciding whether or not a confession was voluntary or not. A test emerged and it was called, the Totality of The Circumstances Test which basically gave judges a lot of discretion to weigh different factors."
Social Studies,"Was the defendant well educated, what was his physical health, his emotional characteristics but lots of people were uncomfortable with the amorphousness of this test and at a time when there's renewed concern in the 1960's about the unfairness of the third degree, there's pressure to come up with a crisper and more constitutionally rooted way ensuring that confessions are not only involuntary in the sense of not being beaten out of the suspect but not involuntary in the sense of not reflecting the subtle coercive pressures of the confession room."
Social Studies,- [Paul] So Miranda was arrested on suspicion of rape and at the time the law on confessions was somewhat in flux. He appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court and then ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court which agreed to review his case and determine the issue. - [Kim] So who was Ernesto Miranda? What was his background? - [Jeff] Ernesto Miranda was a 23 year old Hispanic man. He was accused of raping a woman called Patricia.
Social Studies,"That was a pseudonym for her real name, she was basically forced into a car after getting off of a bus and assaulted in this terrible way. - [Paul] Miranda was a laborer, he was poorly educated I think is fair to say and I think it's also important to remember that he was a rapist. There doesn't seem to be any doubt that he in fact had sexually assaulted a young 18 year old girl as she was walking home from work late one night."
Social Studies,"He grabbed her off the street, threw her into the back of his car and drove her out into the desert and raped her and so those are all things that I think are important to recall when we talk about the Miranda decision. - [Jeff] And he was identified after a friend of hers saw a car similar to the one that she described a week later and the police tracked the registration down to Miranda's girlfriend who identified him."
Social Studies,"- [Paul] So the police got the report of the crime from the victim and they also had report of an unusual car that was involved and so eventually they were able to identify a car that was similar to that described by the victim that came back as registered to Miranda and so they picked him up for questioning, they took him into the station house. He denied having any involvement but then the police pulled a ploy, they had the victim come and look at Miranda along with a couple of other people in a lineup."
Social Studies,"A group of similarly appearing people and the victim thought that maybe Miranda was the person who'd committed the crime but she wasn't sure. So the police went back to Miranda and they said, ""Well, she's identified you."" and Miranda at that point said, ""Well I guess I better tell you what happened then."" and he made a confession to the rape as well as to some other crimes as well. - [Jeff] The question was whether this confession was consistent with the Fifth Amendment."
Social Studies,"He might or might not have met the totality of the circumstances test as Justice Harlan noted in his dissent. Miranda was 23 years old, indigent, educated to the extent of completing half the ninth grade, had an emotional illness of the schizophrenic type and the question was whether he made a knowing and intelligent waiver of these rights but the Supreme Court decided not to stick to that old totality of the circumstances test and rethink the entire way that confessions should be evaluated."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So the Supreme Court was kind of looking for an example case right, to try to figure out what this line should be about confessions and how the police should treat suspects."
Social Studies,Why did they choose this case in particular? - [Jeff] The court chose the Miranda case 'cause it came up at the right time at a time when all of the judges were increasingly impatient with this totality of the circumstances test including the great liberal textualist Hugo Black who had been a opponent of the voluntariness test 'cause he just thought it was too subjective. So they took the case.
Social Studies,It was certainly not a sympathetic one in the sense that Miranda was not the most sympathetic defendant but the court thought the time was right and they decided in Miranda to rethink the Fifth Amendment law.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Wow, so during his case what did Miranda argue? So why did he think that his confession should be thrown out? - [Paul] Well Miranda's case attracted a lot of attention because everyone knew the Supreme Court were very interested in the law of confessions and trying to come up with a new rule for addressing some of the issues and so he had a very good lawyer, John Flynn. Flynn interestingly enough argued that Miranda's right to counsel had been violated."
Social Studies,"It was only the police and Miranda who were in the interview room talking to each other and there was no lawyer there and so Flynn argued that this violated Miranda's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. However as the case developed and ultimately the opinion was released, the Supreme Court rejected the Sixth Amendment argument and instead went with the Fifth Amendment argument."
Social Studies,The court said that what had been violated by the procedures here was Miranda's right against being compelled to incriminate himself and the court said that there needed to be certain warnings given to Miranda and certain procedures followed to make sure that confessions given by suspects like him were admissible in court.
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] Flynn never said the confession was compelled in the sense that it was coerced by threats or promises or compulsion or at gunpoint but the fact that he gave the confession without knowing his rights, to silence or having an attorney present while in police custody made him in effect surrender a right that he didn't fully realize and appreciate."
Social Studies,"The State was represented by very prominent attorney Telford Taylor and he said that you should retain the totality of the circumstances test and not change the law but the Supreme Court disagreed and on June 13th 1966, it announced its five to four decision in the Miranda case. - [Kim] So what actually happened to Ernesto Miranda after this Supreme Court case? - [Jeff] Well the fallout from the decision was interesting."
Social Studies,"Miranda assumed that he was going to be released because the Supreme Court had ruled his confession inadmissible and that was a pivotal piece of evidence without which the prosecution was not going to be able to prove that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and so Miranda's father ordered a bottle of whisky that they were going to open to celebrate his release. But unfortunately for Miranda and I suspect fortunately for the citizens of Phoenix, Miranda had made a few statements along the way."
Social Studies,"He had threatened his common-law wife that he was going to get out and was going to come back and try to take the kids away from her and she went to police and reported that Miranda had confessed the crime to her and of course a confession to a private citizen, a common-law wife is not the same thing as a confession to a police officer and so the case was retried. Miranda's confession to his common-law wife was used in evidence against him."
Social Studies,"Miranda was convicted and I guess it's fair to say that bottle of whisky went unopened. - [Kim] Alright this is very interesting because we see this a lot on TV procedurals and also just in our sort of everyday policing. So how is this Miranda rule applied today? Has it developed at all over time? - [Paul] Yes, what the Supreme Court said was basically two things were going to have to happen before a confession given by someone who was in police custody could be admitted at a trial."
Social Studies,"The first is that the suspect would have to be given Miranda warnings. That is, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you. You have a right to an attorney before you answer any questions and if you cannot afford an attorney one will provided for you."
Social Studies,So those are the famous Miranda warnings that I think a lot of have seen those on TV shows or other programs and there is a second feature though of Miranda that I think is much more important and in some ways much more harmful to society. It's what is known as the waiver requirement.
Social Studies,"Police officers must ask a suspect, ""Do you agree to answer questions?"" and if the suspect says no then the police can't ask that suspect any questions no matter how briefly, no matter how reasonable the questions might be and so it's this warning and waiver procedure that the Supreme Court put in place. - [Jeff] So that core right remains the law of the land. - [Paul] So there are some situations where Miranda is not in place. One of them is if a suspect is not in custody."
Social Studies,For example if the police are responding to a crime and question people on the scene there. That's not a situation where there is what's known in the Miranda opinion as the inherent compulsion of police questioning. That's just ordinary citizen police interaction and special warnings aren't required there.
Social Studies,"Also a suspect's agreed to come down to the police station and talk, there's no requirement of a Miranda warning and in very rare situations, if there is an extremely pressing public safety need police officers need not give Miranda warnings. For example if they've apprehended a terrorist who's hidden a bomb, police can ask questions without giving the Miranda warnings."
Social Studies,- [Kim] How has the Miranda case and later cases that interpret Miranda reflect the way that the court balances individual liberty and the constitutional rights of defendants with public safety and the needs of law enforcement? - [Paul] When the Supreme Court looked at the Miranda case there were two competing concerns at play.
Social Studies,"One was to make sure that suspects like Miranda were treated fairly but the other was to make sure that law enforcement agencies could effectively investigate crime and what resulted out of Miranda was I think it's fair to say, something of a compromised decision. There were some who argued that police officers should never be able to question suspects once they were taken into custody that suspects should receive a lawyer and of course a lawyer would immediately tell a suspect, don't say anything at all."
Social Studies,Miranda didn't go that far and I think the reason it didn't go that far is there are very significant countervailing concerns. A lot of crimes cannot be solved unless a suspect is willing to give some statements and provide information that police can check out. The Miranda case itself is a good illustration of that.
Social Studies,"The victim in that case, because the crime was committed at nighttime and in the dark was unable to give a positive identification of Miranda and it was only when police were able to get a statement from him that they were in a position to move forward and prosecute him and to take a dangerous rapist off the streets of Phoenix, Arizona."
Social Studies,- [Jeff] Listeners should definitely check out Professor Cassell's study written with Richard Fowles in 1998 called Handcuffing The Cops which looked at FBI data for crime clearance rates in the two years after Miranda which fell significantly and they concluded that Miranda warnings were the main cause of this decline.
Social Studies,"But it's really important to stress that other scholars have questioned the study and have also noted that even if Miranda initially made it more difficult for officials to interrogate suspects, the police have since adjusted to Miranda."
Social Studies,"In fact they've come often to embrace it concluding that basically saying the magic words and mirandizing suspects frees up the police to employ a range of sophisticated strategies to get people to confess anyway and for this reason when the Miranda case was reaffirmed, far from being upset, the police in many cases welcomed the certainty that Miranda provides."
Social Studies,"So for all these reasons I think it's fair to say, just descriptively that Miranda regardless of the empirical dispute about whether or not it has discouraged confessions has been accepted by law enforcement by and large. It's been affirmed by the Supreme Court and at least for the immediate future, it's here to stay."
Social Studies,- [Kim] So we've learned that the ruling in Miranda versus Arizona arose out of concern that suspects in police custody might confess out of coercion or lack of knowledge about their own rights. The decision in Miranda that suspects must be informed of their rights helps to protect individuals accused of a crime from surrendering their Fifth Amendment right not to self incriminate.
Social Studies,But has Miranda harmed the ability of police to investigate crimes by preventing them from obtaining important information? Professor Cassell suggests that the broad application of Miranda has hampered police investigations. By contrast Jeff Rosen argues that police have adjusted to working within the confines of Miranda and use other techniques to investigate crime.

Social Studies,"Clarke Forsythe is Senior Counsel for Americans United for Life and the author of Abuse of Discretion: The Inside Story of Roe V. Wade. Melissa Murray is the Alexander F. and May T. Morrison Professor of Law at Berkeley Law School, where she also serves as the Faculty Director for the Center for Reproductive Rights and Justice. Mr. Forsythe, could you set the stage for us a little bit."
Social Studies,"What was going on at this time period? - [Clarke] Well, there were efforts in the 1960s to repeal abortion laws in the states and when abortion activists were dissatisfied with those efforts, they decided to go into the courts. And around 1969, they took some cases into the courts and ultimately, there were 20 or more cases challenging state laws in the courts between 1969 and 1973 and Roe versus Wade was the case from Texas. - [Melissa] Roe was litigated in the early 1970s."
Social Studies,"It was a period of enormous change in the United States. We were beginning to see beginnings of the women's rights movements, the beginning of the gay rights movement, and of course, the civil rights movement of the 1960s was moving in a lot of different directions. At the time, the question of abortion was very much on the minds of lots of different state legislatures because there had been moves to liberalize much of the criminal law that dealt with matters of sex and sexuality, including abortion."
Social Studies,"At the time, four states, New York, Alaska, Hawaii, and I believe Washington, had actually taken steps to repeal their laws criminalizing abortion. And about 13 other states had taken efforts to liberalize their laws criminalizing abortions, but in number of other states, around, at least 20 or more, there remained on the books, laws that absolutely criminalized abortion, except in situations where it would be necessary to preserve the woman's health or life, or in cases of rape, incest, or fetal anomaly."
Social Studies,"- [Clarke] Abortion rights attorneys sought plaintiffs who could challenge the Texas law and the Georgia law. There were two attorneys from Texas who found Norma McCorvey, who they gave the pseudonym of Jane Roe, for purposes of protecting her privacy. And she became the nominal plaintiff. - [Melissa] And so Norma McCorvey brought this case. She was a 22 year old woman living in Dallas County, Texas, who found herself pregnant for the third time."
Social Studies,"She was unmarried, her first child had been born, a daughter, and she had ultimately signed over custody of her daughter to her mother to raise, because she was having a bit of itinerant life, was unable to take care of her child. The second child that she bore, she gave up for adoption. And so when she found herself pregnant for a third time, she wasn't willing to do either of these things again and wanted to safely and legally terminate her pregnancy. But this was impossible under the Texas law."
Social Studies,"Texas had, since the 19th century absolutely criminalized abortion except in cases where it was necessary for the health and safety of the mother. And so she then was faced with the question of what was she going to do. And the only thing she could think to do then, was to actually challenge the law. So she was put in contact with Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, two young women who had recently graduated from law school."
Social Studies,"Sarah Weddington was only 26 years old at the time she helped Norma McCorvey bring this case. But they decided to sue the State of Texas to challenge the constitutionality of Texas' criminal abortion ban. - [Clarke] But as the history shows, there was no trial, there was no evidence, there were no expert witnesses. Jane Roe never testified. As you know, she never got an abortion. She gave birth and placed her child for adoption."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Okay, so Roe was Norma McCorvey, who was Wade? - [Clarke] Henry Wade was the District Attorney for Dallas, Texas, where the case was filed in Federal District Court."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this case, I assume kind of wends it's way through the courts and how did the Supreme Court rule? - [Clarke] The Justices declared the Texas and Georgia laws unconstitutional and then rewrote a national law, a national abortion law, in which they said that the states could not regulate or limit abortion in the first trimester."
Social Studies,"They could regulate more in the second trimester, the second three months of pregnancy, to protect maternal health and they could regulate in the last three months of pregnancy, the last trimester, to protect maternal health or fetal life."
Social Studies,"The attorneys for the plaintiffs claimed that abortion fell within the right to privacy, even though privacy is not in the text of the Constitution, they said it was derived, or based in the language of the 14th amendment of the Constitution even though the 14th amendment doesn't say anything about abortion, or the unborn child, it just uses the term liberty. And ultimately the Court said that the right to abortion is part of the right to privacy based on the 14th amendment."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] That's very interesting. So I've learned through many of these interviews, that this right to privacy is something that is never actually explicitly stated throughout the Bill of Rights, but there's a penumbra of privacy that you see in a few ways."
Social Studies,"What was the Court's reasoning that it was abortion that could fall under this zone of privacy? - [Clarke] If you read the Roe opinion, on page 152 of the Roe opinion, Justice Blackmun starts out by saying that, he cites a string of cases since about 1910, a string of Supreme Court cases and says that these lead to the right of privacy and we think abortion, or that the right of privacy is broad enough to encompass abortion."
Social Studies,"But then four pages later, on page 156, Blackmun turns around and says, but abortion because it involves the taking of a life, is inherently different from all those other cases that make up the right of privacy. - [Melissa] So the right of privacy doesn't actually come from Roe versus Wade, it comes from a case decided about eight years earlier, in 1965 called, Griswold versus Connecticut."
Social Studies,"In Griswold, at issue was a Connecticut state statute that made it a crime to use contraception or even to counsel patients about contraception. Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut opened up a birth control clinic in New Haven, Connecticut. They were promptly arrested and the clinic was closed and then they were able to bring this case. And they argued that the right to be able to use contraception was the right of the individual."
Social Studies,"The right of the doctor to advise patients about contraception was also an individual right. And the Court, in an opinion authored by William O. Douglas agrees with them. And the Court articulates for the first time this right of privacy and this is a right that the majority in Griswold says is actually been percolating in the Court's decisions for some time."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Did any of the Justices dissent in the Roe decision and if so, why? - [Clarke] Well there were two dissents by Justice White and by Justice Rehnquist and Justice White said that the Court was engaging in raw judicial power and that the Justices did not have the right or the authority to strike down the abortion laws of the States and could not rely upon a doctrine called, substantive due process."
Social Studies,"Justice Rehnquist said that there is clear historical evidence that many states passed abortion limits and prohibitions precisely at the time of the framing of the 14th amendment in the 1860s leading up to 1868 and that the evidentiary history, this history of state limits and prohibitions on abortion contradicted any proposition that the 14th amendment was intended to include a right to abortion and that was kind of the heart of his dissent."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So Roe was not the last word on abortion in the United States. There have been several later cases that were important to this as well, like Planned Parenthood versus Casey, or Whole Woman's Health versus Hellerstedt. Can you talk a little bit about how those cases have altered the scope of the right to abortion? - [Melissa] As soon as Roe is decided in 1973, there is an effort to sort of roll it back and hem it in a little bit."
Social Studies,"Frank Church, who's a Senator from Idaho, announces the Church amendment, which basically says that physicians don't have to perform abortions if doing so would conflict with their conscience or conscientious beliefs. So, again, that's one opportunity to sort of limit the reach of this right, by limiting the number of providers who are available to offer abortions. - [Clarke] In fact the Court has kind of cut back on Roe versus Wade in four cases over the years."
Social Studies,"Harris versus McRae involving abortion funding. Planned Parenthood versus Casey and in other cases, they've given more deference to the states, allowed the states to pass more and more limits at least around the margins, even though they've continued holding to the basic right that Roe created, that there was a right to abortion for virtually any reason, at any time of pregnancy."
Social Studies,"That's still the scope of the right, but they've allowed marginal regulations, like limits on public funding, parental notice and consent, informed consent laws. But then the Court flip flopped in 2016, in June of 2016 in Whole Woman's Health versus Hellerstedt. - [Melissa] The case makes its way to the Supreme Court and in an opinion that's authored by Justice Stephen Breyer and it's only an eight person Court because Justice Scalia passes away in February of 2016, so just eight people on the Court."
Social Studies,"In this decision, it's a five to three decision, Justice Stephen Breyer notes that the provisions that were challenged do not offer the medical benefits that they claimed to offer, sufficient to justify the burdens on access that each of those provisions imposes. - [Kim] What do you see as the future of Roe versus Wade? - [Clarke] Well, the Court has failed as the national abortion control board. It can not monitor abortion."
Social Studies,"It can't intervene, it can't regulate or legislate itself, it can't act as public health administrators It can't investigate and I believe it's absolutely certain that the Court, sooner or later, will have to overturn the Roe versus Wade decision because of this failure and return the issue to the states."
Social Studies,"- [Melissa] When we are talking about repealing or reforming these laws in the 1960s and 70s, it's also around a social movement where one of the critical questions is, what will be the role of women going forth in a modern society. When the questions of contraception come before the Court, one of the questions is whether women will be allowed to choose when and how to have children, whether they can space the timing of births to accommodate careers."
Social Studies,"It's the same issue that comes up in abortion, like this allowing women freedom to be able to go into the workforce, to determine when and how they will become mothers. And so, it's not surprising that the same questions that arose in 19th century about the place of women, about what happens in a society that's undergoing change, whether its immigration or changes in the demography of the country, are also coming up in the 1960s and 1970s at a time of incredible social change."
Social Studies,"And I think abortion and these rights involving a woman's role really do come to the fore and are incredibly controversial. - [Kim] So we've learned that the decision to legalize abortion in Roe versus Wade was based on the right of privacy, which the court has inferred from the due process clause of the 14th amendment. Since the Roe decision, a number of other cases have set limits on abortion and abortion clinics."
Social Studies,"Clarke Forsythe argues that the Supreme Court has failed in regulating abortion and that the issue should be returned to the states. Melissa Murray, by contrast, suggests that the decision in Roe is crucial to giving women the freedom to join the workforce and make decisions about when to have children.

Social Studies,"""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, ""and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, ""are citizens of the United States ""and of the state wherein they reside."
Social Studies,"""No state shall make or enforce any law ""which shall abridge the privileges ""or immunities of citizens of the United States, ""nor shall any state deprive any person of life, ""liberty, or property, without due process of law, ""nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction ""the equal protection of the laws."" So, let's just focus in on parts of it."
Social Studies,"So, one big takeaway about the 14th Amendment, this is the federal government saying, ""Hey, these are things that the state cannot do."" So, for example, when it says, ""Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, ""liberty, or property, without due process of law,"" this is a restatement of the 5th Amendment, that, ""Hey, you know, people can't just stick you ""in jail or take away your property without you going ""through some type of a process, a legal process."" Well, in the 5th Amendment, this was really talking about the federal government not being able to just take your property or your liberty away from you without the process of law, but here, it's saying, ""Nor shall any state."" And this clause right over here, this is known as the due process clause of the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"Then, right after that, it says, ""Nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction ""the equal protection of the laws. ""The equal protection of the laws,"" I'm gonna underline that. And this, you might guess is called the equal protection clause. Now, the context in which the 14th Amendment was ratified, it happens in 1868, shortly after the end of the Civil War."
Social Studies,"You, of course, have the 13th Amendment that, among other things, abolishes slavery, but then, you have these things in the south called black codes, which continue to repress the rights of African-Americans, and that's why Congress felt the need for the 14th Amendment to be passed. Now, one of the most notable cases in which the 14th Amendment was brought up happens in 1896, Plessy v. Ferguson, and we have a whole video about this."
Social Studies,"And this is a case in which it was argued that is was unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment for African-Americans to have to travel in a separate train car from white Americans, and the Supreme Court infamously said that, ""Hey, as long as it is equal, ""it is okay for it to be separate ""and that it would not violate the 14th Amendment,"" and so, this idea of separate but equal comes about. Now, that was significantly challenged as we go into 1954, where you have Brown v."
Social Studies,"Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Board of Education. And here, the argument was that, inherently, separate could not be equal, and once again, the 14th Amendment was invoked. And this time, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that, yes, separate can't be equal, and that the schools needed to be desegregated. So, even though it wasn't an official overruling of Plessy v. Ferguson, it was a functional overruling of this doctrine of separate but equal."
Social Studies,"And, as we go into the 1960s civil rights movement, led by folks like Martin Luther King, it was the 14th Amendment that was cited often. In another video, we're going to look at Martin Luther King's letter from a Birmingham jail, in which he articulates the ideas of the civil rights movement, it's a quite moving letter."
Social Studies,"But, once again, it's evoking these ideas of the 14th Amendment, and it goes onto movements as disparate as the women's rights movement, led by organizations like the National Organization for Women, citing equal protection of the laws in situations of sexual discrimination in the workplace. You have pro-life groups citing the 14th Amendment, arguing that an unborn fetus' right to life is protected by the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"You have rulings around whether quotas in higher education are legal or not, once again, citing ideas of equal protection of the laws. So, as you go forth in your study of United States government, the 14th Amendment, especially Section 1, is going to keep showing up.."
Social Studies,"It is one of the most powerful documents, frankly, I have ever read. And Martin Luther King often gets a lot of credit as an amazing speaker. People say, ""Hey, he could read the phone book, ""and it would move people."" But this also speaks to what an incredible writer he was. Not only is it moving, but it really gives the philosophical underpinnings of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s."
Social Studies,And many people attribute the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed by Congress as being heavily influenced by Martin Luther King's letter.
Social Studies,"Now, what motivated Martin Luther King to write this letter was a statement made in the newspaper by eight Alabama clergymen, which encouraged the protesters to wait saying, ""That, yes, we are sympathetic to the injustices, ""but they should be resolved in the courts ""and not through the type of protests, ""the type of tension, that Martin Luther King ""and his fellow protesters were creating."" And so, here's just an excerpt of what Martin Luther King wrote, ""You may well ask, 'Why direct action? ""'Why sit ins, marches and so forth? ""'Isn't negotiation a better path?' ""You are quite right in calling for negotiation."
Social Studies,"""Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. ""Nonviolent direct action seeks to create ""such a crisis and foster such a tension ""that a community which has constantly refused ""to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. ""It seeks so to dramatize the issue ""that it can no longer be ignored. ""My citing the creation of tension ""as part of the work of the nonviolent resister ""may sound rather shocking."
Social Studies,"""But I must confess that I am ""not afraid of the word 'tension.' ""I have earnestly opposed violent tension, ""but there is a type of constructive, ""nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth."
Social Studies,"""Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary ""to create a tension in the mind so that ""individuals could rise from the bondage ""of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm ""of creative analysis and objective appraisal, ""so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies ""to create the kind of tension in society ""that will help men rise from the dark depths ""of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights ""of understanding and brotherhood."
Social Studies,"""The purpose of our direct action program ""is to create a situation so crisis packed ""that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation."
Social Studies,"""I guess it is easy for those who have never felt ""the stinging darts of segregation to say 'wait.' ""But when you have seen vicious mobs ""lynch your mothers and fathers at will ""and drown your sister and brothers at whim; ""when you have seen hate-filled policemen ""curse, kick, brutalize, and even kill ""your black brothers and sisters with impunity; ""when you see the vast majority of your 20 million ""Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage ""of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; ""when you suddenly find your tongue twisted ""and your speech stammering as you seek to explain ""to your six-year-old daughter why she cannot go ""to the public amusement park that has ""just been advertised on television; ""when you take a cross-country drive ""and find it necessary to sleep night after night ""in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile ""because no motel will accept you; ""when you are humiliated day in and day out ""by nagging signs reading 'white' and 'colored,' ""then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait."" I've read this many times, but every time I read it, and this is just an excerpt, as you can tell, it's incredibly powerful."
Social Studies,"And I encourage you to read it in its entirety, and think about why this was such a powerful document, especially for catalyzing things like the Civil Rights Act of 1964.."
Social Studies,"that opened the door for desegregation and the Modern Civil Rights Movement. In Brown, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools for white and black children, which had been prevalent throughout the American South since the 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson legalized segregation, were in fact inherently unequal."
Social Studies,"The named plaintiff in this case, Oliver Brown, was the father of Linda, a third-grader who had to take a bus to a segregated elementary school that was much farther from her home than the nearby school for white children. To learn more about the Brown case, I sought out the help of two experts. Theodore Shaw is the Julius L. Chambers Distinguished Professor of Law, and Director of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina School of Law."
Social Studies,"Michael McConnell is the Richard and Frances Mallery Professor, and Director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, and a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. So Prof. Shaw, could you just kinda set the stage for us? What was the overall social and political context behind this case? - [Prof. Shaw] Well Brown was decided in the Cold War era. I think that's important for reasons that I'll come back to."
Social Studies,"But it also was decided, I guess it was 58 years after the Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that separate but equal railway cars were constitutional. Of course that extended to all walks of life in the South. And so what you had was Jim Crow segregation sustained and set in place by law. And Brown was the case that cracked the edifice of Jim Crow segregation. So, it was an enormously important case. It came after a long campaign by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to overturn Plessy."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] One thing that I think is really confusing about Plessy v. Ferguson is how it interacts with the 14th Amendment. So immediately after the Civil War, Congress passed, and the states ratified, the 14th Amendment which gives equal protection under the law to all citizens. But then Plessy v. Ferguson just a couple decades later, legalizes segregation. Can you talk a little bit more about how the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment has been interpreted in Plessy, and then later in Brown v."
Social Studies,"Board? - [Prof. McConnell] The doctrine of separate but equal was itself a departure from the prior understanding of what the 14th Amendment meant. In the immediate wake of the 14th Amendment, segregation was understood to be a violation of equal rights. The Congress of the United States passed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which prohibited mandatory segregation of among other things, railroads."
Social Studies,"Now that was struck down in 1883, I believe it was 1886, but for reasons not related to separate but equal or segregation. But it's only in the late 1880s and 1890s that states began passing Jim Crow legislation, like the law in Plessy v. Ferguson. I think Plessy very likely would've come out a different way, had it come up 25 years earlier."
Social Studies,"It's really very difficult to understand the logic of Plessy, because Plessy takes the point of view that segregation is okay because it treats everyone the same way, and the sense of inferiority or insult that comes from segregation, the court just ignored. You can read the opinion different ways, and people do and have read the opinion different ways."
Social Studies,"A portion of the opinion makes it sound as though this is kind of social science conclusion, that segregation breeds a feeling of inferiority, that has a deleterious effect on the black students' performance in school. - [Prof. Shaw] There's a famous footnote in Brown v. Board of Education, Footnote 11 in which some social scientists, and particularly Dr."
Social Studies,"Kenneth Clark, did a series of tests, the doll tests, in which they showed black and white dolls who were otherwise identical to little children, little black children, and they asked who was the good doll, who was the bad doll, who was the pretty doll, who was the ugly doll. And the black children would invariably choose the white dolls as the better dolls, and the black dolls as the inferior dolls."
Social Studies,"And then finally the bombshell question, which one looks like you? And they would stop and choose the black doll, and many times, tears would come to their eyes. And so this old notion of the inferiority that segregation imbued in black school children was important, and the Supreme Court had some very eloquent language about that. - [Prof."
Social Studies,"McConnell] Everyone knew that the only reason to have laws requiring black and white to be separate, was because of the feeling on the part of the dominant white group, that the African race was inferior. I think it was a failure of political will really, rather than a matter of constitutional or legal logic that led to that. And then it took almost 60 years before the Supreme Court would turn itself around. - [Prof. Shaw] The late A."
Social Studies,"Leon Higginbotham who sat on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia, he used to say that Plessy was wrong the day it was decided. And I believe he was right about that. If you go back and look at the rationale stated in Plessy, it didn't hold up. It's not an intellectually honest decision, and having said that, if you look at Brown, it really did not overrule Plessy on its face with respect to segregation and Jim Crow across the board."
Social Studies,"What it did was say that in the field of public education, separate but equal is unconstitutional. Separate schools cannot be equal. And what followed Brown was a series of cases in all kinds of areas in which the court sometimes without much of an opinion, cited Brown, but struck down segregation in public libraries and public accommodations, and transportation, et cetera."
Social Studies,"The case that settled the long-running boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, that catapulted Martin Luther King into the national and world stage, it was decided, it was resolved finally. The boycott was important, but it was resolved by this case that the Supreme Court decided and had cited Brown. - [Kim] And so, Thurgood Marshall and the Legal Defense Fund had kind of been chipping away at the edges of segregation, and then they turned directly to school segregation in the Brown cases."
Social Studies,"So what kind of arguments did they use to challenge the system of school segregation? - [Prof. McConnell] Thurgood Marshall and his co-council in the NAACP established a very careful strategy of one case at a time, sort of pushing the envelope of this idea that segregation is inconsistent with demands of equal protection."
Social Studies,"And the interesting thing about Brown itself, the case challenging segregation in Topeka, Kansas, you know, why Topeka, Kansas? Why was this such an excellent place to raise the challenge? And the reason is that the schools in Topeka were very substantially equal in quality. In Topeka they actually had integrated high schools and middle schools."
Social Studies,"It was only the elementary schools that were segregated, and the District Court found, and the Supreme Court did not disagree that in terms of their material advantages, the black school was essentially just as good as the white school. And that's why the NAACP wanted to go after Topeka, because then it went to the principle of the thing."
Social Studies,"You know it's one thing to attack segregation when separate but equal is really just a fiction, but when separate but equal is a reality, at least pretty close to it, as in Topeka, you have to go after the actual principle that segregation is wrong in principle and not just wrong because it tends most of the time to lead to material disadvantage. - [Prof. Shaw] Brown was actually five cases. The Brown case itself came from Topeka, Kansas."
Social Studies,"In many ways, the Supreme Court might've chosen to lead with the Brown case because it wasn't part of the South, and so in some ways it might've been viewed as taking pressure off of the South. But there were five cases altogether. There was a case out of South Carolina, a case out of Virginia, a case out of Delaware, a case out of Washington DC, and then the Topeka case. And the Brown family was actually not even the only family named Brown in the Topeka case."
Social Studies,"And the other Brown case did not have their father available as the lead voice, and they wanted a man, and so Oliver Brown was the one they chose. They stipulated that the schools were in fact equal in all respects, and of course they weren't. It was never possible to make separate but equal, equal."
Social Studies,"But they stipulated that these schools were equal, the black and the white schools, because they wanted the court to be able to, or to have to, confront the issue of whether separate but equal per se was unconstitutional. - [Kim] Interesting, so it's this place where they're hoping not to have a ruling that for example, oh the schools for black children need to be brought up to code, to be the same as white children, but they're trying to strike down the idea of segregation altogether."
Social Studies,"And indeed they rule unanimously that separate but equal facilities are inherently unequal. - [Prof. McConnell] The Supreme Court in Brown says well whatever may have been the status of education as a civil right back then, back in the 19th century, by now it surely is a civil right, and therefore there can be no discrimination with regard to it."
Social Studies,"And one other thing that changed that I think the Supreme Court doesn't refer to, but many historians think was surely in the back of their minds, has to do with foreign policy of all things, that during this time the United States in the wake of World War II was playing a very major role in opposing colonialism, opposing communism, in trying to spread the gospel of liberty around the world. And when we had segregation at home, this looked like rank hypocrisy. - [Prof. Shaw] This was the Cold War period."
Social Studies,"These soldiers came home from fighting a form of racism in Europe, Nazi Germany, you know the Holocaust. And when they came back, they came back to segregated America. And there are many stories that are painful about what their experiences were. But meanwhile the United States is having this Cold War with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union was exploiting this inconsistency in what America said it was, and what it was."
Social Studies,"And though the Supreme Court never said a word about that in the Brown cases, that was very much context for that decision. - [Kim] So what did it take for desegregation to really come about? Do you think we've achieved desegregation? - [Prof. Shaw] Yes and no. There was a long battle to implement Brown, and in fact for the most part, Brown was not implemented fully to the extent it ever was until the early 1970s when the Supreme Court decided a case called Swann v."
Social Studies,"Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education in North Carolina, and sanctioned the use of busing. - [Prof. McConnell] This does not depend upon what social scientists might think about how people do in school."
Social Studies,"This is a much more fundamental principle of equality under the law, that our law must treat black and white the same, that for the government to draw racial distinctions is fundamentally unequal, and unconstitutional, and wrong, and unjust, fundamentally so and not just as a matter of social science evidence. - [Prof."
Social Studies,"Shaw] I don't wanna sound despairing, you know, but I think if anybody looks at our public schools today, and many of our communities, and our towns, and cities, and our counties, we have to acknowledge honestly that there's still a great deal of segregation, and there are many schools that are identifiably white, or identifiably black. And now Latinos, Hispanics, large degree of segregation there also."
Social Studies,"And even voluntary desegregation efforts have been found by the Supreme Court a few years ago to be largely unconstitutional and illegal, and that's tragic. But that doesn't mean that Brown wasn't significant. I was born in the year of Brown v. Board of Education. The America that I grew up in is a very different country than the one that proceeded it. In spite of our flaws and our warts, no Brown v. Board of Education, no Civil Rights Movement, I would say."
Social Studies,"And ultimately no desegregation of our society to the extent that we've accomplished it, and we have to a great degree, and no Barack Obama. So I think Brown stands, as I said, as a dividing point in America, but we can do better. - [Kim] So we've learned that under the leadership of Thurgood Marshall, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the decision in Brown v. Board of Education struck a major blow to the system of segregation."
Social Studies,"After World War II, amidst the ideological struggle of the Cold War, the Supreme Court overturned the precedent set in Plessy v. Ferguson, and ruled that segregated education constituted a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. To learn more about Brown v. Board, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"And what we're going to do in this video is think about how rulings by the Supreme Court represent both continuity over time, but also change over time, especially relative to the protection of minority rights. One of the most significant test cases of the 14th Amendment happens almost 30 years after the amendment is ratified in 1896. This is a situation where the state of Louisiana passes a law that African American people have to sit in a separate railcar from white people."
Social Studies,"And so you have this gentleman here, Homer Plessy, a resident of New Orleans, who decides to test this law. He sits in a white only car, and he is 1/8 African American. And he gets arrested. This case eventually goes to the United States Supreme Court, and they rule that the Louisiana law requiring separate cars is not unconstitutional as long as the cars are judged to be equal. And this is where that term ""separate but equal"" comes from."
Social Studies,"And this is viewed as a fairly infamous ruling because it was the Supreme Court reinforcing this idea of segregation, even after the 14th Amendment had been passed almost 30 years prior. Now, we go almost 60 years in the future in order for segregation to be challenged in a very significant way. Then we get to the case of Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas in 1954, in which the then Supreme Court rules that ""No, segregation is not okay."
Social Studies,"""Separate is inherently unequal."" And this right over here is a picture of a desegregated classroom around that time although this is not in Topeka, Kansas. But it shows how based on the passage of time, based on social norms, based on a change in the make-up of the Supreme Court, how they can make rulings that go one way or the other. Plessy versus Ferguson reaffirms segregation. It's perceived to curtail minority rights while Brown versus Board of Education goes the other way."
Social Studies,"Once again, taking a look at the 14th Amendment. Now, if we fast-forward to 1993, we have another really interesting test case, Shaw versus Reno. This is a situation where after the 1990 census North Carolina takes a look at its congressional districts and sends them to review by the federal Justice Department. The federal Justice Department decides that the first pass that North Carolina took at the districting only had one black majority congressional district."
Social Studies,"And they thought that there could be two black majority congressional districts. So, the state of North Carolina redistricted again, and they created this 12th district here, which you can see is kind of a strange shape. It's strung along over 160 miles in this very thin district. Now, this was taken to the Supreme Court by citizens of North Carolina saying that this districting was a severe case of gerrymandering, which we've talked about in other videos, and should be deemed unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"And the Supreme Court actually did rule in 1993 that redistricting purely on the basis of race, as was done in this situation, even though it was with the intent of having more minority representation in Congress, that this type of redistricting on the basis of race was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"This Supreme Court also cited the Equal Protection Clause and also cited the 14th Amendment saying, ""Look, once you start redistricting ""based on racial lines, it creates a type ""of racial separation, which is unconstitutional ""by the 14th Amendment."" So, these are really good cases to know. They show how the Supreme Court can rule differently depending on what time period we are in or depending on the circumstance."
Social Studies,"That often times when we think about equal protection, we think about protection of minority rights. But as we saw in the case of Shaw versus Reno, even when the intent of, in this case gerrymandering, is to give more minority representation, it was deemed unconstitutional because from the Supreme Court's point of view violated the 14th Amendment.."
Social Studies,At one end of the spectrum you could have outright quotas. These could be situations where say a university admissions department says we're going to say 10% of our class is gonna be from this group or from that group. In between you could have race or gender-aware admissions where it is a factor in admissions. Race/gender is a factor.
Social Studies,"And at this end of the spectrum there's outreach to groups to make sure that people who could be qualified who are from underrepresented groups are applying, so this would be outreach. Now, in popular language today, affirmative action tends to refer to things more on this end of the spectrum and the phrase affirmative action first comes into popular usage during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency."
Social Studies,"Now, as you can imagine this is a very sensitive topic because on one hand folks could say yes, it would be nice to give opportunity for folks who historically have not had opportunity or folks who are historically underrepresented but other people might say well, shouldn't we be a race blind society? If you are factoring race for one group, well, doesn't that hurt another group and couldn't it cause reverse discrimination? And to appreciate the legal history here, we can go back to 1978 where we have the case Regents of the University of California v."
Social Studies,Bakke in the United States Supreme Court and this is a situation where Bakke is a former solider and engineer who also happens to be white who wants to go to medical school. He gets rejected by the University of California at Davis and he claims that there was reverse discrimination at play because they had a quota system. 16 out of the 100 seats at the medical school were reserved for underrepresented minorities and the Supreme Court actually had trouble deciding on this case.
Social Studies,It was a very divided opinion and eventually Justice Powell's opinion became the opinion that people paid attention to. And it was a little bit mixed.
Social Studies,"It said that outright quotas are unconstitutional and that Bakke should be allowed admission and he was able to go to University of California, Davis Medical School but Justice Powell tried to thread the needle by saying even though quotas might be unconstitutional it is okay to consider race as a factor in admissions especially if it's being used for the educational benefit of diversity of the community."
Social Studies,"In 1996 the voters of California actually voted directly on this issuer and they passed the California Civil Rights Initiative more commonly know as Proposition 209 and this proposition made it illegal to consider race, sex or ethnicity when it came to government jobs or admissions in state schools. It has been challenged by proponents of affirmative action many time but all of those challenges have been unsuccessful to date."
Social Studies,These issues surface again in the Supreme Court in 2003 when we get to the Grutter versus Bollinger case. This case has some parallels to the Bakke case. In this case Grutter is a white applicant to the University of Michigan Law School who claims that she was denied admission because the Law School was giving racial preference which was causing essentially reverse discrimination.
Social Studies,The Supreme Court rules against Grutter but it's really interesting to read the majority opinion written by Sandra Day O'Connor and the dissenting opinion from Clarence Thomas because it gives us some texture into the nuances of these decisions. Here is an excerpt from Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion. We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago.
Social Studies,"In the landmark Bakke case, we reviewed a racial set-aside program that reserves 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of certain minority groups. Since this Court's splinter decision in Bakke, Justice Powell's opinion announcing the judgment of the court has served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies. And then she goes on to list the situations that Justice Powell said were not okay to justify race as a factor in admissions."
Social Studies,"Justice Powell rejected an interest in reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession as an unlawful interest in racial balancing. So, according to Justice Powell in the Bakke case, you can't justify race-conscious admissions to try to fix historic deficits."
Social Studies,Sandra Day O'Connor goes on to write Justice Powell in the Bakke case rejected an interest in remedying societal discrimination because such measures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties who bare no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered.
Social Studies,"So, you also can't have race-conscious admissions if the goal is to remedy current societal discrimination because if you're benefiting someone, you're also putting the burden on people who might have nothing to do with that societal discrimination. And then she goes on to write that in the Bakke case Justice Powell approved the university's use and here we're talking about the University of California's use of race to further only one interest, the attainment of a diverse student body."
Social Studies,"And now in this part of the excerpt she shifts to talking about the case at hand in Grutter versus Bollinger where we're talking about admissions to the University of Michigan Law School. As part of its goal of assembling a class that is both exceptionally academically qualified and broadly diverse, the Law School seeks to enroll a critical mass of minority students. The Law School's concept of critical mass is defined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce."
Social Studies,"These benefits are substantial. As the district court emphasized the Law School's admissions policy promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes and enables students to better understand persons of different races. We, the majority in the Supreme Court, agree that in the context of its individualized inquiry into the possible diversity contributions of all applicants, the Law School's race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm non-minority applicants."
Social Studies,"In summary, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment does not prohibit the Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body."
Social Studies,"So, in this situation the majority opinion that's penned by Justice O'Connor is clarifying Powell's statement in Bakke saying that diversity is a legitimate educational benefit that universities can optimize around as long as race is one of many factors in the admissions process. Now, on the other hand, you have the dissenting opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas. Here is an excerpt he wrote. I believe blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators."
Social Studies,"Because I wish to see all students succeed whatever their color, I share in some respect the sympathies of those who sponsor the type of discrimination advanced by the University of Michigan Law School. The Constitution does not, however, tolerate institutional devotion to the status quo in admissions policies when such devotion ripens into racial discrimination. So, he's calling the University of Michigan Law School's admissions policies outright discrimination."
Social Studies,"He's saying that look, even though it might be the status quo, it's essentially what a lot of universities have been doing since Bakke. It's not okay because it has ripened into racial discrimination. The majority, he's talking about the majority of the Supreme Court upholds the Law School's racial discrimination not by interpreting the people's Constitution, so the US Constitution but by responding to a faddish slogan of the cognoscenti."
Social Studies,"So, here he's making reference to this idea of diversity which he's calling a faddish slogan of the cognoscenti. Cognoscenti would be people who are in the know, or people who think they're in the know. Nevertheless, I concur in part in the Court's opinion. I agree with the Court's holding that racial discrimination in higher education admissions will be illegal in 25 years."
Social Studies,"And here he's making reference that in Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion she did say that in 25 years it might not be okay to have race-conscious admissions. I respectfully dissent from the remainder of the Court's opinion and the judgment, however, because I believe that the Law School's current use of race violates the Equal Protection Clause and that the Constitution means the same thing today as it will in 300 months."
Social Studies,"So, here he's saying look, if the majority thinks that it's right now okay to have race-conscious admissions but it's not okay in 25 years, well, what's gonna change about the Constitution? If it's going to be unconstitutional in 25 years, it should be unconstitutional today."
Social Studies,"Finally, he goes on to say the Constitution abhors classifications based on race not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all. I encourage you to think about it."
Social Studies,"Are you more on the side of Justice Powell or Sandra Day O'Connor where race is a legitimate factor in admissions especially if it's in service to diversity which is considered a benefit for an educational community or you more on the side of Justice Thomas and Proposition 209 in California saying that look, we need to be racially blind."
Social Studies,"The 14th Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment says that we should be a racially blind country and that every time we try to involve race, it might do more harm than good. You decide.."
Social Studies,"A person has citizenship as a member of a state, which gives them rights, responsibilities, and privileges. A citizen of the United States is entitled to the protections granted in the Constitution and Bill of Rights like freedom of speech. There are two paths to citizenship. People are either born citizens because their parents were citizens or because they were born on US soil or they can become naturalized citizens."
Social Studies,We'll talk more in other videos about the process to become a citizen but for now just know that naturalization is the legal process by which a foreign citizen or national can become a US citizen. The other definition of citizenship I wanna talk about here is not just the legal status of having citizenship but the practice of active citizenship. You practice good citizenship by being an informed and active member of a political community.
Social Studies,"So what does it mean to be a good citizen? There are a few aspects of good citizenship. First, a good citizen is empowered. That means that they exercise their rights and believe that they can make a difference by doing so. They don't say, ""Nah, I'm not gonna do anything. ""It wouldn't make a difference anyway."" A good citizen is also community-minded. They feel a sense of responsibility for their communities and they wanna help them be the best that they can be. They're also inclusive."
Social Studies,"And by that I mean that they wanna do what's best for everyone in their community, not just what would be most beneficial to themselves. They include multiple viewpoints and stand up for the rights of others. And lastly, a good citizen is informed. They know how the government works, they're up to date on the problems that the government is facing and the decisions that it's making."
Social Studies,Good citizens are invaluable to democracy because democracy works best when citizens are knowledgeable and active in political debate..
Social Studies,"Let's start with what it's not. It's not government or elected officials who are acting in their official capacity as representatives of the state or nation. That is the political sphere. It's also not businesses or corporations who exist primarily to make a profit, that's the economic sphere. And lastly, it's not purely private aspects of society, such as family or home life."
Social Studies,"Civil society exists in between these three spheres and includes all of the non-governmental groups, associations, and institutions that civilians form and join. If you and your friends decide to create a neighborhood cleanup club, picking up litter from the streets and planting trees in the park, congratulations, you've just joined civil society. Some other examples of civil society include religious organizations, professional associations, charitable groups, or interest groups."
Social Studies,"Non-governmental organizations or NGOs are some of the most notable actors in civil society. These include organizations like Doctors Without Borders. Some organizations overlap a bit with other spheres. Labor unions, for example, are voluntary organizations but they overlap with the economic sphere by petitioning businesses for better wages and working conditions."
Social Studies,"NGOs that have a humanitarian mission, like Amnesty International may overlap with the political sphere, since they petition governments to change how they treat their citizens. Some non-governmental actors are harder to classify like the news media. Where does it fall in civil society? It usually has some goal of making money but it also helps inform citizens about the workings of government and helps hold politicians accountable to the public. So the media plays a central role in civil society."
Social Studies,So what's important about civil society? Well all of these organizations help connect people to their communities and many of them strive to improve society by influencing these spheres. Often they're in conflict with one another but most importantly they show us that there are many ways beyond voting or running for office to become involved in issues that you care about..
Social Studies,"Civic life includes all the ways that you might take part in solving the problems of your community, whether that's by volunteering in civil society, making rules or laws, or serving in a government body, whether that's the school council or the U.S. Senate. So if you like playing video games, playing for fun is part of your private life. But if you joined a group petitioning for more representation of diverse characters in video games, you'd be entering into civic life."
Social Studies,"Then you're not just doing things that make you happy individually. You're striving to have an effect on the lives of others. So when you step into civic life, you will become involved with politics and government. Although you often hear them lumped together, they're not actually the same thing. You could say that politics is something that you do, an action. Politics encompasses all the ways that people reach agreements in a group, by negotiating, compromising, or voting."
Social Studies,"And those people might not agree with each other, but through the political process, they agree to be bound by the rules that they've negotiated together. So in the large scale, politics describes both how Congress debates bills and how you and your brother decide who does the dishes. Then there's government. Government is a noun, and it describes both the institutions like the Supreme Court or the city council which make and enforce laws, as well as the people who serve in those institutions."
Social Studies,"So government could describe both FIFA, the international governing body for soccer, as well as the referee whose job it is to enforce the rules that soccer teams and players agree to abide by. Okay, so now that you've learned about civic life, private life, politics, and government, here's a pop quiz. I'm gonna give you a few scenarios, and you see if you can match them to the correct term."
Social Studies,"First up, Ayla's church provides food and shelter for the homeless community during the winter to keep them out of the cold. Is this an example of civic life, private life, politics, or government? Pause the video here and see what you think. If you guessed civic life, you're correct. Ayla is participating in what we call civil society here, which you might remember from another video. Civil society includes all of the voluntary institutions that people form and join outside of government and the market."
Social Studies,"She's doing something for her community. Okay, next. The Supreme Court hears a case about internet copyright law and the First Amendment. Is this an example of civic life, private life, politics, or government? This is government. The Supreme Court is part of a governing body that enforces the rules. Okay, last one. Jeffrey, a representative for the AARP, reaches out to Senator Rodriguez to provide more information on the impact a bill making its way through the House will have on senior citizens."
Social Studies,"He wants to secure Senator Rodriguez's support when the bill reaches the Senate. Is this an example of civic life, private life, politics, or government? If you guessed politics, you're right. Jeffrey is providing information, hoping to influence a decision that will affect others. Okay, thanks for playing. Keep practicing your skills in the exercise for this lesson.."
Social Studies,"But what are those rights? The extent of and limits on rights can be very complex. That's why we have constitutional lawyers and Supreme Court cases to decide whether the government protects or prohibits certain activities. But we can make some generalizations about categories of rights in the American political system. In this and the videos that follow, we're gonna distinguish between three different types of rights, personal rights, political rights, and economic rights."
Social Studies,"So let's dive in to personal rights. This is a really big umbrella that includes individual's right to decide the best course of action for themselves. Personal rights define the ways that you should be free from government interference in your private life, your home, your mind, and your body."
Social Studies,"You'll recognize some of them from the Bill of Rights, particularly the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and religion, and the Fourth Amendment, which protects the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures."
Social Studies,"So what are some of these rights? I've tried to put them into a spectrum from freedom of body to freedom of mind and heart, although you'll see that there are lots of places where freedom of body and freedom of mind overlap. First, there's freedom of movement. This means that you can move to a different state or even move to a different country if you want to. The U.S. government won't force you to stay put. There's the freedom of association. That is to hang out with anyone you want to."
Social Studies,"There's the freedom to refuse medical care, to be able to control your own body. The government can't force you to undergo a medical procedure. Likewise, there's the freedom to have children, as many or as few as you want. There's also the freedom from government intrusion into your private domain, also known as the right to privacy. It means that the government can't come into your home without a warrant or otherwise interfere in your private life behind closed doors."
Social Studies,"There's the freedom of expression, the ability of an individual or group to express their beliefs, thoughts, ideas, and emotions. There's the freedom to access education. So people who are school age have the right to receive a public education no matter who they are or whether they have learning differences. There's the freedom to marry whomever you choose. And lastly, there's freedom of religion and conscience. This is your personal right to think and believe whatever you want."
Social Studies,"The United States doesn't have an established church, meaning one that the government supports financially or that citizens are obligated to attend. Some of these freedoms might seem like no-brainers, but people who live in authoritarian societies don't necessarily enjoy these same rights. If you've ever read George Orwell's novel ""1984,"" it's a good example of what society might look like without these rights."
Social Studies,"In it, the government spies on everyone in their homes and prevents anyone from speaking out against the ruling party. But it's also important to recognize that these rights aren't absolute. Many of them have limits, and what those limits should be sparks a lot of public debate. For example, when we talk about the right to refuse medical care, we might think about vaccines."
Social Studies,"Should people be required to get vaccines if not doing so poses a risk to the health of others? What about freedom of expression? Should people be able to say whatever they want, or should the government impose limits on hate speech? The personal rights of one person will frequently overlap with or even contradict the personal rights of someone else. So that's it for this brief overview of personal rights. In the next video, we'll discuss the political rights of citizens.."
Social Studies,"This means that you can join a political party or a special interest group that represents you. You're not obligated to belong to a particular party backed by the government, and you can't be discriminated against for belonging to a political organization. There are the first amendment rights to freedom of speech, press, assembly, and petition."
Social Studies,"This means that you can share political ideas, print political ideas, assemble for political purposes, like a conference or a protest march, and ask the government to correct a wrong without fear of punishment. One of the most important political rights is the right to vote. Citizens may vote as they choose according to the laws of their state. There's also the right to run for public office."
Social Studies,"Anyone who meets the criteria specified by the Constitution and their state or municipality may run for elected office without government interference. Now, you may be asking, ""Wait, what's the difference ""between political rights and civil rights?"" Well, civil rights overlap with these rights, as well as with personal rights, because civil rights protect people who belong to marginalized groups from discrimination."
Social Studies,"So, if a society permits some people to vote but not others, based on their race, sex, religion, or other characteristic, that society is infringing on the civil rights of those citizens by denying them their political rights. So, let's take a look at a few scenarios to practice our understanding of political rights. I'll give you a scenario and you see if you can identify which political rate is being exercised or violated. First, Parvati's best friend, Natalie, is running for city council."
Social Studies,"She wants to show her support, so, she checks Natalie's name on the election ballot. Which right did Parvati exercise? If you said the right to vote, you're correct. All right, next up. Peih-Gee posts on her social media encouraging people to vote for the Democratic candidate for governor. An admissions officer at the public university Peih-Gee got into is the brother of the Republican candidate. He rescinds Peih-Gee's offer of admission based on her support for the Democratic candidate."
Social Studies,"Which political right did the admissions officer violate in this scenario? This is a violation of Peih-Gee's right to political freedom of speech. Okay, last one. Spencer has been an avid hunter since he was a kid and is interested in joining the National Rifle Association. His boss, Charles, doesn't like guns, and doesn't want Spencer to join the NRA."
Social Studies,"If Charles tries to prohibit Spencer from joining the NRA, which of Spencer's rights would he be violating? He would be violating Spencer's right to freedom of association, which means that he can join groups without fear of reprisal. Okay, that's all for now. Which do you think is the most important political right that citizens have?."
Social Studies,"The most basic of these rights is to acquire, use, transfer and dispose off property. That is you can buy stuff, you can use it, you can give it or sell it to someone else and you can throw it away. These property rights also include your right to receive just compensation for the taking of private property for public use, which is protected by the fifth amendment. So if the government decides that they need your yard, because they're building a highway, they must compensate you fairly for that lands."
Social Studies,"The government also protects your rights to copyright and patent so that you can sue someone who steals your ideas, work or inventions. So this includes your right to own things that aren't physical objects or lands, like a song you wrote. Then there are the economic rights that safeguard your freedom to own your own labor and the money you earn from it. Those include the right to earn a wage, the right to choose your own work and change your employment and the right to work in safe conditions."
Social Studies,"Lastly, you have economic rights to associate with and combine your interests with others. Such as the right to join labor unions and professional associations to advocate for yourself and for other members of your profession. You can establish and operate a business and enter into lawful contracts with others."
Social Studies,"The ability to own one's own property, labor and business dealings is foundational to the system of capitalism, in which individuals control economic organizations rather than the state or co-operatives. So now let's do a couple of scenarios, so you can check your skills. I'll give you a scenario and you see if you can identify which economic right is being exercised or violated. Number one, Yael and a group of her coworkers are frustrated with the working conditions at the grocery store they work at."
Social Studies,"They're forced to work 10 hours days with only a 30 minute break for lunch. Several of her co-workers have started reporting knee problems because they aren't allowed to sit. Yael gathers a majority of employees to talk about organizing a union to demand less hours and more breaks. Her boss hears about the meeting and fires Yael. Which right, did her employer violate in this scenario? The right to join a labor union. Yael has the right to join unions or professional associations as she chooses."
Social Studies,"Number two, one day, a city council member knocks on Tai's door. He tells Tai that the city needs half of his backyard to expand the public park that sits on the other side of Tai's fence. Tai refuses to give the land away, but the city council member tells Tai he doesn't have a choice and that he will receive a cheque for $50 to repair the fence once they take it down tomorrow."
Social Studies,"Which right did the city council violate in this scenario? The right to just compensation for the taking of private property for public use. Tai's back yard is worth a lot more than $50. Number three, Hamza's boss calls him into his office one day and lets him know that there's a new opening in another department in the company. But Hamza doesn't want to move departments and enjoys the job he has. He requests not to change."
Social Studies,"His boss tells him that if he doesn't move to the new department, she'll have to fire him. Instead, Hamza quits. He starts looking for a new job immediately. Which right did Hamza use in this scenario? He used his right to change employment. That's all for this video. What do you think is the most important economic right? What would be the consequences if you didn't have one of these rights?."
Social Studies,"So you won't get in trouble with the law if you don't do them, but your community will be a better place if you do. We'll talk more about the obligations of citizenship in another video. So for now, let's just focus on the responsibilities. What are those responsibilities? First there's voting. It's not legally required that citizens vote in the United States, unlike in some other countries where citizens can get in trouble, if they don't vote."
Social Studies,"But responsible citizens get involved with the decision making process, through voting. And to be a good voter, It's important that citizens are informed. They stay up to date on the issues that government is facing and they research candidates and ballot measures before they vote. the voting, isn't the only way to be a responsible citizen. You can also do so by voicing your concerns."
Social Studies,"For example, something I did recently, and this is true, was emailing my city's transit department about a street light that wasn't functioning properly near where I live, the transit department came out and fixed it. And now there's less of a chance that an accident will happen in that intersection. So when you notice a problem that may affect others, it's responsible to speak up and try to fix things. You can also act as a responsible citizen by volunteering."
Social Studies,"If you have a skill to teach others or time to give for a good cause you can make your community a better place through your service. Lastly, good citizens respect the rights and beliefs of others. They understand that in a democracy, not everyone may have the same opinions or concerns as they do, but everyone else is entitled to the same rights as they are. So that's a quick rundown of the responsibilities of citizenship."
Social Studies,Which one do you think is most important? What other things can you do to improve your community?.
Social Studies,"Obligations are actions that citizens are required to fulfill, or they'll face punishment by law. Unlike the responsibilities of citizenship we talked about in the last video, which are voluntary actions taken by good citizens. The obligations of citizenship are not optional. So what are some of these obligations? First, citizens must obey the law. They're bound to abide by the rules that have been made by elected representatives in government."
Social Studies,"Next, citizens over the age of 18 are required to serve on juries. The Constitution guarantees people who've been accused of a crime the right to a trial by a jury of their peers. So citizens are obligated to show up and be those peers when summoned. Although not everyone who is summoned will be selected to serve on a jury. Citizens are also obligated to pay their taxes every year by April 15th according to state, local, and federal laws."
Social Studies,"What other obligations do citizens have? Young citizens are required to attend school, as children and teenagers. Most states require students to go to school from about the age of five or six, to about 16 to 18. Although the exact ages and requirements differ from state to state. The last two obligations are to defend the Constitution and the country when called upon. These are in the naturalization oath that new citizens must take."
Social Studies,"To defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States means to be loyal to the system of government, not to try to overthrow the government or support a particular ruler rather than the system described in the Constitution. Citizens are also obligated to defend the country in a combat or non combat capacity when called upon by the government. Although at this time, only men or people assigned male at birth, must register for selective service between the ages of 18 and 26."
Social Studies,"So now that we've learned about the obligations of citizenship, let's do a couple of examples. See if you can identify which obligation each person in the scenario is or is not meeting. Okay, first up. Michel is an avid bicyclist. He bikes to work everyday. He knows that he could save about five minutes off his commute if he cuts through a college campus and rides on the sidewalks. However, in New York City, it's illegal for bicyclists over the age of 13 to ride on sidewalks, as bikes are vehicles."
Social Studies,"So Michel sticks to the bike paths on the street. All right, so pause the video here and think about which obligation Michel is following. If you said obeying the law, you're right. Okay, next one. Naomi is 14 and starts tricking here mom into thinking she's taking the bus, but instead goes to the library to read all day. She gets away with it for three days before her mom finds out. Which obligation was Naomi neglecting? She's neglecting her obligation to attend school. Last one."
Social Studies,"To deal with the shortage of personnel in a war, the U.S. government drafts thousands of men. One of these men, John Stewart, reports for enlistment with the U.S. Marine Corps at the young age of 19. Which obligation is he meeting? This one is the obligation to defend the country when called upon. All right, that's all for now. Keep practicing in the exercise for this lesson.."
Social Studies,"Although they were citizens, white women could not vote. Indigenous people, enslaved people, and free Black people weren't permitted to be US citizens, or to vote. So let's pick up the story now in the 1840s, when the United States rapidly colonized North America. As part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the peace treaty that ended the Mexican-American war, the Mexican government ceded the territory that's now most of the Western half of the United States."
Social Studies,"The Mexican people who were already living in that territory were granted US citizenship. Although the indigenous people who were living there were not. Although the Mexican-American citizens were eligible to vote in theory, in practice they faced intimidation from white Americans that limited their access to voting. During the 1850s, debate over the institution of slavery, and the status of Black Americans, consumed the country."
Social Studies,"In the midst of this turmoil in 1857, the Supreme Court issued the Dred Scott opinion, which we'll talk about in more detail in another video, ruling that Black people were not guaranteed birthright citizenship, and had no pathway to citizenship. Asian immigrants, who started coming to the United States in larger numbers in the 1850s, were also not considered eligible for citizenship. And in the late 19th century, and early 20th century, the US government banned immigration from China and Japan altogether."
Social Studies,"In the 1860s, the tensions between slave and free states boiled over into war. The Southern states succeeded from the Union to protect slavery, starting a civil war that lasted for four years. During the Civil War, the US government issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring the end of slavery in the Southern states, and after the war, ratified the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery everywhere in the country."
Social Studies,"But ending slavery didn't automatically guarantee citizenship rights for Black people in the United States. In 1868, the ratification of the 14th Amendment established that all persons born, or naturalized, in the United States were citizens. This ensured that Black people, both men and women, had citizenship. As well as the US born children of Asian immigrants. Although, again, it was still not interpreted to mean that indigenous people had citizenship at this time."
Social Studies,"In addition, a new Naturalization Act of 1870 broadened the people who were eligible for citizenship to include aliens of African nativity, and persons of African descent. But, just like the end of slavery didn't automatically guarantee citizenship rights, citizenship didn't automatically guarantee voting rights. Nowhere in the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights, was the right to vote protected. Elections then, as now, were controlled by the states."
Social Studies,"And although the 14th Amendment stipulated that states would lose representation in Congress if they denied the vote to any male citizen of voting age, this was the first time that the word male was introduced into the Constitution, which we'll see the importance of in just a sec, it quickly became clear that a stronger Amendment was needed to ensure Black citizens could vote."
Social Studies,"So in 1870, Congress passed, and the states ratified, the 15th Amendment, which prohibited the Federal Government, and the states, from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This was intended to ensure that Black men had the right to vote, which they exercised in the South for several years, until the US government stopped enforcing the rights of Black citizens in the South, and white supremacist governments returned to power."
Social Studies,"The 15th Amendment also did not prevent the denial of voting rights on the basis of sex, which was a major blow for the women's suffrage movement. Women would not succeed in their campaign for the vote until 1920. So that's a very brief overview of the changes in citizenship and voting rights in the first 100 years after the founding of the United States. I'll leave you to reflect on a few questions."
Social Studies,"Why do you think that citizenship changed over time? What does the history of who did, and didn't, have citizenship at various points tell us about the concept of citizenship in the United States? And what's the relationship between citizenship and voting rights?."
Social Studies,"If you do wanna learn more about the Dred Scott case, we have a much more in-depth video on the subject that I'll link to in the description. Okay, so let me set the scene for you. In the mid-1800s, the U.S. government had been trying to balance the desires and the political power of the slave-owning southern states and the free northern states for decades. They kept making compromises to keep the union from falling apart. And one of these was the Missouri Compromise of 1820."
Social Studies,"The geography of this is important. So let's take a look at a map of North America at the time. So here, you can see the free states and territories of the north in green, and the slave-owning states and territories in blue. In 1820, the U.S. government agreed that to maintain the balance of power between slave and free states, as new states entered the union from western lands, new states below this 36 30' line of latitude would be slave states, and above it would be free states."
Social Studies,"Missouri was the exception, the last slave state to be admitted above that line. Now this compromise worked to stave off political disunion for 30 years. But by the 1850s, when a whole bunch of new states were set to enter the union following Mexico's cession of this land to the United States, the compromise was starting to fall apart. Now what does all this have to do with a man named Dred Scott? Dred was an enslaved man who had been born into slavery in Virginia."
Social Studies,"His enslaver eventually moved to Missouri and when Dred was about 30 years old, that man sold him to an army doctor named Emerson. Emerson took Dred to Illinois, where Dred married his wife Harriet, who was also enslaved. Emerson went back to Missouri but left Dred and Harriet in Illinois. He sold their services as labors and kept the money that they made, which was definitely illegal because he was practicing slavery in a free state."
Social Studies,"After a year or so, Emerson moved to Louisiana and married a woman named Eliza Sanford. And Emerson ordered Dred and Harriet to join them. They took a steamboat down to Louisiana and while they were on that steamboat, Harriet gave birth to a baby girl, who was lawfully free since she had been born in free territory. But the Emersons continued to enslave all three of them. Eventually, Dr."
Social Studies,"Emerson died and his wife Eliza Sanford became the sole owner of the Scott family, who had moved back to Missouri with her. In 1846, Dred tried to purchase their freedom from her, but she refused. So he filed a freedom suit in Missouri court. He pled that since he had been taken into a free state, he should have been freed, and that his family was being held unjustly. The case made its way through the courts over the course of several years."
Social Studies,"And in the meantime, Eliza transferred ownership of the Scotts to her brother, John Sanford. Since he lived in a different state, it became a federal case, and eventually it came before the Supreme Court. So in 1857, the Supreme Court led at that time by Chief Justice Roger Taney issued its ruling in Dred Scott versus Sandford. You'll notice that Sandford has an extra D in it in the title because it was entered incorrectly in the records and never changed."
Social Studies,"Taney wrote the majority opinion and he came to two main conclusions. First, that Dred Scott couldn't bring suit in the Supreme Court because he was black and the descendant of enslaved Africans. Taney said that he believed the founders of the United States had never intended for black people, enslaved or free, to have citizenship rights."
Social Studies,"He made a distinction between black people, who he believed the founders intended for perpetual servitude, and indigenous people, who he thought had been treated as members of separate nations, and therefore could immigrate to the United States if they wanted to. What does this tell you about how Taney was envisioning citizenship and who was eligible to claim it? Now generally in cases when the Supreme Court rules that it doesn't have jurisdiction to hear a case, it stops there."
Social Studies,It doesn't go on to give any opinion about the merits of the case itself. But Taney bucked that convention and went on to make a ruling about whether going over that Missouri Compromise line from a slave state to a free one made Dred Scott free. And he said that it didn't and that the whole Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional because it interfered with slave owners' property rights.
Social Studies,"Now it's worth mentioning here that the Dred Scott decision is universally regarded as the worst Supreme Court decision of all time. Not just because it was morally bankrupt, but also because it wasn't based on sound reasoning. Taney definitely cherry-picked his evidence about the founders never intending black people to be citizens. For example, he left out the fact that propertied black men could vote in five of the original 13 states at the time of the founding."
Social Studies,"And that the founders agreed to outlaw slavery in the Northwest Territory, both of which suggests that there wasn't any kind of consensus among the founders about the status of black people or the future of slavery in the west. So what was the impact of this decision? The Supreme Court thought this decision was going to settle the question about slavery and its spread to the west for good, but it ended up completely backfiring."
Social Studies,"Tensions between the north and south started to reach a fever pitch after this decision. Abraham Lincoln started to gain a national following because of his arguments against this case. And eventually, civil war would erupt when Lincoln became president. After the Civil War, two new amendments to the constitution would undue the Dred Scott decision. The 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, and the 14th Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship rights for all people born in the United States."
Social Studies,"Although Dred Scott lost his case, just two months later, he did get his freedom. He didn't get to enjoy it for long though, since he died just a year later. His wife Harriet and two daughters did survive to see the end of slavery and the 14th Amendment. And his great-great-grandchildren are alive today.."
Social Studies,"So let's zoom out a bit from the 19th Amendment and take a look at citizenship rights for women, both before and after the amendment. Back in 1868, when the 14th Amendment was passed, it guaranteed citizenship to anyone born or naturalized in the United States. White women had been considered citizens since the country's founding, but now, after the 14th Amendment, women of color born on U.S. soil were included among the ranks of citizens. But again, this didn't mean that women had the right to vote."
Social Studies,"In 1872, Virginia Minor, a resident of Missouri, attempted to register to vote and was denied. Her husband sued for them both because women couldn't bring suit in Missouri at the time. The Minors argued that the 14th Amendment guaranteed Virginia's right to vote, and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court in 1875."
Social Studies,"In Minor versus Happersett, Happersett was the name of the registrar who wouldn't let Virginia register to vote, the court issued the ruling that the right to vote was not one of the constitutionally protected rights of citizenship. This meant that, for women to get the right to vote, they would either have to get individual states to permit women to vote or persuade Congress to amend the U.S. Constitution. Women suffragists pursued both of those strategies."
Social Studies,"And, by 1919, when Congress approved the 19th Amendment, women had full suffrage in 15 States and partial suffrage, meaning that they could vote in some types of elections but not others, in 20 more states. The 19th Amendment overturned Minor versus Happersett and ensured that women had the right to vote in every state. However, there were still ways that women's citizenship was limited. For one thing, a woman's citizenship status was very much tied up with her husband's."
Social Studies,"In the early 20th century, if an American woman married a non-citizen, she lost her U S citizenship. The reverse was not true. If an American man married a non-citizen, he remained a citizen. This was a relic of the legal doctrine of coverture, that a woman's legal rights were swallowed up by her husband's when she got married. In 1922, shortly after the 19th Amendment, the Cable Act started the process of disentangling a woman's citizenship status from that of her husband."
Social Studies,"But it wasn't until 1934 that all of the exceptions and loopholes were closed. Jury service was another arena where women's citizenship rights took some time to catch up to men's. Some states tied jury service to voting so that, when women got the right to vote, they became eligible to serve as jurors. But that wasn't the case in every state. So, even after the 19th Amendment, women had to fight for the right to sit on juries in more than 30 states."
Social Studies,"We tend to think of jury duty as something to get out of, if at all possible, but it's really an incredibly important aspect of citizenship. It ensures that people who are accused of a crime are tried by a jury of their peers. Not until 1968 did every state require women to sit on juries. So how important do you think the 19th Amendment was in gaining citizenship rights for women? What did it change and what didn't it change? And why is jury service so important to citizenship?."
Social Studies,"The inhabited territories here are Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa. Then there are two here in the Caribbean, the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. You may also be surprised to learn that the capital of the United States, Washington, is in a special geographic and political zone called the District of Columbia, which is also not a state. The most populous territory by far is Puerto Rico with more than 3 million residents."
Social Studies,"Its population is greater than 19 of the US states, putting it just behind Utah but ahead of Iowa in numbers. The District of Columbia has more than 700,000 residents, putting it ahead of just two states in population. The other four territories are much smaller with between 50,000 and 200,000 residents. The citizenship status and voting rights of the people living in these territories might be different from residents of the states. Let's delve a little bit more into these differences."
Social Studies,"Most people living in the American territories are granted US citizenship at birth, although that has not always been the case. Although white people born in the District of Columbia have had citizenship at birth from the creation of the district in 1790, the large black population of the city didn't gain citizenship protections until the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868."
Social Studies,"Over the course of the 20th century, the residents of four of the other territories have gotten citizenship status by various means, starting with Puerto Rico by an act of Congress in 1917. The US Virgin Islands gained citizenship by congressional order in 1927. The 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act expanded the definition of who received US citizenship at birth to include Guam. And residents of the Northern Mariana Islands became citizens when their territory became a Commonwealth in 1976."
Social Studies,"The residents of American Samoa are currently US nationals, not US citizens. This means that they have the right to travel and live in the United States. And they're afforded protection by the United States when traveling abroad, but they don't qualify for other benefits of US citizenship, like the right to vote. But that might change soon. Right now, a case which is seeking US citizenship for American Samoans, Fitisemanu versus the United States, is making its way through the federal court system."
Social Studies,"So we may hear a ruling on this case this year. The citizens of the territories and Washington DC have many of the same citizenship rights and responsibilities as citizens of the states. Remember, because American Samoans are US nationals rather than citizens, their situation is a little bit different. So what I'm about to say does not apply to them. The citizens of the territories have the right to move freely within the United States without a passport."
Social Studies,"They also have the right to vote in presidential primaries but not in presidential elections. We'll talk more about voting rights in a sec, because DC is also a bit different in this regard. Citizens in the territories also have most of the same civil and political rights as the people in the states, and their responsibilities are also much the same. Although they don't have to pay federal income tax, they do have to pay other federal taxes like Social Security and Medicare."
Social Studies,"They also must defend the country when called upon and obey federal laws and regulations. However, even though the citizens of the territories and Washington DC have to obey federal laws, pay federal taxes and defend the country when called upon, they do not have any voting representation in Congress. Each of the territories has a delegate in the House of Representatives. But although those delegates may participate and debate and sit on committees, they may not cast votes."
Social Studies,"The citizens of Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands can vote for their territorial governor, their delegate in the House and in presidential primaries. The citizens of Washington DC can vote for their mayor and City Council, although Congress has the authority to block any laws passed by that council, if they disagree with them. DC citizens may vote in presidential elections as well."
Social Studies,"The 23rd Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified in 1961, gave the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of the president and the vice president. So what do you think about citizenship and voting rights in the territories and in the District of Columbia? How are they different from those of the citizens of the states? And how are they similar? Why do you think they're different? And do you think they should be?."
Social Studies,"So I wanna be clear that what we're covering in this video is just the most basic outline of how citizenship for indigenous people has changed over time. There is so much more to learn on this topic if you're interested. Okay with that said, let's go back to 1789 when the constitution gave the first definition of who was and was not a US citizen."
Social Studies,Article 1 of the constitution mentions indigenous people twice; once to say that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes. And once to say that the population of each state as counted for the purposes of representation would exclude Indians not taxed.
Social Studies,"That indigenous people were categorized with foreign nations for the purposes of regulating trade and not counted in state populations shows us that they were not considered US citizens at that time. Remember that at this time, US citizenship was generally reserved for white men, women and children and voting rights were reserved for white men with property."
Social Studies,"The next major change in citizenship rights was the ratification of the 14th amendment, which guaranteed citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States. This ensured citizenship rights for African-Americans and the children of Asian immigrants. But at the time the courts did not interpret it to include indigenous people."
Social Studies,"Only about 8% of all indigenous people, those who were not living among a distinct nation, but instead within white settlements were taxed and therefore eligible to become citizens. Now I should mention that not all indigenous people wanted US citizenship, many preferred to live separately from the United States as part of their own nations."
Social Studies,"But as the US government and white settlers colonized North America rapidly in the mid to late 19th century, they ignored the rights of indigenous people as members of separate nations, forcibly relocating them to reservations or even killing them in order to obtain their land."
Social Studies,"In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act, which attempted to force indigenous people to give up their culture and common lands and live like Euro-Americans on individual tracks of land, any indigenous person who received a land allotment would receive US citizenship. It didn't grant birthright citizenship to indigenous people or citizenship to anyone who didn't accept a land allotment."
Social Studies,"not until 1924 in recognition of indigenous soldiers in World War I, did Congress confer citizenship on all indigenous people and guarantee birthright citizenship to them with the passage of the Snyder Act, which is also called the Indian Citizenship Act. But did having citizenship automatically confer the right to vote? If you've been paying attention in these videos, you will know that the answer is no. Many States denied voting rights to indigenous people."
Social Studies,They faced many of the same barriers to accessing the ballot as African-Americans did before the civil rights movement. Following World War II indigenous people sued for the right to vote in States that denied them. Utah was the last state to remove formal barriers in 1962. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided additional protections for indigenous voters by outlying exclusionary practices that deny or bridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.
Social Studies,So that's a very brief overview of indigenous citizenship rights and voting rights. In what ways were the citizenship rights of indigenous peoples similar to other minorities like African-Americans and in what ways were they different? Why do you think indigenous people may have wanted US citizenship or not wanted US citizenship?.
Social Studies,"This is just an overview of what happens at each step in the process. If a noncitizen wants to start the naturalization process, the first step is for them to determine if they are eligible to become a US citizen. Then, they have to wait. If they are married to a current US citizen, they have to wait three years. If they are not, they have to wait five years. During this time, many immigrants take special classes to prepare for citizenship."
Social Studies,"After the waiting period, if they are at least 18 years old, and have been a resident of the state where they intend to file for at least three months, they may file an Application for Naturalization, an N-400. Once they've submitted their application, they must attend a biometrics appointment to have their fingerprints added to their records."
Social Studies,"Then they'll have to complete an interview with an official from US Citizenship and Immigration Services to ensure that they meet the necessary requirements, and to conduct the naturalization exam. The exam has two parts: an English language test, with questions about reading, writing, and speaking English, and a civics test, with 10 questions on basic facts about the history and government of the United States."
Social Studies,"If the applicant gets six of the 10 questions right, they pass, and their application is approved. The final step in the naturalization process is to attend a ceremony to pledge an oath of allegiance. The noncitizen swears to be loyal to the United States above all, to obey the Constitution and other laws, and to perform military or other duties if needed. Then, they sign a document, and are declared a citizen of the United States."
Social Studies,"And if they have any children under the age of 18, their children automatically become naturalized citizens too. In the next video, we'll go into more detail about the eligibility requirements for naturalization.."
Social Studies,"There are nine requirements that an immigrant must meet before they can apply for naturalization. And four of the first five all have to do with how long an applicant has lived in the United States. First, they have to be 18 years old. Does this mean that children can't become citizens? No, but they can't apply on their own. If their parent or parents apply for naturalization, a child can inherit their parent's citizenship if they make it through the process."
Social Studies,"Second, the applicant has to have been a permanent resident for at least five years, unless they're married to an American citizen then it's only three years. So this means that undocumented immigrants and foreign diplomats are not eligible for naturalization. Third, they have to show that they've lived in the US customs and immigration services district they've been living in when they applied for at least three months. There are 26 US CIS districts which also include US territories."
Social Studies,"Fourth, they have to have lived in the United States continuously for at least five years. A green card holder can leave for short periods of time, but if they've lived outside the United States for more than six months, they could compromise their eligibility for naturalization."
Social Studies,"Included in that is the fifth requirement that they have to have been physically present in the United States for at least 30 months out of the five years of residency they maintained before they file their application for naturalization. These five cover the residency requirements for naturalization, but there are four other requirements that are verified during the naturalization process itself."
Social Studies,"If you remember the steps of the naturalization process, you should remember that at one point, a person seeking naturalization needs to meet with a US CIS official for an interview. and to take the naturalization test. It's during this step that the US CIS official tests the applicant on the next two requirements, their ability to understand English and their knowledge of US history and government."
Social Studies,"The federal government requires that all naturalized citizens can read, write, speak and understand conversational English. The interview itself serves as the test for the speaking portion. And after the interview, the applicant has to read one out of three chosen sentences correctly. And for the writing test, the applicant will write an English sentence provided by the interviewer."
Social Studies,"Following the English portion, the interviewer asks 10 questions about US history and government and the applicant must answer at least six correctly. Some examples of questions that an interviewer can ask are, how many amendments does the constitution have? Or, who's in charge of the executive branch? Then there are only two requirements left, and they're the hardest to verify because they aren't entirely obvious."
Social Studies,"The eighth requirement for naturalization is that you have to be a person of good moral character. Trying to determine a person's character is hard to do. Do you think you could get a good grasp of a person's character in an interview that lasts a few hours or reading an application they filled out? The way the government determines moral character is by looking to see if an applicant has a criminal history, but that isn't exactly foolproof."
Social Studies,"They can look into American criminal databases, but they don't have access to other countries' criminal records. US CIS often has to rely on self reporting. And while it is rare for someone with a criminal history to make it through the naturalization process, it has been known to happen. The final requirement is that the applicant has to demonstrate an attachment to the principles and ideals of the US Constitution."
Social Studies,"This means that an applicant has to prove that they would actively support the constitution and support a democratic form of government. If someone is hostile to the form of government in the United States, they cannot become a citizen. One way that a person proves this is by agreeing to take an oath of allegiance in a public ceremony."
Social Studies,"In this oath, they must promise to renounce all foreign allegiance, though that does not mean they have to give up their citizenship to other countries and promise to give full allegiance to the United States, its constitution and its laws. They must also promise to perform all duties and obligations of citizenship including defending the country when called upon."
Social Studies,"So now that we've covered all of the requirements, let's go through an example to see if you can determine whether an immigrant is eligible for citizenship or not. Lorenzo has lived most of his life in Italy, but now he wants to become a US citizen. He came to the United States three years ago and has been a legal resident ever since. He has never been in trouble with the law, either in the United States or in Italy. He enjoys owning his own home and living in a friendly neighborhood."
Social Studies,"Lorenzo is 25 years old, speaks English very well and has recently taken a class at a local community college on US history for new citizens. He filled out his naturalization application form last week. So let's check off all of the requirements that Lorenzo does have. Take a second and pause this video to try and figure it out on your own first. All right, so Lorenzo is 25 years old so he meets the minimum age requirement."
Social Studies,"He's only been a permanent resident for three years and he's not married to a US citizen so he doesn't meet the residency requirement. He's lived in Portland for three years so he meets the third and fifth requirements, but he doesn't meet the fourth requirement. Lorenzo can speak English very well and took a class on US history for new immigrants so we can assume that he can pass both portions of the naturalization test."
Social Studies,"And since he's never been in any legal trouble, we'll put a check mark next to him having good moral character. We can't exactly tell if he's attached to the principles and ideals of the US Constitution so we'll put a question mark next to that requirement. All right, given all this information, do you think Lorenzo is eligible to apply for naturalization? If you answered no, you're correct."
Social Studies,"Even though Lorenzo meets a lot of the requirements, he doesn't meet all of them and eligibility is an all or nothing type deal. He has to meet all nine requirements before he can apply. In the next video, we'll cover some of the challenges of the naturalization process.."
Social Studies,"Immigrants face strict requirements to become lawful permanent residents, and when they try to become U.S. citizens, they face increased filing costs and long processing times for their applications. Certain groups of immigrants get priority when they apply for lawful permanent resident status. As the Pew Research Center reported, in 2015, 44% of green cards went to immigrants who were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens."
Social Studies,"And 20% went to immigrants who were extended family members of citizens and lawful permanent residents. Having special skills, like being a talented doctor or doing innovative research, or special talents, like being a gifted athlete, means you're in the most prioritized group for employment-based preferences for lawful permanent residents."
Social Studies,"If you don't have special skills or talents, you can still be eligible for employment-based residency, but you have to have an employer willing to complete all the necessary paperwork with the federal government. As that is an added cost, some employers refuse to hire people from outside the United States."
Social Studies,"So if you don't have any specialized skills, a job offer, an employer willing to file paperwork for labor certification, a parent with lawful permanent resident or citizenship status, it's difficult to get lawful permanent status. The challenges continue throughout the naturalization process. It takes years for lawful permanent residents to become American citizens. Remember that even to apply for naturalization, lawful permanent residents have to have lived in the United States for at least five years."
Social Studies,But the process can take much longer than that. The median time it takes for lawful permanent residents to become citizens is actually eight years. Part of the reason that it takes so long is because of how long it takes to process a naturalization application. The federal government has experienced a significant backlog of applications waiting for processing. And the average time to process a citizenship application has doubled since 2012.
Social Studies,"This is due to a surge in applications and stricter scrutiny on those applications. And the costs associated with filing a naturalization application have also increased significantly. Let's take a look at this chart. In 1985, it only cost $35 for a person to file an application. Now it costs over $1,000 to file. Why does it cost so much more? USCIS argues that the increased fees are necessary to offset the growing cost of processing applications and deterring fraud."
Social Studies,"And this graph doesn't cover all of the costs an immigrant might incur during the naturalization process, since it doesn't include any of the costs associated with getting a lawyer to advise them or any classes that they might need to take in order to learn English or U.S. Civics. Although immigrant residents face a number of challenges to become naturalized citizens, hundreds of thousands apply for naturalization every year, because the benefits of becoming a naturalized citizen often outweigh the costs.."
Social Studies,"But you might belong to several different communities at once, your city or town, yes. But also your school or a club sport or online gaming or social media networks or an identity group. Anytime you join together with others with a common interest, you're in a community. And when you work to promote the quality of life in a community, that's civic engagement. Civic engagement also doesn't only mean engaging with politics and government. That's one way of acting to affect change in a community."
Social Studies,"And remember that we define politics as a process by which people reach collective decisions despite potentially diverging opinions that are generally regarded as binding on the group and enforced as common policy. But civic engagement also includes a whole spectrum of ways that people participate in self-governance including interacting with government, volunteering in and serving their communities, and organizing for social, political, and economic causes."
Social Studies,"When someone works to make a difference in their community and develops the combination of knowledge, skills, values, and motivation in order to make a difference, they're practicing civic engagement. So what does civic engagement look like? It could be many things. Here are a few examples. Organizing a voter registration drive, hosting a town meeting, or organizing a protest."
Social Studies,"It could also be raising awareness about community issues through a blog or website, helping others get the skills or resources that they need to succeed, or seeing a need in your community and filling it. I was on a hike last weekend and saw a ranger station that was built by an Eagle Scout. That's a perfect example of civic engagement, Helping elementary school students build reading skills so that they can become strong citizens is a good example."
Social Studies,So is volunteering to help rebuild after a hurricane or making sure that a homeowner who's in a wheelchair has a ramp to get in and out of her house. So that's a very brief overview of civic engagement. Can you think of any other examples? What does a person do differently when they're practicing civic engagement versus when they're not? What forms of civic engagement do you see in the communities you belong to?.
Social Studies,"So which one is right? Okay, yeah, you guessed it. It's a trick question. In fact, these are all models of good citizenship, and I wanna to dive a little more deeply into each of them to give you a sense of what they mean, because if you compare what you jotted down when I asked you to imagine a good citizen, to what your friend or your parent or your teacher imagined, you might find that they had something entirely different in mind."
Social Studies,"So it's helpful to be able to name different visions for good citizenship, so that you can probe a little more deeply into what someone really means when they're talking about it. The first model you might see is that of the personally-responsible citizen. This is a model of citizenship that focuses on the actions an individual can take to be a good member of their community. A personally-responsible citizen fulfills their personal obligations and acts responsibly."
Social Studies,"They pay their taxes, vote, obey the law, and volunteer to help the less fortunate. The are honest and work hard. What separates this model from the other two we're going to talk about is that the personally-responsible citizen generally doesn't try to change society or lead efforts to improve their community. They just do their part. The second model I wanna talk about is participatory citizenship. This model emphasizes community action and organizing."
Social Studies,"The participatory citizen might create a group to advocate for environmental protection, or organize a blood drive at their school or workplace. They believe in working collectively with others to address problems in their communities. They tend to work through established systems and groups to enact change, which distinguishes them from the last model I wanna talk about, the justice-oriented citizen."
Social Studies,"A big difference between the justice-oriented citizen and the participatory citizen is that participatory citizens don't attempt to change big underlying social problems like poverty or racism. They organize to meet the challenges of the world as it is. So let's talk a little bit more about this third model, the justice-oriented citizen. The justice-oriented citizen is interested in addressing social issues and the larger structures that lead to injustice."
Social Studies,"They try to take a step back from society as it is to ask why problems happen, and seek solutions to their root causes. So for a justice-oriented citizen, giving to charity or organizing a group to combat a social problem isn't enough. They wanna stop that problem from happening in the future. Now, I'm not telling you this because I want to convince you that there's a correct or a best way to be a good citizen."
Social Studies,"All three of these models are doing good in their communities, just in different ways and with different areas of focus. I'm also not saying that you have to choose one of these models to follow."
Social Studies,"There's nothing stopping you from doing a little bit of all three, or taking one approach with an issue you care about, and a different approach with another issue, but understanding these different approaches to citizenship will help you communicate more clearly with others about how you can work together to improve your community. Before we go, let's do a quick scenario so you can get in some practice."
Social Studies,"I'll give you some examples of students responding to a problem at their school, And you see if you can identify which model of citizenship each student represents. So here's the problem. The marching band doesn't have enough money to attend the ""The Battle of the Big Bands,"" where they're going to compete for best regional marching band. Gabe, who plays the tuba, decides to organize a bake sale in order to raise money for the band trip."
Social Studies,"Bodie, who plays the flute, bakes brownies and buys rice crispy treats for all of her friends to support the cause. Nadia, who plays alto sax wonders why the marching band doesn't have as much funding as some other school clubs. She presents in front of the school board requesting equal funding per student for extra curricular activities. Which model of citizenship does each of these students represent. Gabe is modeling participatory citizenship. He is organizing a community response to a problem."
Social Studies,"Bodie is modeling personally-responsible citizenship. She does her part in the bake sale. Nadia is modeling justice-oriented citizenship. She wants to make sure that the systems are in place to keep problems like this from happening in the first place. So which model of citizenship do you think you most often practice? Does your family, school, social group, promote one of these models more than another? Do you think there are other models of citizenship that we haven't identified here?."
Social Studies,"This involves serving in institutions that benefit the United States or other countries, but are not part of the military."
Social Studies,"Some examples include AmeriCorps programs, which send volunteers to help with rebuilding parks, tutoring kids, or alleviating hunger and poverty, among other things, Teach for America, which sends outstanding college graduates to serve as teachers in low income schools, Youth Build, which teaches construction skills to unemployed young people and helps them earn their high school diploma if they haven't already, and there's the Peace Corps, which sends Americans to promote social and economic development abroad."
Social Studies,"Service in the United States is voluntary. Today, the U.S. Armed Forces are composed entirely of people who volunteered to serve rather than people who were drafted. That wasn't always the case. From 1940 to 1973, the United States had a compulsory military draft to fill vacancies in the Armed Services that couldn't be filled by volunteer means."
Social Studies,"After the Vietnam War, compulsory military service was suspended, but men and people assigned male at birth are still required to register for selective service from ages 18 to 25 as a standby in the event that a draft is re-instituted. Other countries do have national service requirements. Israel mandates that all citizens over the age of 18 serve in the military for two years."
Social Studies,"In South Korea, men between the ages of 16 and 38 are required to serve in the military for at least 18 months, and effective in 2021, French citizens between 16 and 25 will have to participate in a month of universal national service: living in barracks, wearing uniforms, and learning about French culture, civics and volunteering, and they won't be allowed to bring their cell phones with them."
Social Studies,"Some American politicians have proposed creating a national public service program in the United States with one or two years of mandated national service for Americans between the ages of 18 and 25. They've argued that it would help diffuse partisanship by bringing people with ideologies together for a common purpose, and that it would save the government money by making use of volunteers for some labor."
Social Studies,"Opponents of the idea have argued that mandating service would be a violation of individual liberty, and that it's unnecessary to force people to do it, because so many people already volunteer. So what do you think? Should there be a mandatory national service in the United States?."
Social Studies,"And what I'm gonna do is talk about a few core beliefs that are often associated with the United States, but taken with a grain of salt. It's obviously a very large and a very diverse country where people have many, many, many beliefs. Now one thing that often gets associated with the United States is this idea of self-reliance. Self-reliance. Or sometimes would be called individualism, or these are related ideas, individualism."
Social Studies,"And this is the idea that, hey look, an individual, if people don't get in their way, can take care of themselves, that the goals of that individual should sometimes or often trump those of the collective, or say the government. And so you can imagine, someone who has a strong core belief in self-reliance or individualism, they would want a limited government. They would say hey government, just get out of my way and I can take care of myself."
Social Studies,"Now, a related idea to that, but this would be going into the corporate realm or the entrepreneurial realm, is the idea of free enterprise. Free enterprise. And this is the idea that, hey, we can generate wealth, we can create things, we can innovate, once again, if enterprise, if entrepreneurial activity, is left to its own devices. Now, once again, this core belief in free enterprise would probably favor a limited government. Hey government, just get outta my way."
Social Studies,"The more that you get involved, that just slows things down. That just is a wet blanket on the creativity and on the wealth creation that we could do, left to our own devices. Now, another idea is that of equality of opportunity, often associated with the United Sates, equality of opportunity. And this goes to the roots of the United States where we don't have a formal nobility, obviously, we don't have things like kings."
Social Studies,"That the country started off, obviously there's some major exceptions around things like slavery, but the country took pride in ideas of equality of oppurtunity. And to some degree, they feed into these first two bullet points, that if there truly is equality of oppurtunity, it kind of backs up the idea that, hey, let's just let people take care of themselves."
Social Studies,"Now on the other hand, someone who really cares about equality of opportunity might say, well, hold on a second, not everyone is born into the same circumstance. And because of that, if you truly care about equality of oppurtunity, there might be a role for the government to play in helping to level that playing field a bit. So these folks might not want as limited of a government as some of the folks who are strongly in the camp of self-reliance or individualism."
Social Studies,"Now the fourth core belief I'll talk about and that is the rule of law. Rule of law. Now, any country, in order to function, needs a rule of law. But one thing that the United States takes pride in itself, and I think the United States citizens take pride in itself, is that, hey look, if there's going to be a contract between individuals, people will uphold that contract, that because of a solid rule of law, it's less likely that people will get away with crimes."
Social Studies,"And there are examples that you could look around the world where people might have less faith in the rule of law. (mumbles) people are getting away with stuff or if I get into an agreement with someone, there's no way that I can really enforce that agreement. And so the rule of law, this would argue for some role of government, but it depends how focused or how limited of a rule of law people's core beliefs are."
Social Studies,"And to make these core beliefs and their impact on government a little bit more tangible, I have some quotes from some notable Americans. Now several of these are Presidents, but their views are really indicative of broader views in the American population. So, this first one comes from President Ronald Reagan and he said, Government's first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives."
Social Studies,"So which core beliefs do you think Ronald Reagan is representing here? Well, when I look at this, it seems like he doesn't want the government to really mess with people's lives, he's really talking about self-reliance, individualism, free enterprise. And he is making some reference, that look, there is a duty to protect the people."
Social Studies,"So he's saying you do need the government to enforce the rule of law, but he seems to favor a limited government and he, indeed, did favor a limited government that does not get in the way of, say, free enterprise or people's ability to be self-reliant."
Social Studies,"Now, some would argue on the other end of the spectrum, here is a quote from Franklin Roosevelt, in which he said, Not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our government to give employment to idle men. So, FDR here, is talking about a very active government, not the type of limited government that Ronald Reagan seems to allude to."
Social Studies,"Here, he's saying that it's the job of the government, and remember the context here is FDR was President during the Great Depression and the beginning of World War II, and during the Great Depression you had massive unemployment, and he's saying look, not only the future of our economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of the government to give employment to these men."
Social Studies,"Now, his argument might have been look, if we don't give employment, then you could have a revolution on your hands, then people are gonna lose faith in this idea of the United States, they're gonna lose faith in the government."
Social Studies,"Now, on the other hand, some people might say the whole reason why we were in that mess is that the government was intervening too much and the more that the government intervenes, it actually might not allow free enterprise to naturally solve the economic situation that we were in at the time. But, once again, Franklin Roosevelt seemed to be a little bit less on self-reliance cause he said, look, these people aren't gonna find jobs on their own, the government needs to get them jobs."
Social Studies,"Now here's another viewpoint. This is from President Barack Obama. And here, President Obama says, The internet didn't get invented in its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet. The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. So this is an interesting argument."
Social Studies,"When he's saying this, he's clearly making reference to these ideas of individualism and free enterprise that are strong core beliefs in the United States. This individualism is, we succeed because of our individual initiative and free enterprise. These companies that are making money off the Internet, but his point is that these things didn't happen on their own, that, at least in this case, the Internet was started as a government project."
Social Studies,"You had DARPANET and ARPANET, which eventually evolved into the Internet so that free enterprise could take over and, frankly, allow you to watch this video. He's saying that the government actually does have a role here and because of that role that the government has played, it has actually allowed things like self-reliance, individualism, and free enterprise to flourish even more. And last but not least, I'll give you a quote from famous conservative economist, Milton Friedman."
Social Studies,"He used to be a professor at the University of Chicago and he said, Government has three primary functions. It should provide for military defense of the nation. It should enforce contracts between individuals. It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. And so Milton Friedman, here, is clearly advocating for a limited government. In terms of his core beliefs, clearly from this statement, he says, look, a rule of law is necessary."
Social Studies,"You have to have your contracts between citizens, you need to protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. If you read more Milton Friedman quotes and I encourage you to, regardless of where you are on the philosophical spectrum, they're all quite interesting. He has a strong underlying core belief in self-reliance, individualism, and free enterprise. But I'll leave you there. Think about it on your own."
Social Studies,"How does the core belief of a United States citizen, including yourself, how does that impact your view of the role of government?."
Social Studies,"If your friends go one direction or another, that could be a very powerful influence. Obviously, what you're exposed to in the media and out of all of these, the one that's maybe the most studied is the notion of family and to appreciate this idea, let's look at this diagram right over here. So I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can make sense of this before we do that together. Alright, it says Percentage Intergenerational Resemblance in Partisan Orientation and this date is from 1992."
Social Studies,"So it shows three different scenarios, one scenario where we are looking at folks where both parents are Democrats, another scenario where we're looking at folks where both parents are Republicans and then another scenario where there's no consistent partisanship among parents so either they are split or maybe they are independent and actually, if we look at this third scenario first, you see that it's a pretty symmetrical distribution."
Social Studies,"Green shows, of people whose parents showed no partisan preference, 17% are pure independent, about 18% lean towards the Democrats, 16% lean to the Republican. That's about the same. 14% are weak Democrats. 14% are weak Republicans. 10% are strong Democrats. 10% are strong Republicans. So it's a pretty balanced distribution here but then if you look at the scenario where both parents are Democrats, you see that of those folks, only, what is this? This is eight plus six is 14 plus seven."
Social Studies,"Only 21% are Republicans. And if you go the other way where both parents are Republicans, you have only 18% of those folks become Democrats. So this is just interesting food for thought."
Social Studies,"A lot of us really like to believe, including myself, that hey, I've come to all of these conclusions based on completely impartial thoughts about how the world should be but we are influenced by our environment and especially from our family and frankly, even the folks who go in a different direction than their families, that might have been because of their family."
Social Studies,"Maybe they decide that hey, that always frustrated me one way or the other so I'm gonna go the other way or I'm gonna rebel a little bit and I'm gonna go the other way because I am a free thinker but even in that situation, you are being influenced by your environment.."
Social Studies,"An example of that might be if you were to grow up or if you were an adult during the Great Depression in the 1930s, well that might affect you in many, many different ways. You would start to maybe be a little bit conservative with your own personal finances realizing that a rainy day might come one day. Many people who grew up during the Great Depression viewed FDR, Franklin Roosevelt, as a major factor in taking the country out of the Great Depression. Other folks might disagree with that position."
Social Studies,"But if you were one of those folks who believed that FDR through the expansion of government helped bring the country out of the Great Depression, and if you believe that FDR was a good leader for the United States during World War Two, well then, you might lean Democrat. You might lean Democrat the rest of your life. And it indeed seems to be the case that many people who grew during the Great Depression did indeed lean Democrat because of their belief that FDR was good for the country."
Social Studies,"Similarly, if you grew up during the Cold War or if you were an adult during the Cold War you had this thing hanging over you in the 60s, 70s, and 80s of what would a nuclear war with the Soviet Union look like? And so many of those folks might look at someone like a Ronald Reagan, who many people would argue helped bring about the end of the Cold War. And so many of these folks who did view Ronald Reagan as a major actor there might lean Republican."
Social Studies,"Or even if they don't lean Republican they might say, hey, the type of strong muscular military presence with diplomacy that Ronald Reagan did well, that's a type of point of view that I support. Now these two things were big, macro events that would have happened over many, many years, if not decades. But there could also be particular events and sometimes particular political events that might influence someone's political ideology. So let me write this down, political events."
Social Studies,"And so an example of that might be the Watergate Scandal under Richard Nixon. Many of the people who were adults then and understood what was going on, it might have led to a general distrust in government. It might have led to a more of a belief that people in high office do things without telling us. Once again, these are not, it's not gonna be everyone who lived in that time period, but it might make some folks lean one direction or another."
Social Studies,"Now everything I've talked about has been in the realm of politics, but there is also a lot that happens in culture that could affect your ideology. If you see more of a certain point of view on television for example or in movies, that might make you more sympathetic to that point of view. You also have effects over the course of your life that affect your ideology. And so these are often known as lifecycle effects. Lifecycle effects."
Social Studies,"And this is the idea that as you go from being young to getting older, just different things in your life might make you lean in one direction or another. And these are going to be broad generalizations but let's say you are young, you are in college, you have a lot of student debt, you might lean maybe toward a more progressive candidate or have liberal leanings if a candidate says hey, the government's going to try to reduce student debt or provide more support for young students."
Social Studies,"But then as you get older and maybe you become a homeowner maybe you have more wealth, you have a higher income, you might say, hey, these taxes really hurt more than I suspected and they're quite large, or maybe you're starting a business or you're saying, hey, these regulations really aren't as good as an idea as I thought they were when I was young, well then maybe you might, and I'd stress might, you might start leaning more conservative. So I'll leave you there."
Social Studies,"The big picture is is that your political ideology isn't just driven by your genetics or your family and we've talked about these in other videos, or where you grew up. So not just driven by geography, it's driven by a whole set of things, many of the things that might happen to you individually, let's say you had a bad incident with crime that might make you tougher on crime."
Social Studies,"Or maybe you were on the other side, you got arrested for something you didn't do, that might change your point of view, and things that happen on a bigger scale, things that might happen to your entire generation.."
Social Studies,"This does not mean that every Democrat will have a stereotypically Liberal view on every major issue, or that every Republican would have a stereotypically Conservative view on every issue. We're all individuals, and many of us will have different opinions on these issues, and might lean Conservative on some, and might lean Liberal on others. But just to get a sense of what Liberal and Conservative tend to mean in the United States, on issues that you will hear about, let's go through this list of issues."
Social Studies,"And I encourage you to pause this video, and have your own go at what do you think would be the Liberal or the Conservative viewpoint on each of these issues. So let's start with arguably one of the most contentious issues in the United States, and that's of abortion. A Liberal would view this as a reproductive rights issue. They view this as the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body."
Social Studies,"So they tend to be pro the right of a woman to have an abortion, to choose to have an abortion, and will self-label themselves pro-choice. Conservatives on the other hand, will often view this as a life issue, that they view the developing fetus as a life, and like any life, has certain rights. And so they would typically be against abortion, and would self-label themselves pro-life. Affirmative action is another contentious issue."
Social Studies,"This is the idea, and we've talked about it in other videos, that proactive measures should be taken in order to address wrongs of the past, or in order to address inequality today, or discrimination today. And it often takes form in, can race be considered as a part of admissions into, say, higher education? Liberals tend to be in favor of affirmative action, while Conservatives tend to be against it."
Social Studies,"The Liberal point of view is yes, we have a very unequal society, there's a lot of discrimination, race should be considered a factor in order to ease that discrimination. A Conservative today might argue, wait a second, we wanna be a racially blind society, and so we do not want race to be a factor. Guns is another very contentious issue. Liberals will often cite guns as a major factor in a lot of the crime and shootings in the United States, and they would tend to be pro gun control."
Social Studies,"Conservatives on the other hand, will often cite the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, and they would say, look, when we see mass shootings or crime, it's not a gun issue, there's other issues at play. And so they would be more pro gun rights. They would generally be against gun control, and want more rights for gun owners. On a related note, on crime, Liberals tend to view it as a social issue."
Social Studies,"What are the underlying causes, say, poverty or something else that is causing crime? They would also be very concerned with defendants' rights, citing examples where certain ethnic groups, certain races might be disproportionately accused, or disproportionately punished."
Social Studies,"Conservatives on the other hand, tend to favor tougher policing and tougher laws, saying that okay, it's interesting to look at the social issues, and yes we do need certain rights, but at the end of the day, you don't wanna be too easy on crime. So tougher policing, and tougher laws. Moving into the economic sphere, the Liberal view on taxes is generally that it's okay, and some Liberals will even view it as a tool for building social equality."
Social Studies,"They would say hey look, if someone's gotta pay for something, maybe it should be the rich. They can afford to pay more, and it'll help level the playing field a little bit. And so okay, especially on, and I'll put the rich in quotes, because different people would have different standards for what it means to be rich. And Conservatives generally are not okay with taxes. They would say that it is a disincentive to work. They would say that it's a friction on the economy."
Social Studies,"They would say that it would reduce investment that could create jobs. The Liberal and Conservative views on spending is related to that on taxes. A stereotypical view of Liberals is that, hey they might like to tax, especially on the rich, and then spend it, especially on social programs. Okay, especially on social programs. Maybe welfare system, or free healthcare, these would all be things that a Liberal point of view would more likely to support."
Social Studies,"A Conservative viewpoint is not okay with government spending, that the government should be as small as possible, and spend as little as possible. Perhaps the only exception, or one of the few exceptions, would be except on military spending. Except on military, where a Conservative might be in favor of more spending there in order to have a strong and muscular military. Now related to this idea on the size of government, is that of regulation."
Social Studies,"Liberals tend to be in favor of regulation, especially if they're in regards to things like preserving the environment. Conservatives tend to be against regulation, saying that okay, maybe some baseline regulation is okay, but it needs to be minimal, because the more regulations you have, once again, these are frictions on the economy. It makes it harder to start a business, it makes it harder to grow, it makes it more expensive to do things. So they tend to be against regulation."
Social Studies,"Last but not least, and this is just a survey of some of the big issues you will hear about in the United States, is the military. And I already touched on it. A Liberal is likely to want a military, but they would probably want something that does just the base services of what you would expect from a military. If people are invading our borders, that the military is there to protect us. So maybe we could call it basic military. While a Conservative would say, hey, you can't get complacent."
Social Studies,"Even if we're in a time of peace, even if people haven't crossed our borders in a long time, you don't know what's around the corner. Look at history, there's all sorts of complacent societies that eventually get overrun. And so they would want a strong and muscular military. And they'll make the argument that the stronger your military is, perhaps maybe the less likely that you would have to use it, because people would not even want to mess with you."
Social Studies,"They wouldn't even wanna think about messing with you if you have a strong and muscular posture. So I'll leave you there on these general ideas, and once again, these are stereotypical views. You will meet many people, including yourself, you might have a mix of these views."
Social Studies,"For example, it would not be too difficult to find a Democrat who for example might be pro-choice, but against affirmative action, who is pro gun control, who is maybe someplace in the middle here on crime, who is economically Conservative, who's not okay with taxes, who wants them to be as little as possible, who is not okay with government spending, who's maybe middle of the road on regulation, and maybe they like a strong muscular military."
Social Studies,"And likewise, you could find Republicans who similarly have a mix of viewpoints.."
Social Studies,"Then you also have monetary policy, and these are ideas around interest rates and the money supply in service of keeping the economy strong without having inflation run amok, and this is controlled in the United States by the US Federal Reserve System."
Social Studies,"Now if you were to put the various ideologies on a spectrum, it might look something like this, and I put liberal ideology on the left because it's often associated with a left leaning ideology, and I put conservatives and on the right because it's often described as a right leaning ideology."
Social Studies,"Libertarians are interesting because, if we're talking about economics, they have a lot more in common with conservatives than they do with liberals, but if we were talking about social issues, it would be the other way around. Libertarians would have a lot more in common with liberals than conservatives on social issues. In general, Libertarians want less government intervention on either dimension, on economics or social issues, but now let's focus on the entire spectrum."
Social Studies,"So if we were to think about liberals, what's your sense of how a liberal might think about, say, fiscal policy, taxation, and government spending? General speaking, liberals favor a larger government, and this larger government happens through higher taxes, higher taxes, and higher government spending and more government programs."
Social Studies,"Higher spending, and the reason why they tend to favor a larger government is they will invoke ideas of a safety net that in a wealthy society everyone should be provided for on some level. They might invoke ideas of fairness. They also believe that a larger government is out there to protect the citizenry from being taken advantage of, and so they'll also favor more regulation. Now conservatives would take the opposite stance."
Social Studies,"They tend to favor smaller government, smaller government, and it would be in the form of lower taxes, lower taxes, lower spending, lower spending, and less government regulation, less regulation, and they'll make the argument that the less that the government gets in the way the more that the economy can actually thrive."
Social Studies,"The more that business can do well, the more competitive our country will be, in which case everyone will be better off, and so they're often associated as being pro-business, but many conservatives would argue that by being pro-business it's actually helping more individuals. Now an idea that often gets associated with liberals is one of Keynesian economics. Now John Maynard Keynes was an early 20th-century economist who argued that a government could use fiscal policy in order to stimulate the economy."
Social Studies,"So Keynes argued that during recessions the government could even run deficits in order to stimulate the economy, that even deficits were not bad, by lowering taxes, because lower taxes would put more money in individuals' and business' pockets, and increasing spending. So higher government spending. Higher government spending."
Social Studies,"Now although Keynes is most associated with a liberal ideology, especially because it was practiced during the depression by FDR, some would argue that it might have come out of the depression, it turns out that most mainstream liberals and conservatives do practice some form of Keynesian economics. Liberals tend to stress the higher government spending."
Social Studies,"If we're in a recession, the government should spend more to stimulate the economy to put more money in folks' pockets so that there's more consumer spending, which could drive the economy. Conservatives try to favor the lower taxes. You will see conservative government officials say, ""Hey, we want to lower taxes to stimulate the economy."" Fundamentally, that is a Keynesian point of view. They're focusing on the lower taxes angle of it."
Social Studies,"In either case, if you're spending is higher than your taxes, both sides would run a deficit in order to stimulate the economy. Sometimes the conservatives are associated with the idea of supply-side economics, and this is the idea, this goes back to being pro-business and even lower taxes, that, hey, if more people have more money in their pockets, especially those who invest or those who are starting businesses or businesses themselves, that they can then expand their capacity."
Social Studies,"They could go and hire more people and that this would be good for everyone. Now what about libertarians? Well, on economic policy, you could view them as even more conservative than conservatives. They would favor the smallest possible government. Smallest smallest possible possible government."
Social Studies,"Many libertarians would argue that the government should only be there to protect property rights, to have a common self-defense, to have some basic public safety, and outside of that, the government should get out of the way, and people would be best off, and many libertarians would even argue that the whole idea of a Federal Reserve System that's actively controlling monetary policy is a bad idea. So I'll leave you there."
Social Studies,This gives you a big picture of how political ideology connects to folks' views on economics..
Social Studies,And I've pre-grouped these statements into categories.
Social Studies,"They could be views on social issues or economic issues and within each of those dimensions, they could be views that might want more social or economic control or ones that want less social or economic control, and this isn't a perfect full sampling of all of the major issues that folks will talk about and some of these things kind of border on social and economic, or some of them could be viewed as more control depending on how you view it or less control, but this is a first take on things."
Social Studies,"So let's just go from the top left to the bottom right, and I encourage you to keep pausing this video and coming to your own conclusion. So this first statement, affirmative action is a good thing. Would you expect that to come from someone with a liberal, conservative, or libertarian ideology? Well, this would typically come from someone with a liberal ideology."
Social Studies,"Much of the ideas and policies that liberals would favor might be around curing social injustice, so they might say, hey, we don't have the proper diversity in certain walks of life right now, we don't have a level playing field, so we need to make sure that people are properly represented, and so that would be something that you would hear from liberals, and it would be something that in general involves more control."
Social Studies,"A libertarian or a conservative would say, hey, we shouldn't try to do social engineering here, we should maybe make sure people have equal opportunities, but that doesn't mean that you have to have equal representation and outcome. This next statement, marriage should be between a man and woman. Pause this video. Who is likely to say that? Well, that would typically come from someone with a conservative ideology."
Social Studies,"This would be around a theme that many folks with conservative ideologies would point to values that are worth preserving in a society, that should not change, and so that would typically come from them, while a liberal or libertarian is more likely to say, hey, what goes on between two people, well, that's their decision and really the government should have no say on what they do. We need tougher penalties and policing to deal with crime."
Social Studies,"Well, once again, that would be something that you would likely hear from someone with a conservative ideology. A liberal or libertarian would be on the opposite side. They would say, hey, I'm afraid of too strict penalties, too strict policing, I'm afraid that the government is putting too many people in jail. So now let's go to fewer social controls. So marijuana should be legalized. Pause this video. Who is more likely to say that? Well, many liberals would be likely to say that, and also libertarians."
Social Studies,"They would say, hey, once again, what someone does within their own privacy, why should the government have a say, while many conservatives, and this goes back to values and kind of social fiber, might say, well no, some of these drugs, they break down people's value system. Maybe they lead to crime and so a conservative would be more likely to be against legalizing something like marijuana. The next statement. Laws restricting gun rights are unconstitutional and won't have the intended impact."
Social Studies,Pause this video.
Social Studies,"Who would say that? Well, you would often hear a statement like this from someone with a conservative ideology, but also from someone with a libertarian ideology, so libertarian ideology would also say something like that, and they would both cite that people have a right to protect themselves, they might cite, hey, people have a right to use guns for things like hunting, and especially libertarians might make the argument that people need to be armed in order to protect themselves from an overly strong government, from an overly strong police state."
Social Studies,"So the next statement. Same-sex couples should have full marriage rights. Who's most likely to say that? Well, this is kind of the opposite statement of this one we saw up here, and for the reasons we mentioned, this is more likely to come from someone with a liberal ideology or a libertarian, libertarian ideology. And for them, it would be about personal liberty and equal rights."
Social Studies,"And so you might already see some trends that the conservative and liberals are kind of mixed on the social when it comes to more control or less control, and don't read too much into how many there are of these. This is just, you could view as a random sampling of some issues. If I sampled more, you might have more liberal boxes up here or more conservative boxes down here, but it seems like a mix. But one clear thing that comes out is that libertarians on the social dimension are for less control."
Social Studies,"But what about the economic dimension? So this first statement, everyone has a right to quality healthcare. Who's more likely to say that? Well, that would be a liberal. Liberals, once again, they think a lot about injustice and inequality and they want the government to be proactive about it. And so they would say, hey, the government should somehow supply universal healthcare to folks."
Social Studies,"Conservatives or libertarians, not that they don't care about injustice or inequality, but they would argue that, hey, when the government kind of intervenes in things, they don't, they have all sorts of unintended consequences and oftentimes do more harm than good. The next statement. Rent control is a good thing."
Social Studies,"Well, once again, this is likely to come from a liberal, probably motivated from the idea that if rents or living costs are getting too high, that this is a way to avoid people being displaced or being priced out of their neighborhood. Now, conservatives and libertarians would argue that rent control distorts the market, it actually makes the properties that aren't on rent control overly expensive, and so it's probably doing more harm than good. The next statement. Social safety nets are crucial."
Social Studies,"Once again, this is likely to come from someone with a liberal ideology. They believe that someone, that the government has a role in making sure that everyone has a basic standard of living, so programs like food stamps or welfare. Every worker has the right to a living wage. And living wage is sometimes, you'll hear this in the context of minimum-wage discussions. Who would say that? Well, once again, you're likely to hear this from someone with a liberal ideology."
Social Studies,"They believe that higher minimum wages are a good thing, while conservatives or libertarians would argue that, no, that distorts the market and actually you might increase unemployment and you might hurt the very people that you're trying to help with some of these efforts around minimum ages. And what about here when we go to less control on the economy? Government intervention in the free market will slow the economy, hurting everyone."
Social Studies,"Well, as you could imagine, this is kind of the opposite statement as these here, because these once at the top are all the government intervening in a free economy in some way, and so this statement is more likely to come from a conservative, some of the conservative ideology or a libertarian. And so when you look in the economic dimension, the distinction between conservative and liberal, at least when it comes to more control and less control, become more clear."
Social Studies,"On economics, liberals tend to favor more control, more government intervention with a focus of trying to address social or economic inequality or environmental concerns, while conservatives and libertarians will often say, well, that's gonna do more harm than good, the government does have some functions but it should really be as small as possible and free markets are what's, in the end of the day, going to make people better off."
Social Studies,"So I will leave you there, this is a very simple model, but it helps us start to think about these issues, and so when you think about issues and you read about it in the newspaper, try to think about it in this type of a framework.."
Social Studies,"The first major expansion of voting rights happened in 1870 when the 15th Amendment was ratified. And the 15th Amendment extended suffrage, the right to vote, to African American men and men in particular, at the time women were also hoping to get the right to vote but there really was only the political will to grand suffrage to African American men. Now, this happened immediately after the Civil War, which ended in 1865, and before the Civil War really only white men had the right to vote."
Social Studies,"Now, the Civil War ended slavery but it didn't clear up the question of what the legal citizenship status of formerly enslaved men and women would be and a lot of states in the south passed laws after the Civil War specifically denying the right to vote to African American men. So, in 1870, Congress kind of fought back against this and then they passed the 15th Amendment which was then ratified by the states."
Social Studies,"The next notable expansion of voting rights didn't concern so much who got to vote as who people got to vote for. In 1913 the states ratified the 17th Amendment which provided for the popular election of senators. So, before 1913, senators were actually appointed by state legislatures instead of directly elected by citizens like members of the House of Representatives. And switching to popular election of senators is important because it gives citizens more say over the national government."
Social Studies,"So, more say over who goes into Congress and therefore more say over what kinds of laws that Congress passes. And in 1920, women finally got the right to vote in the 19th Amendment, which doubled the voting eligible population. Now let's talk about some more recent voting rights amendments and laws. In 1964 and 1965 there were two amendments and pieces of federal legislation that had a major impact on African American voting rights."
Social Studies,"Now, although African American men technically got the right to vote in 1870, African American women technically got the right to vote in 1920, there were a number of measures of voter suppression enacted in southern states that effectively prevented them from voting. One of these was the use of poll taxes which is effectively paying money for the right to vote."
Social Studies,"The 24th Amendment outlawed that and then the Voting Rights Act took that a step further by adding a number of other bans on voter suppression tactics in southern states. So, in addition to poll taxes, the Voting Rights Act banned literacy tests and forms of voter suppression like grandfather clauses which were laws that said you could only vote if your grandfather had voted."
Social Studies,"And while you might think, oh, literacy tests don't sound that bad, seems like a good idea to have a literate voting population, literacy tests really weren't fair because they were administered by local voting boards who got to decide who was and was not literate, so if you were an African American man you could have been a Pulitzer Prize winning author and still had your local board say, oh, you're not literate soy you're not eligible to vote."
Social Studies,"So, things like poll taxes and literacy tests and grandfather clauses, nowhere in the language of these voting laws did they say you can't vote if you're black but they were very carefully crafted to specifically single out and suppress the votes of African Americans. The Voting Rights Act also provided for federal examiners who had the power to register people to vote, to monitor elections in jurisdictions that had large black populations but few registered black voters."
Social Studies,"And this effort was enormously successful. By the end of 1965, 250,000 new African American voters had been registered in southern states. So, imagine how all of these new participants might change legislative outcomes. Okay, there are two more things I'd like to discuss. Now, one aspect of voting rights you might not have heard of is that until 1971, when the 26th Amendment was ratified, you had to be 21 years old to vote. Now, you can kinda guess at the reason behind this amendment based on its year."
Social Studies,"In 1971 the United States was involved in the Vietnam war and young men were being drafted. So, it would have been possible to be drafted for the U.S. Army at age 18 without ever having cast a vote. It's amazing to think that the right to vote for 18 year olds is less than 50 years old. The last piece of legislation that I want to talk about is the Motor Voter Act which was passed in 1993."
Social Studies,The official name of this was the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 but it's called the Motor Voter Act because it requires states to provide individuals with the opportunity to register to vote when they apply for or renew their driver's license.
Social Studies,"So, this makes it easier to register to vote in the first place and it makes it easier to maintain your voter registration if you move to a new state because you'll need to get a new driver's license so you can quickly make sure you get on the polls to vote in your new state."
Social Studies,"The Motor Voter Act also requires states to allow individuals to register by mail 30 days before a federal election and to allow individuals to register to vote if they're going to an office providing services to people with disabilities or public assistance. So, in general, the Motor Voter Act makes it easier for people to get registered to vote and to stay registered to vote. So, it kinda removes barriers to political participation."
Social Studies,"So, I know there's a lot of information here, it's a lot to take in, but the biggest thing to take away from this, again, is how participation affects outcomes. Who gets to vote, and more importantly who does vote in any given election, has an enormous impact on what kinds of politicians we elect and what kind of policies they enact.."
Social Studies,"So if your family has always been a Republican, and you're a Republican, and you just always support the Republican candidate, that would be party-line voting. Now, another behavior that political scientists will often talk about is the idea of rational choice. Rational choice, and this is the idea that someone would choose to vote for one candidate or another based on a perception of which candidate is going to benefit them the most, which one would it be rational for their own wellbeing."
Social Studies,"So for example, if you said, ""Hey, you know what? ""I really care about the corporate tax rate. ""I'm the CEO of a corporation. ""If my corporate tax rate were to go down, ""then I would be able to have a more thriving business, ""and I think one candidate is going to do better for me ""on the corporate tax rate, ""and I'm gonna vote for them because of that,"" that would be your rational choice, your model, what's driving your voting behaviors, what's gonna benefit me."
Social Studies,"Now, another classification that you will hear talked about is retrospective voting. Retrospective, and this is the idea that, hey, I'm just gonna vote for someone if it seems like they've been doing a good job, or if it seems like things have been improving under their watch."
Social Studies,"You're looking in retrospect, and this will often be for incumbents, and say, ""Hey, look, yeah, the last term was pretty good with them, ""so I'm gonna vote for them again."" Now, the last classification we will introduce in this video is the opposite of retrospective voting, and this is looking into the future, prospective voting."
Social Studies,"Prospective voting, and here, you might look at one candidate and say, ""Look, I think that they will be better for the country ""over the next four years."" You're not even necessarily thinking about your own personal benefit. You're thinking about the country as a whole, but you're looking forward. You're looking prospectively and thinking about, hey, candidate A I think is gonna do a better job, so I'm gonna vote for her."
Social Studies,"So with these classifications out of the way, let's look at some statements that you might hear from folks when they think about who they are voting for. So here, it says, ""The economy has been growing ""under Clinton so he has my vote."" So pause this video, and how would you classify this motivation for voting? Well, here, the person, the voter, is talking about the economy in the recent past. So this right over here is retrospective voting. So I'll draw a line right over there."
Social Studies,"That is retrospective voting. Clinton seems to have been doing a good job, where the economy's been growing under him, so he has my vote. Now what about this statement? ""I'm a lifelong Democrat so Obama has my vote."" Pause this video. What type of voting behavior is that? Well, here, the individual is clearly motivated by their party line. They're not talking about Obama being good for them, in particular. They're not talking about what Obama's gonna do in the future or what he's done in the recent past."
Social Studies,"They're just talking about his party and that being the motivation for voting for him. So that would be party line voting. Now what about this statement? ""Bush has ideas that will be really good for this country so I'm going to vote for him."" Pause this video."
Social Studies,"What type of voting behavior is that? Well, here, the voter's thinking prospectively, thinking about, well, what will Bush do for the country in the near future, ideas that will be really good for this country? So that is prospective voting, and then one more example... So if someone were to say, ""I think Mitt Romney will lower my taxes ""so I'm going to vote for him,"" what would that be? Pause the video again. Well, we have one choice left here, and that is indeed rational choice."
Social Studies,"This voter is voting based on what is going to benefit them. Mitt Romney's gonna lower their taxes, so they're gonna vote for them, and to be clear, it's not that everyone's behavior falls clearly into one of these categories. It oftentimes will be a mix of these categories."
Social Studies,"In fact, oftentimes someone might say, ""Hey, I like Obama 'cause he's a Democrat, ""and I think he's going to be good for me,"" and things might've been good under him, or the perception is that things are good under him, and they might believe that it's gonna be good going forward. Many voters will be motivated by a combination of these.."
Social Studies,"And this percentage varies pretty dramatically from region to region, amongst various demographic groups, we'll talk about that in a few minutes, and especially if you think about, even sometimes year to year and from country to country. There's some countries that have mandatory voting, where this number is a lot higher, other countries, for various reasons, this number could be lot lower."
Social Studies,"And one thing for you to think about if you're already of voting age, you might have already thought this, or if you're not voting yet, you will soon, what would drive you to vote, or what would drive you to not vote? Stay home, or somehow keep you from engaging in this political process."
Social Studies,"Well one thing that you'll often hear folks say is does my vote matter? Does my vote matter? And the typical response that you would get if you say that is well if everyone thought that, then democracy really won't function, so yes, your vote does matter. So that's the high-level way of thinking about it, but everyone thinks about this to a certain degree. And this idea of thinking about whether your vote matters a fancy way of describing that is you're thinking about your Political Efficacy."
Social Studies,"Political efficacy. Fancy political science term, but it's really just this idea of what's my belief about how politically effective I can be when I vote. If I am in a battleground State, say Florida, where even Presidential Elections have turned on a few hundreds of votes, in Florida, you might say, hey, I have high political efficacy. My vote does matter there."
Social Studies,"But some folks who live in a State that may be strongly leaning towards one party or another during a Presidential Election, say a California, that tends to go to a Democrat, or say a Texas, that tends to go to a Republican, regardless of which party you are, you'd say, well if I'm just one more Republican vote in Texas, does my vote matter? If I'm one more Democratic vote in California, does my vote matter? I would encourage you in both cases, your vote does matter."
Social Studies,"If everyone believed that, then our democracy does not function. Now a related idea to political efficacy is this idea of just how engaged are people? So I'll call that engagement. And this might be, well how much do they care? So beyond does my vote matter, there's a notion of do I care? There are certain elections where you might really like one candidate or might really dislike another candidate. You might think, hey, there's some big issues on the table that rally affect my life."
Social Studies,"So I might be more engaged. Or frankly, the various candidates, or the various political parties or community organizations might just be better at engaging the population. Now a third dimension beyond whether people believe their vote matters or how engaged they are in the issues or the candidates is the structure around voting itself."
Social Studies,"What State Laws are there around voting, and how easy or how hard is it to vote? So, for example, if there's a big window of time where people can vote, and if the polling places are really accessible, especially if they're available on say a holiday, then it might be easier for people to actually go to vote."
Social Studies,"But on the other hand, if they aren't that accessible, or if it's on a day where a lot of folks might need to work, or certain demographics might need to work, well they might be less likely to turn out. You also have laws around absentee ballots, or people being able to vote ahead of time. The easier it is logistically to vote, the more accessible it is, you're gonna get a higher turnout. Now political scientists don't just study voter turnout to understand the past."
Social Studies,"They look at the past to try and make predictions about the future. The next Congressional Election, the next Presidential Election, if they're trying to figure out which way it might go, you can't just survey people alone and say, well are you gonna vote for this candidate or that candidate because you also have to think about how likely are they to vote. And that likelihood could be based on various factors."
Social Studies,"It might be based on their age, it might be based on their race, it might be based on their education level. And to appreciate that, let's start taking a look at some data. This chart right over here shows voter turnout by sex and age in the 2008 US Presidential Election, where the blue bars are males, and the red bars are females. And then you can see the different age groups. And so pause this video. It's just fun to look at these things."
Social Studies,"What take-aways are there here? Well, you can see if you look at all of the eligible voters, total, 18 years and over, that women had a higher voter turn-out than men. 60.4% of eligible women vote, only 55.7% of men. Think about why that might be. What beliefs might women have around their own political efficacy relative to men? Maybe they're more engaged, maybe there's issues on the table that they care more about. And then if you look by age group, that trend tends to be true."
Social Studies,"It's most pronounced at the younger age groups, but then things get more and more equal as we go to the older age groups. The only place where that trend breaks down is in 75 years and over. And then you also have the general trend that older folks are more likely to vote. Once again, why is that? Here's another interesting chart. This is voter turnout by educational attainment, for the same US Presidential Election, 2008."
Social Studies,"So you can see that on average, across all education levels, you have this voter turnout around 58.2%, but the more educated people get, the more they're likely, or at least in that election, the more likely they were to actually vote. The more educated people are, they might feel more engaged, they might have a better belief that their vote is effective so they have a belief around political efficacy. This is voter turnout in the 2008 US Presidential Election by race and ethnicity."
Social Studies,"And so here you see that in that election, White voters had 64.8% turnout, Black voters 60.8%, and you can see Asian and Hispanic voters were much, much lower. What does this say about political engagement, and what does it say about their beliefs around political efficacy? And to see trends over time, I'm going to go to the site of FairVote.org, which is a really great non-partisan non-profit that is trying to think about how to we get a better democracy."
Social Studies,"So this diagram right over here shows voter turnout rates from 1916 to 2016. And there's two different lines here. The top one is in Presidential Elections, this is the 2016 Presidential Election, and this bottom line right over here is the Mid-Term elections. So this is where there isn't someone running for president."
Social Studies,"Why do you think that there's such a big gap here? That pretty consistently, you have a much higher voter turnout in this, depending on what year you look at, but say in 2016, you have a 60% voter turnout, while in the Mid-Term Election of 2014, you didn't even break 40%. You had little under 36% voter turnout. Why do you think you have this big gap? Well you could probably turn to these ideas of political efficacy and engagement."
Social Studies,"One thing that people talk about around Congressional Seats is that there tends to not be a lot of turnover around it. In other videos, we've talked about how the districts might be shaped to benefit incumbents, the entire process might be benefiting incumbents, so people might say, hey, I have a very low political efficacy here."
Social Studies,"Most Congresspeople tend to stay in office, so maybe that's why they don't really go out to vote, and there might be an engagement thing going on, that on Presidential years, where also Congresspeople are up for re-election, or up for election, the reason why people go out to vote is that Presidential Elections are these really big dramatic things, they take over the press, they take over everyone's attention. Now another interesting thing to think about is the trend."
Social Studies,"Why, say, in Presidential Elections, actually in Presidential and in Mid-Term Elections, do you have such high engagement in the 1960s, relative to, say, the 1980s and 1990s, where things got pretty low? One argument could be that the 1960s was a time of very high political engagement. You had the Vietnam War going on, you had the Civil Rights Movement. Now if we scroll down on FairVote right over here, we can see voter turnout in the 2016 elections by State."
Social Studies,"And the deeper the purple here, the higher the turnout. And so what patterns do you see here? And I'll give you a hint. Think about which States are battleground States. The ones that could flip either way, or the ones that could have flipped either way in the 2016 election. Well you can see the deeper purple are on States like Florida, or in States like Ohio, or Wisconsin and (mumbles), Michigan. These are indeed battleground States."
Social Studies,"So you can imagine folks in those States believed that they had higher political efficacy. Now in the 2014 elections, you don't see it as dramatic. This is a Mid-Term election year. So people are thinking a lot less about the Electoral College and Presidential Elections, so it isn't as all or nothing as they are in the Electoral College in the Presidential Elections, so you don't see it as pronounced. But if you go back to 2012, which was a Presidential Election year, you see the same pattern again."
Social Studies,"That the battleground States are a deeper color. So I will leave you there. You should vote, that's just my public service message, but it's interesting to think about why, in general, voter turnout might change.."
Social Studies,"What we're gonna talk about in this video is how people interface with the government, and in particular, what are the channels that allow them to communicate their preferences? So this is the government here. And of course the government is made up of people in the various branches. But let's say this is all of us as citizens right over here. Now, we're always interfacing with the government, or we're always interfacing with something that the government does."
Social Studies,"When we pay our taxes, we are interfacing with the government. When we try to, when we renew our passport, we are interfacing with the government. But what are the ways that we can communicate our preferences? Well, one very obvious way is through elections. Obviously we can vote someone in, we can vote someone out."
Social Studies,"We can tell the government, are we happy with what they've been doing or are we not? What issues are important to us and which issues are not? Another institution that's considered a way to link the citizens or the people of a country with its government is the media. Is the media. And I'll actually draw a two-way arrow here, because it's a way for the government to communicate with everyone else, and it's also a way for views to be heard and amplified, which the government might take note of."
Social Studies,"And these things would influence each other. Obviously the media is capable of influencing elections. Now, another way is interest groups. Another thing that we have talked about in previous videos. So this is interest groups. And it could actually be a two-way arrow where... Let me write this down. Interest groups. And we could be talking about groups like AARP, the NAACP, or the NRA."
Social Studies,"People could be members of that or contribute to that interest group, and they are going to lobby the government, they're going to try to influence elections, they'll oftentimes participate in the media, and interest groups are also going the other way, where they're trying to get their members to go in one way or another, to adopt views of the interest group or maybe influence elections in ways that the interest group might like."
Social Studies,"The fourth major channel for the citizenry to have this connection with the government is through political parties. Political parties. And these four different ways of connecting the government with people, ways for the people to communicate their preferences to the government, these are often listed in government classes, and collectively, they're known as linkage institutions. Linkage institutions. And they're called that because they link people with their government."
Social Studies,"But what I'm gonna focus on in this video in particular are political parties and the roles that they play. And we're all familiar with political parties in the United States. The two major political parties are the Democrats and the Republicans. But what do they fundamentally do? How do they play this role as linkage institutions? Well, the parties will have their platforms, so each of your political parties will have a party platform."
Social Studies,"And I encourage you to do a web search for the party platform, the Democratic platform or the Republican platform. It's really interesting to read, especially when you see how 180 degree opposite the two different groups can have on some very similar issues. But it's a way of saying, what do they believe in? And once they articulate this platform, it can have multiple effects. It can influence the members of the party, because common citizens indeed do become affiliated with various parties."
Social Studies,"But it could also influence the politicians that are members of that party in government. So it can affect both of those. Related to this idea of a party platform influencing citizens is this idea of voter mobilization and education. With an upcoming election, they'll go to people who are either already members of the party, who affiliate with a party or might be sympathetic to a party, and say, look, here are the big issues that are going to be affected by this upcoming election."
Social Studies,"Don't you care about it? If you vote for the other person, these things are going to go against you. Let's educate you on our view of what is good for the local government, what is good for the state, what is good for the country. Political parties also do candidate recruitment. A purist view of parties is, look, they care about changing the agenda or preserving an agenda, and so it's really important for them to field candidates that are capable of representing that agenda and capable of winning."
Social Studies,"If they don't do that, the political parties will eventually become irrelevant because if they don't have actual people who win elections and get into government, well, they'll also probably start losing followers, because people don't like to be part of a party that really does not have much influence. And so political parties are always going out there and saying, okay, the opposition party has a candidate like this. Here are the big issues on the table."
Social Studies,Let's see if we can get a candidate that can really take advantage of the circumstances in that region and has a high chance of winning while at the same time really representing what the party believes in.
Social Studies,"A fourth thing that parties will do, and this is related to candidate recruitment, is campaign management, where you will have professional political operatives associated with political parties, and they'll go from, they might be involved even in the candidate recruitment, but once they get those candidates, they'll say, hey, we're gonna help you win."
Social Studies,"Now, a fifth major function of political parties, at least in the United States, just as these arrows from the party platform to the general electorate, this is really, this right over here really is that voter mobilization and that voter education. This arrow right over here, where the party platform is influencing the government as it operates, a lot of this happens through the committee and party leadership system in legislatures."
Social Studies,"You have roles like majority party leader, majority party whip, minority party leader, and a lot of what they are doing is trying to take that party platform, what the party wants done, and make sure that all of these folks in government, who not, who, just like the citizenry, don't always believe the exact same thing. They might be representing very different regions. They might have different personal views. But to try to bring them in line with the party platform."
Social Studies,"And the idea is that if they unify around things and have a united front, that they're going to have more influence. Now, of course, that can sometimes go the other way, where both major parties are doing that, where it's all or nothing, you can get to a situation of gridlock, which we've talked about in other videos."
Social Studies,"But the big takeaway here, the common classification for the institutions that link the people to the government, linkage institutions, that allow individuals to communicate their preferences to policy-makers, are elections, the media, interest groups, and political parties. And political parties in particular. They have a platform. What do they represent? They mobilize and educate voters. They recruit candidates and manage their campaigns."
Social Studies,"And then once those candidates win, they have this leadership structure that tries to get them to be aligned, especially around that party platform.."
Social Studies,"And we also talk about, in that video on linkage institutions, how political parties are involved in voter mobilization, which is a fancy way of saying, hey getting people to vote, getting people energized about the election, to actually get to the polls. Sometimes going as far as getting buses, transporting them to the polling stations. And campaign management. Campaign management."
Social Studies,"And one thing that is really interesting to appreciate and it's really the focus of this video, is that both of these things have evolved over time. So for example, George Washington, the first President of the United States, he was not affiliated with any party and our first two presidential elections had no party association. But as soon as we get to the election of 1796, we start to see the development of faction."
Social Studies,"You have Hamilton on one side, becomes head of the Federalist Party and on the other side, headed by Madison, you have the Democratic-Republican Party. Democratic- Republican. And there's a nice irony to this because it was exactly those two gentlemen that not too far before 1796, if we go to the late 1780s, and their attempt to get the Constitution ratified in the Federalist Papers, they argue against faction. How faction can be bad for a government, for a nation."
Social Studies,"But they were the ones that led the split into faction and the split into parties. And from that time for over 100 years, all the way until we get to the early 1900s, early 1900s, you have some situations where the party leadership might pick candidates and some situation where the party members pick candidates and conventions. And so you have party leadership, leadership slash members who gets a hand pick. Hand pick candidates. So this part of the process was not so broadly democratic."
Social Studies,"Especially when we get to the second half of the 1800s. You have very strong party leaders, often called party bosses. Who almost had the individual power to pick candidates to represent one party or another. But in the early 1900s, there was a movement to say hey, you know what? This is not so democratic to handpick the candidates that people have to choose from. And so this is when you start to have the direct primary system."
Social Studies,"Where to choose the candidates that represent one party or another, you will hold elections. And those elections could be closed primaries where you have to be a registered Republican to vote for who represents Republican party. Or registered Democrat to see who represents the Democratic party. But they also have open primaries where anyone could vote in the Democratic primary or anyone could vote in the Republican primary. And this is happening to this day."
Social Studies,"Now, this change that has happened over roughly the last 100 years, you could imagine this has changed the power dynamic between the parties and the candidates. For this first over 100 years, the party is where a lot of the power was. But once you start having the direct primary, it becomes a lot more about candidate centered campaigns. Where things become much more about the position and the personality of the candidate than maybe as much about the party platform."
Social Studies,"And because of that, it has become more common in the last 100 or so years where even if someone is a registered Republican, they might vote the other way. Or if someone is a registered Democrat, they might vote the other way if a candidate is particularly appealing. For example, John F. Kennedy was the Democratic candidate for President in 1960. But many Republican Irish Catholics voted for him. Similarly, there's a group of folks known as the Reagan Democrats."
Social Studies,"Who are famous for despite their party affiliation with the Democrats, voted for President Reagan. And that was all around this idea that it was more about the candidate, especially at the presidential level than it is about the party. Now just as how the candidate picking process has evolved over time, so has the voter mobilization and the campaign management."
Social Studies,"In the early days, a lot of the voter mobilization, in fact, if we think about the late 1800s where you have this party boss structure, you had people sometimes going so far as even giving people things in order to go and vote for one candidate or another. Or exerting some type of pressure. The late 1800s, or the second half of the 1800s, especially in places like Chicago and New York were sometimes infamous for not, the necessarily cleanest elections."
Social Studies,"But as you get into the 20th century, especially the second half of the 20th century, and now the 21st century, things have become much, much more sophisticated. So if we go to the 20th century, you have significant use of mass media, mass media. And as you go into TV and newspaper, radio, and newspaper has always been a factor in political elections going all the way back to the founding of the United States. And then as you go into the 21st century, things have gotten a lot more targeted."
Social Studies,"Obviously you can have email campaigns. You can start to leverage social media. And the 21st century in particular, things like email campaigns and social media has allowed for very specific targeting to voters. What do I mean by targeting? Well, let's say you really care about economic issues while your cousin who lives across town really cares about social issues. The same candidate, instead of sending both of you the same email, might send you a targeted message that speaks to what you care about."
Social Studies,"And this has actually become very, very sophisticated in the last few years. I'll leave you there. But the big takeaway here is political parties have been around for a while in the United States. But they have been evolving. In this video, I'm not even talking about how their platforms have evolved. And how their associations have evolved. But this is talking about how they have evolved in terms of picking candidates. And how that has changed the nature of campaigns."
Social Studies,"And also, how primarily through the changes in culture and the changes in technology, how they can go about mobilizing and managing campaigns has also changed.."
Social Studies,"But the reason why people say third parties is because in the United States, you have two dominant parties. You have the Republicans and you have the Democrats. And so any other party is considered to be a third party after those first two big, dominant parties. So here are some of the logos of some of the, I would say, major third parties in the United States. And I'm gonna put major in quotes because they don't have much of a say in our government today."
Social Studies,"You have the Libertarian Party, that is very focused on people's individual liberties. They generally think about the government doing as little as possible. That whenever the government strives to get bigger, it infringes on people's liberties, either in the economic sphere or in the social sphere. The Green Party is also very pro-civil liberties, but you can also imagine, because it's called the Green Party, it is very concerned with the environment."
Social Studies,"Now, this third, third party, and there's many more than just these three. This is the Reform Party. And the Reform Party is really interesting because it was started by Ross Perot in 1995. And this was after, in 1992, Ross Perot ran as an Independent candidate for President. And he did surprisingly well. He got nearly 20 percent of the popular vote."
Social Studies,"But an interesting question is even though he got 20 percent of the popular vote in 1992, and even though in the Reform Party, it had some reasonable support even in the 1996 election, how come we don't see Congress people who represent the Reform Party? And there's two real answers here. One is, the winner-take-all system. Winner - take - all. So if we're dealing with a situation where even if a third party gets 20 percent of the vote, they're not going to get any representation for it."
Social Studies,"And you can contrast that with a proportional representation system like you have in some Parliaments. So in some countries, their Parliament is elected by proportional representation. So let's say that 20 percent vote for Party A. Let's say 70 percent vote for Party B. And then the remainder, 10 percent, vote for Party C. In a Parliamentary proportional representation system, Party C would get roughly 10 percent of the seats in the Parliament. But that's not the way it works in our government."
Social Studies,"In our government, in almost any jurisdiction, if you had a voter breakdown like this, well, Party B would win. Or maybe sometimes Party A would win, and even if Party C does get some votes, it's never going to cross the threshold to actually get representation. Now, with that said, this doesn't fully explain why we don't we see more third party representation in say the United States Congress."
Social Studies,"Because there are countries that have more third party representation, even though they don't have proportional representation. Now another reason that's often cited for why we don't see third party representation is that the major parties, the Republicans and Democrats oftentimes incorporate the third party's messages into their own. To get a sense of this, I'm gonna show you a little bit of an excerpt from a Reform Party ad in 1996."
Social Studies,"And at that time, they were saying things that neither the Democrats or the Republicans were saying very strongly. And I want you to think about, when you hear it, whether some of those messages have, later on, become parts of either the Republican or the Democratic candidate's messages. - Washington is selling our future to the special interests. - Don't waste your vote on someone who will sell you out. - Ross Perot is the only candidate who will work - For our interests, instead of the special interests."
Social Studies,"- Just vote for Ross. - Because you own this country. - So as you saw in that ad from the Reform Party, there's a lot of talk about the influence of special interests and how people need to take their government back. And if you fast-forward to the 2016 Presidential election, you had two major forces, actually one on the Republican side and one on the Democratic side. On the Republican side, you have Donald Trump, who's echoing the need to focus on special interests."
Social Studies,"That Washington is a swamp, that it needs to be drained. It wasn't obvious from that ad, but Ross Perot in 1992 was ringing the alarm bells about NAFTA and free trade and saying why it would be bad for the United States. And in 2016, you heard many of these same things from the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. Same thing with Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side. He echoed the need to take a second look at free trade. And that special interests had taken over Washington.."
Social Studies,"This could be groups of corporations. It could represent an industry. It could represent a social cause. And we're going to look at some major interest groups in the United States in a few minutes, but some can be quite large and some can be quite small. But what you see from the iron triangle is how these parties can influence each other."
Social Studies,"An interest group can give electoral support to a member of Congress by getting its members to go out and vote for that member of Congress, or maybe even doing advertising for that member of Congress or giving direct financial support. In exchange, they might get friendly legislation and oversight, and that'll happen because a congressperson who got that support from the interest group might have a friendly ear to that interest group and might be open to hanging out with lobbyists from that interest group."
Social Studies,"The term lobbyist, or lobbying is believed to originate in 17th century England where people who wanted to influence members of Parliament would hang out in the lobby of the parliamentary building waiting to talk to those members of Parliament. And that's what essentially lobbyists do today."
Social Studies,"They try to meet with congresspeople or meet with the staff of congresspeople and try to influence the types of bills that are introduced to Congress for consideration and how various members should vote for those bills. Now bureaucracy, these are the folks who for the most part are doing the work of actually running the government and they have influence and they can dictate what regulations are going to be, who gets various contracts, and so you can imagine that might be of interest to interest groups."
Social Studies,"Now to make tangible what some of these interest groups are, you have entities like the AFL-CIO, which stands for the American Federation of Labor, Congress of Industrial Organizations. And this is a meta organization of a bunch of labor unions and as you can imagine they are going to advocate for labor-friendly policies. It might be things that favor the manufacturing industry or that favor employees' rights to collectively negotiate with their employer."
Social Studies,"It might be advocating for trade policies, which would be perceived as more friendly to the American worker. Its membership is roughly 12.5 million people and so just getting them out to vote can have a significant influence on elections. You have groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and what's interesting here, this membership of over 300,000, this isn't just individuals. This includes corporations."
Social Studies,"Even though the Chamber of Commerce does not have the biggest budget of the groups we're gonna look at, it is actually consistently the biggest lobbying group, spending most of this money on lobbying. And they're going to try to advocate for business-friendly policies in our government. You have groups that advocate for social causes like the NAACP, they don't have a huge budget but they are considered very, very influential when it comes to issues surrounding minority rights."
Social Studies,You also have very influential groups like the National Rifle Association. And when we compare the NRA to some of these other groups it's interesting to think about the number of issues they concentrate their efforts on.
Social Studies,"For example, the Chamber of Commerce might be thinking about a very broad array of policy decisions that might affect commerce, that might affect businesses, while the National Rifle Association and its members, and this is a significant membership here, is likely to be much more focused on a narrower set of issues around gun rights and gun ownership."
Social Studies,"You have the American Medical Association, which despite its relatively small membership here is highly, highly influential because these 240,000 people are for the most part physicians, who many of us are very used to listening to. You have the American Association for Retired Professionals which has a membership of 37 million people and a budget of 1.6 billion. So these entities can be very large and very, very influential. Now as I mentioned, not all of these dollars go directly to lobbying."
Social Studies,"They could be spending money on voter education. They could be spending money on legal funds to advocate for cases that are in their interest. They could be giving direct support to various candidates or to various parties. They could be advertising in the media for their cause. But if we think about directly lobbying, this chart right over here is quite interesting."
Social Studies,"It comes from OpenSecrets.org and if you're really intrigued by understanding more of how money and influence come together in American politics I encourage you to go to their site. But this is a list in 2017 of the top spenders in lobbying in the United States, and as I mentioned you see here at the top the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at $82 million, and this isn't even the most they've ever spent in a year. There's some years where it is well over $150 million that they've spent."
Social Studies,"The National Association of Realtors, the Business Roundtable, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. And this money is, for the most part, to pay lobbyists who will meet with members of our government to directly advocate for certain policies."
Social Studies,"Now an interesting thing to think about is what positive things might be done by interest groups, and what potentially negative things might be there and how equitable is this system? The positive things, folks could argue, are hey, they could work on voter education."
Social Studies,"Many issues that policy makers are trying to decide on are quite complex, so it might be good to have experts weighing in, but on the other hand, it might seem like money is disproportionately influential and that industries that generate a lot of money could have a disproportionate amount of influence and they could potentially use that influence to further benefit those industries to give them even more power and influence. So I will let you decide.."
Social Studies,"Now, it turns out that if you go back over, roughly, the last 100 years, in Presidential elections that had and incumbent, that had a sitting President running for a second term or maybe a third, or a forth term in the case of FDR, you have more than 80% of the time, it goes to the incumbent. And this right over here is a picture of the Presidential Debates from C-SPAN and this in 2012 between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. And President Obama, of course, was the incumbent and he went on to win."
Social Studies,"And, once again, not unusual, this happened 80% of the time. The last time that a challenger was able to unseat an incumbent was in 1992 when you have President Clinton was able to beat President George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush's father. George H. W. Bush and the time before ... and this is 26 years ago, 26 years before the time of the making of this video. And, to go even before that, the last time before 1992 would have been 1980, when Reagan is able to beat Carter."
Social Studies,"So, this is a very unusual thing for a challenger to be able to beat an incumbent. Now one thing that I would like you to do is pause this video. Think about why incumbents might have such an advantage. Okay, so there's many scholarly papers written about the idea of the incumbent advantage, both at the Presidential level and at other levels. But we can come up with some ideas as to why the incumbent has the advantage."
Social Studies,"One is people already imagine that individual as President because they are the President. On top of that, because they are already President, they've had many years of being in the national spotlight. And even during the Presidential campaign, they are still the President and so they have that bully pulpit that President Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt talked about. Bully pulpit, where they can get people's attention when they want to."
Social Studies,"Even though the challenger might be well-funded, and the press is definitely going to pay attention to the challenger and give them a lot of voice. Because the President is the President, they have the State of the Union Address, they can call Special Sessions of Congress, they have regular press briefings, and so they have a much larger voice even compared to a very prominent challenger. On top of that, there might be some notion of experience and this idea of experience can go in many directions."
Social Studies,"No matter which candidate has more life experience, which one is older, one could argue that no one has ever really ever been the President unless they are the President. And, so someone who has been in that job for four years has been able to build some experiences that maybe they'll be able to build on for their second term. While, the other person might have to, no matter what they've done in the rest of their life, being the President is fairly new experience."
Social Studies,"The other idea is that they are experienced campaigners. That they have already run a successful Presidential campaign and this is their second time around, which could help in winning that campaign. Another idea that might help an incumbent... and once again, this is me thinking about it, I encourage you to think about it and see if you buy these or could come up with others... is maybe there is a sense of patriotism."
Social Studies,"That people are used to thinking of the incumbent as their President for the last several years and so they feel some sense of loyalty to them. This could even be supercharged if maybe it's in wartime or if the country is facing some type of foreign policy crisis that they want to stand behind the person during that time of crisis. They don't want to change who is in charge in the middle of a war or something like that. So, I will leave you there."
Social Studies,These are just some ideas why we see this phenomenon of an incumbent advantage. I encourage you to think about why this is happening..
Social Studies,"And a national convention for one of the parties will look something like this. This is the Democratic national convention in 2008. You have all the delegates over here, and everyone's all excited and they start to cheer lead for their party."
Social Studies,"and for their candidate the republican national convetion looks very similar And although there's a lot of energy here there actually isn't a lot of suspense Going into the convention we usually know already who the candidates for each of the parties are going to be And that's because each of the states have their own selection process for picking a candidate As we get the results from we know how many delegates they're going to send to the convention and who(m) they're going to vote for But there's two ways they can select those candidates or those delegates at the national convention They could either run a caucus or they could run a primary And I'll start with primary because that's a little more intuitive It's kind of like just a election that is based on party for whom do you want to be your nominee at coming out of the convention So for any given state they will have both a Democratic primary and a Republican primary And on the democratic primary let's say candidate A gets 40% of the votes on that election Candidate B gets 30% of the votes and let's say candidate C gets another 30% What will happen is is that state's delegates on the democratic side So let's say that that state just for convenience Let's say they have ten delegates On the democratic side, that means that these delegates will go on to the national convention and represent the different candidates proportionally So out of these ten delegates 40% or four will represent candidate A Three will represent candidate B and three will represent candidate C when they go to the national convention On the republican side it's a little bit more nuance you could have similar results A gets 40% B gets 30% and C gets - now let me do different letters so these aren't the same candidates Let me do candidates D, E and F So you could have candidate D, candidate E, candidate F and let's say - let me do the percentages slightly different for fun So let's he has 45% over here let's say he has 25% over here and then let's say you have candidate F with 30% over here On the republican side it depends from state to state Some states will do it similar to the democrats where the delegates represent the candidates proportion to the votes they have While some other states have it 'winner take all' And so for example in a winner take all state, candidate D will get all 10 delegates And the reason why states do that is it's a stronger incentive for candidates to show up to that state if they feel like their in the running Because if they throw enough money and marketing in that state, that's a big deal to take all of the votes."
Social Studies,"On the other hand, if you're a smaller candidate and you don't think you can take it all, it may be a disincentive for you to even show up to that state and you might want to focus on the states where you can actually get some delegates So that's all the primary is."
Social Studies,"It's really a- you can kind of view it as an election That sell separately on the democratic side, separately on the republican side an those are used by the state's parties to decide which delegates go to the national party and whom those delegates are going to vote for A caucus, the point is the same thing To figure out who are your delegates that are going to go to the national convention and whom are they going to vote for but the process is a little bit different In a caucus, you essentially have- people get together in these events, these caucuses in different in these events, these caucuses in different precincts, and the most famous of these are the Iowa caucuses So in small precincts you'll have groups of fifty to a hundred people get together, and the different parties will have different ways of going about it but they have processes in place where people try to market for different candidates they campaign for different candidates and sometimes they'll have a cut-off that if one of the candidates at one of the precincts don't get at least 15% of the votes then those people who supported that candidate will have to give their support to another candidate they make sure that all of the delegates represent at least a certain threshold of voters but there's different processes in place But the bottom line is that at each of these pre-syncs they'll select delegates and then those delegates will then go on to the county conventions and then those delegates at the county conventions now these are representing more people will then pick delegates to the district conventions and then at the district conventions they will pick candidates to the state conventions and at the state conventions they will pick the final candidates that will go on to the national convention No the two most famous caucuses or primaries are the Iowa caucus which takes place in Iowa You have the New Hampshire primary which of course takes place in New Hampshire And they are important not because they pick so many delegates that those delegates will tip the balance necessarily These are small states they don't have that many delegates compared to California or Texas or Florida but what's important about both of them is that they happen very very very early on in the primary season and because they happen early on in the primary season the candidates that come off with the lead here it is easier for them to raise money they say 'Oh I want to give my money to a winner, you know I don't want to give it to a candidate who is just going to blow it and lose the money and lose the election regardless' So it gives you that."
Social Studies,"It also gives a big signal for who's a front runner because there tends to be dynamics for whoever wins or comes in in second place in the Iowa or New Hampshire primary that those are the people that everyone should pay attention to they get more fundraising it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy More people all of a sudden take a serious look at them Now the Iowa caucus just to be clear the primaries all happen in one day and you get the one, the polling results when people exit the polls and you also get the final result pretty quickly This caucus process actually takes place over many many months five months in the case of the Iowa caucus And the result, the thing that the press focuses on is not this final result, of who are the actual delegates that go to the national convention The thing that the press focuses on are the precinct convention where people get together Because coming out of those precinct conventions the state parties get the information on how many candidates each delegates won going into now the county convention And this, this is the indicator that the press and the media and everyone else likes to use to see who's a front runner in that specific party's primary And the reason why the Iowa caucus in particular gets so much importance is because it is the first caucus These results come out before anything else The New Hampshire primary this is the first time that you have direct voting for candidates so you're getting I guess getting a more direct number or your not having it distorted or maybe cleaned up depending on how you view it by all of the different processes that might take place within the precinct convention."
Social Studies,"And let's say there's also three folks in your district who are interested in running for that position who associate themselves with the Republicans. There are some situations where you can have just a big preliminary election where they all run against each other. We'll talk about that in a second. But, usually you have a situation where they try to think about, well, let's just pick one to represent the Democrats, and let's just pick one to represent the Republicans."
Social Studies,"And so that's where the primary election would happen. So you would have a Democratic primary where these folks would run against each other, and whoever gets the most votes would then go on to represent the Democratic Party in that election. So let's say that person wins, then they will go on into the general election."
Social Studies,"Likewise, these three folks would run against each other in the Republican primary, and whoever gets the most votes, let's say it's that person right over there, they would go to the general election to go against likely the Democrat right over here. So this is the person who would go against the Democrat. And then they are going to compete in the general election against each other, head to head, and then whoever gets that would get the congressional seat."
Social Studies,"Now even in this type of primary, you could call this a partisan primary, there's an interesting question. Who votes in this Democratic Party primary? Who votes in that? And, who votes in the Republican Party primary? And there's actually two systems for this, or two general buckets, and there's some nuances from region to region."
Social Studies,"But one way is that only registered Democrats could vote in the Democratic primary, pick who represents their party in the general, and only registered Republicans can vote in the Republican primary. That situation where only registered folks can vote in their respective primaries, that is called a closed primary. It's called closed because it's not open to just anyone who wants to vote in the primary. Only the people who have already registered in that party can vote."
Social Studies,"Now you can imagine the opposite of that is the open primary, so open primary, where even though these are partisan primaries, you are trying to figure out who's going to represent the Democrats, and who's going to represent the Republicans, you can allow people who are either not affiliated with a party or even people who are affiliated with the other party to vote in your primary."
Social Studies,"So, for example, in this Democratic primary, there could be, for some reason, folks who feel passionate about this candidate who are actually registered Republicans but who they wanna vote in this primary. Or you could have people who are unaffiliated who would vote in this primary if we are dealing with an open primary."
Social Studies,"Now one interesting question is, is how could the dynamics change if we're dealing with a open versus a closed primary? Well, political scientists like to think a lot about this, and even states like to think about this, in terms of what is appropriate? What is most representative? What gives the people of that state the fairest voice in their elections? Now people who like closed primaries might say, well look, we're trying to figure out who represents the Democratic Party; it should only be Democrats."
Social Studies,"We're trying to figure out who represents the Republican Party; it should only be Republicans. Now criticism of closed primaries might be, well, if you limit who gets to vote in the primary, then these candidates are only going to cater to the base. They're only going to cater to the interests of people in their party, and in particular, they might cater to people who are at the extremes of their party. For example, let's say we have a situation like this."
Social Studies,"Let's say that this is the population right over here, and people at the right end, these are conservatives. Conservatives. Conservative. And these folks right over here are liberal. And if you were to look at the population as a whole, let's say the distribution in the population. Let's say it looks something like this."
Social Studies,"You have some people here who are quite liberal, and then you have actually the bulk of the people who are some place in between, and then you have another bump of folks who are actually quite conservative. So you would guess that, hey, look, a view that's someplace in between, maybe a moderate view, would actually maybe be most representative of the people."
Social Studies,"But if you have closed primaries, what might happen? Well, the Democratic primary, the people who would be eligible to vote, would be these people right over here. It would be these people, the people who have registered as Democrats. And in the Republican primary, well, if it's closed, only the registered Republicans would vote, maybe these people right over here. And these people in the middle, these would be the unaffiliated-with-a-party people."
Social Studies,"And so, if you have different candidates here, let's say that this is candidate one, where they're here on the spectrum. This is candidate two, which is here on the spectrum, and candidate three is here on the spectrum. You could imagine that for this population, they're all going to say things that speak to this group. And in particular, they might actually, the person who wins, might actually be very successful of getting the people at the extreme left right over here."
Social Studies,"And so that person maybe is a person who goes off to the general election. Likewise, the same thing might be happening on the Republican side. You have the different candidates. Maybe their personal views put 'em right over here. And it's this person who is furthest to the right who's really able to appeal to the folks right over here who ends up winning and represents the Republican Party."
Social Studies,"Well then what happens in the general election? The entire population has to pick between folks that actually are more indicative of either extreme. That maybe the closed primary system, it wouldn't have been so good for a candidate who is reasonably moderate on the Democratic side. Maybe someone is there, or a candidate who is right over here. Or maybe there's a candidate whose views are right in the middle."
Social Studies,"First of all, if they want to represent a party, they would have to moot pick one of these parties. And then to have a shot, they would have to represent views that would be to the left or to the right of where they truly are, and maybe they wouldn't have as good of a shot as the people who actually are quite liberal or the folks who are actually are quite conservative. So that's a criticism of the closed primary."
Social Studies,"An open primary might make this a little bit better, because you have these registered Democrats here. But folks from here might decide, hey, I wanna go vote there as well. So they might moderate things. Or folks from here might say, hey, I wanna go vote here as well. Now critics of an open primary would say, well those aren't the people who really are registered in that party."
Social Studies,"And you could also have a phenomenon of rating, where people maybe on the Republican side could say, look, you know what? I know who's gonna win here. The Republican primary doesn't need my vote. I'm gonna go and try to pick the weakest candidate on the other side so that in the general election, my candidate has the best shot. Now third type of primary is known as a blanket primary, often a nonpartisan blanket primary."
Social Studies,"In a nonpartisan blanket primary, instead of going through this partisan process, all the candidates here would go into one preliminary election. And in that preliminary election, the top two candidates would then go on to the general election. So two candidates are going to move on in a blanket primary, a nonpartisan blanket primary, and what's interesting there is you can actually get two candidates from the same party going. Proponents of a blanket primary say, hey, this is the fairest of it all."
Social Studies,"Instead of making things partisan, just let everyone run against everyone else, and the top two will then get to the general election. Now you'll see all three of these in the United States at congressional elections or even statewide elections. But if we're thinking about presidential elections, we're thinking mainly about these two."
Social Studies,"And when we're talking about presidential election, these are part of primary season where it's thinking about how many delegates candidates would get during the national convention where they actually pick their candidate. I'll leave you there. It's an interesting way to think about the different ways of voting, especially voting in a preliminary way to get down to a fewer number of candidates. I'll let you think about which one you prefer.."
Social Studies,"And it could happen as early as November 2, and it could happen as late as November 8. And it's going to be the Tuesday after the first Monday in the month. So it'll be November 2 if the first Monday is November 1, and it'll be November 8 if the first Monday is November 7. And so you go on election day, and you will see a ballot that will have the presidential candidates. It'll have their parties there. It will have the vice presidential candidates, and you'll vote for one of them."
Social Studies,"But in actuality, when you are voting for Candidate A-- and let's say Candidate A is a Democrat-- you're not actually voting for Candidate A. You're actually voting for a slate of electors who promise to vote for that candidate. And it isn't in most states proportional based on what proportion of people vote for one candidate or another. In most of the states, except for Maine and Nebraska, it is a winner take all system."
Social Studies,"So what do I mean by that? So right here, you have the breakdown of the United States, by state, of how many electors words each state gets. And the number of electors is essentially the number of congressmen that that state has. For example, California has two senators. Every state has two senators. California has two senators and 53 congressmen. And those of you who aren't familiar with it, every state gets two senators, and the House of Representatives is dictated by population."
Social Studies,"California is a huge state, two senators, 53 representatives. You have Texas, two senators and it has 32 representatives. You go to Louisiana, you have two senators and you have seven representatives. So the electors per state is based on the total number of congressmen, so the number of senators plus the number of representatives. That's what gives us 55 in California, nine in Louisiana, 34 in Texas. But what's interesting here is it's a winner take all system in every state except for Nebraska and Maine."
Social Studies,"In every other state, if I get 51% of the vote in Texas, I get all 34 electoral votes in the Electoral College. If I get 51% or even if I get 50.1%, just a slight majority of the votes in California, I will get all of the votes for California in the Electoral College. And in general, or in actuality, the president is whoever gets the majority of the electoral votes in the United States. And right now, that threshold is, or that magic number-- you could think of it that way-- is 270 Electoral College votes."
Social Studies,"If no candidate is able to hit this threshold of 270 Electoral College votes, then it will go to the US Congress. And in the US Congress, it's interesting, because it isn't one congressman, one vote. Or actually, I should say the US House of Representatives. It'll go to the US House of Representatives. And it won't be one representative, one vote. What will happen is the representatives in each state will vote together, and each state will get only one vote."
Social Studies,"So in a tiebreaker, the big states really, really lose out, because in a tiebreaker, Texas will get only one vote. California will get one vote. And Alaska will get one vote, and Rhode Island will get one vote. So Rhode Island will have just as much say in a tiebreaker as California will over who will be president. Then they'll just keep voting until someone gets a simple majority of the votes by state. Now, there's one other twist here."
Social Studies,"It's that the District of Columbia-- Washington, DC right over here-- in Congress gets no representatives. They have no senators, and they have no representatives. But they do get three electoral votes when it comes to deciding who is going to be president."
Social Studies,"Now, you might already be getting a sense here that maybe this winner take all system might lead to some distortions, and the biggest distortion of all is you can imagine a candidate who wins the popular vote and loses the election or loses in the Electoral College. And you might think, well, gee, how can that happen? And the way to think about it is, imagine someone-- let's say someone gets-- with the states that they win, they get huge majorities."
Social Studies,"So let's say there's a conservative candidate, and he or she gets huge majorities in the states they win. 80% in Texas. They get 80% in Mississippi. They get 80% in Oklahoma. The get huge majorities in the states that they win. And the states that they lose, they barely lose. And they barely lose those really big states. So let's say in Florida, that candidate gets 49% of the vote. So they had a lot of votes in Florida, but not enough to win it. The other person, let's say, gets 51%."
Social Studies,"All 27 go to the other candidate. Let's say the same thing happens in California. That candidate got 49% of the vote. The opponent, let's say, gets 51% of the vote. All 55 go to California. You get no credit for that 49%. You get no credit for that 49% in Florida. So in this situation, this candidate might actually end up with the majority, barely losing the states they lose, and trouncing the other candidate in the states that they win, but despite that, actually getting fewer Electoral College votes."
Social Studies,"Now, there's a few clarifications I want to make, especially ones that have confused me in the past. One of them is because you have the same number of Electoral College votes as you have US representatives plus senators, there's kind of this feeling that maybe each district sends its own elector to the state capital to decide who the president is. And it doesn't quite work that way. So this right here is the panel of electors for Louisiana in 2008."
Social Studies,"And you can see right over here, each of the parties have their own slate of electors. And these are either decided by the party themselves, or they're decided by the candidates' teams. And even though you have someone here for each district and then you have these at-large candidates, it's not like-- let's take a situation. This actually happened in Louisiana, where John McCain got a majority of the state. So John McCain and Sarah Palin got a majority of the state."
Social Studies,"It's not the case that-- let's say in the second district, which is New Orleans, let's say that the second district, a majority of the people actually voted for Barack Obama. It is not the case that Kenneth Garrett in 2008 would have been the chosen elector. Even though they divide things by district and they have these at-large candidates, it is actually a state-wide election. So they don't look at who won each of the districts. They just say, look, John McCain and Sarah Palin won the entire state."
Social Studies,"So all of these electors are the ones that are going to go to the state capital in December and decide who they want to pledge their vote for. So even if Obama won just the Second Congressional District, that's not how it's thought about in the Electoral College. It's just a state-wide election. McCain got the majority of the state. All of the electors will be chosen from McCain's slate or from the Republican Party slate. And then they're going to go to the state capital."
Social Studies,"In the case of Louisiana, it would be Baton Rouge. And they will decide who they want to pledge their votes to. And all of the electors in all of the states go to their designated location, usually the state capital, on the same day. And usually that is some day in December. And they pick the president, although by that point, everyone knows who the president is, because the actual election was in early November."
Social Studies,"And people know which way the votes went and which way the actual Electoral College votes went. Now, I did mention that there are two states that don't do this winner take all, Nebraska and Maine. And in Nebraska and Maine, when you go vote, it really is by congressional district. Nebraska has three congressional districts."
Social Studies,"So in those three congressional districts, if one of them goes to the Democrat and two goes to the Republican, then they'll have one electoral vote for the Democrat and two for the Republican. And then they have two at-large votes that are decided the same way, in kind of the winner take all basis. If you get 51% of the vote on a statewide basis, you get the two at-large votes. Same thing for Maine, but Maine has two congressional districts. So two of the congressional districts could go either way."
Social Studies,"And then the at-large are based on a state-wide vote. Now, you could imagine the other kind of unfair thing here, other than the popular vote versus the Electoral College vote. You could imagine it makes some states better represented than others. So if you just divide population by the number of electors, you see the larger states, each elector is representing many, many more people. This is California right here. Each elector is representing over 600,000 people."
Social Studies,"And in the smaller states-- this is Wyoming right here-- each elector is representing under 200,000 people. So in Wyoming, people are getting kind of three times the representation as they would in California on a per capita vote."
Social Studies,"But what makes it even a little bit more skewed, because it's winner take all and the candidates aren't silly and they want to make sure that they spend their money and their visits and their time in the most leveragable way, it actually creates this weird scenario where candidates will often ignore huge parts of the population. And they ignore them because those huge parts of the population are unlikely to swing one way or the other."
Social Studies,"So for example, California is very reliably Democratic and Texas is very reliably Republican. So this right here-- this is a fascinating graph, at least in my mind-- it shows where George W. Bush and John Kerry spent the last five weeks of the 2004 election. Let me close that right there. This top graph shows where they actually spent their time, so each of these little hands here is a visit in those final five weeks."
Social Studies,"And each of these dollar signs is a million dollars spent on marketing and advertising, on ads and whatever else, in those states. And you can see, California and Texas, the two biggest states, they didn't spend enough money to the threshold to get dollar a sign written there. So they didn't even spend $1,000,000 on these huge states. They only had a few visits to California, and Texas had no visits in the final five weeks."
Social Studies,"So what happens is that candidates spend a disproportionate amount of attention and money in the states that are more likely to swing one way or another. So the people in Florida or in Ohio-- so this is Ohio and Florida-- got a ton more attention, especially on a per person basis, than the people in Texas."
Social Studies,"It hovers all the way up here. It stands to reason that if you have two candidates for every office, one from each party, it would be about 50% of the time the candidates would be reelected, but it's so much more than that. In this video on Congressional elections, I want to talk about some of the structural aspects. That is, the way things are set up in Congressional elections that leads to this really high number."
Social Studies,"What are the advantages of being an incumbent, that is, the person who already holds a political office? So what kind of advantages does an incumbent have simply for already occupying an office? Well, say maybe there's a Senate race between Candidate Green, call her Amy Green, and Candidate Rose. Maybe he's Ken Rose."
Social Studies,"Now what sort of advantages Amy Green just because she already holds the Senate seat? Well, one of her advantages is that she has a staff, she has people whose job it is to answer the phone calls of constituents, make them feel heard. They can do all sorts of things to help her. She also has the advantage of mail. Members of Congress can send out mail for free, whereas Candidate Rose over here has to pay for staff and pay for mail. Already, that's a lot of money."
Social Studies,"The other thing that Candidate Green has going for her is name recognition. She's already been a successful candidate, which shows that she knows how to win an election and there's a lot of advantage to having name recognition. It's its own kind of advertising. Are you going to vote for someone you've never heard of before or someone who frequently appears in the media who could be going to local or state events, school openings."
Social Studies,"You get a lot of face time simply from occupying a seat, and that's free advertising as well. The last aspect is money."
Social Studies,"Because of this incumbency advantage, and this is little bit of a repeating cycle, interest groups, lobbyists, and others are far more likely to give money to the candidate who is already in a position because they know that candidate is likely to win and therefore, their money is going to get them access to that candidate who will hear out their concerns and perhaps look upon them favorably. So compared to all of this, Candidate Rose has a really uphill battle."
Social Studies,"He's got to pay for a lot of things that the incumbent doesn't have to, he doesn't have the name recognition or the automatic media attention, and he's viewed less favorably by the people who might give money. He's a bit of an unknown quantity. Another advantage that incumbents have is that they get to draw voting districts at least every 10 years in response to the US Census and changes in populations, the districts and states must be redrawn."
Social Studies,"Politicians do that redrawing and they tend to use this opportunity to create safe districts for themselves, safe being districts where the voters who are arranged geographically will be likely to vote them back into power. Those in power will also generally use this opportunity to attempt to harm their opponents in a process known as gerrymandering. There are two other major factors that contribute to whether a Congress member is reelected. One of them is in each state, the form that their primary takes."
Social Studies,"Some states like Iowa have caucuses where party members gather to vote on who their nominee should be. These are very tightly controlled by the party. There are closed primaries where only the registered members of a party may vote on their party's nominees for election, and then there are open primaries, where any registered voter can vote for a party nominee, even if they belong to the opposing party."
Social Studies,"So the form estates primary takes as a strong effect on how tight the party control is over that process. The last factor affecting Congressional elections is whether or not they coincide with a presidential election. There's much higher voter turnout for presidential elections since there's a great deal of interest in them and money spent on them, and that means that you tend to get a broader sample of the population."
Social Studies,"More people are likely to vote, so you'll have a better idea of how the American voting public is feeling more generally, but in midterm elections, which are those elections that don't fall at the same time as a presidential election, voter turnout is lower, and that means that it's gonna be the really engaged voters who are often strongly aligned with a party that will come out."
Social Studies,"Midterm elections also tend to punish the party in power, so when the president is highly regarded and doing well, his or her party tends to gain seats, but if the president is doing poorly or has a low public opinion rating, then Congressional seats will often go to the opposite party. You can see here this chart of net gain and loss of the president's party, and in most cases, the president will gain a few followers in the first midterm election. See here, George W. Bush, 2002."
Social Studies,"His party gained both House and Senate seats, but often in the sixth year of a two-term presidency, voters harshly punish the president's party. You can see that in George W. Bush's sixth year, the Republicans lost 30 House seats and six Senate seats, and a similar effect happened with Barack Obama in 2014. The Democrats lost 13 House seats and nine Senate seats. So there's a strong correlation with the president's party and the fates of members of Congress who belong to that party.."
Social Studies,"If you look at nominal dollars for the House of Representatives, so this is just the actual dollar amount, you see it's almost grown by a factor of four or five. But even if you adjust it for inflation, the cost has doubled for your average House campaign. And you see a similar trend in the Senate campaigns, where, even adjusted for inflation, the cost of your average Senate campaign has increased by 50%. Now, this also does not capture all of the outside money, things like super PACs and whatever else."
Social Studies,"If you fast-forward to 2016, your average Senate campaign costs a little over 10 million dollars. But there's about that much money, approximately 10 million dollars, that also comes in from things like super PACs. And so it's totalling near 20 million dollars for a Senate campaign, on average. And so particularly competitive campaigns can be a lot more than even that. And if you wanna talk about really big money, you just have to look at presidential campaigns."
Social Studies,"So this right over here is the last presidential campaign, in 2016. And you can see that Hillary Clinton's candidate committee money was over half a billion dollars. She actually had a good bit more than Donald Trump. And she had a good bit more outside money. But the entire Hillary Clinton campaign had a nearly 800 million dollar budget. And if you combine Hillary Clinton plus Donald Trump, you have a total of 1.2 billion dollars for the 2016 campaign. In 1980, the total was 92 million."
Social Studies,"So, more than a 12-fold increase. And even if you were to adjust for inflation, which these numbers are not, but even if you did, you would see a several-fold increase in the cost of a campaign. So when you look at these types of numbers, there's a couple of interesting questions that come up. One is, what is the money for? Money for what? Well, there's many answers to that."
Social Studies,"One is, is that, especially in a presidential campaign, and to a lesser degree in a congressional campaign, the campaigns have to pay professional, full-time staffers. So campaign, campaign staff."
Social Studies,"You'll often have a lot of volunteers, but for example, Hillary Clinton, in 2016, had approximately 4200 people on payroll, where about 800 people were working directly for her campaign, another 400 with the Democratic National Committee, and roughly 3000 people with state Democratic parties in the battleground states. And beyond, on the staff, you also might have paid political consultants. Now, what do all these people do? Well, they come up with a campaign strategy."
Social Studies,"Some of them will do polling, to understand the sentiment in the larger population on specific issues or on the candidate. And they will do a lot of campaign advertising and marketing. Advertising. And so the staff will think about, well, what kind of advertising do we need to do? And then a large chunk of the money actually goes to the advertising itself. Advertising. Especially in mass media, if we're thinking about radio and television."
Social Studies,"Now, an interesting question is, given that in the 2016 campaign Hillary Clinton outspent Donald Trump by so much, how was he able to actually win that campaign? Well, there's several possible explanations to that. One is, is that Donald Trump was very effective at getting himself attention that he didn't have to spend money for. On top of that, a trend that has emerged really since the 2008 Obama campaign is the increasing use of social media in campaigns."
Social Studies,"Before social media became a major player, most of that energy really was in mass media advertising. But now with social media, you could cater a message to specific groups. You could focus your message. You could activate your base more. And so more and more, social media, which is currently a lot less expensive than, say, TV advertising, is becoming a bigger and bigger part of campaigns. Now, a last answer to the question of why so much money is that you have long campaigns in the United States."
Social Studies,"In some countries, the campaigns might be anywhere from two to six weeks. In the United States, the formal campaign, if you think about the first primaries, it's in February of an election year in a presidential cycle, and then the election is in November. So you're looking at roughly nine to 10 months from the first primary and caucuses to the election. But well before the first caucus, you're going to have the various candidates raising money and trying to get name recognition."
Social Studies,"And so the actual campaign and money raising, for a lot of these candidates, might be closer to two years. And so you can imagine, if you're spending two years with consultants, trying to do advertising, just so you have a showing in some of those first caucuses and primaries, well, that's going to cost you a lot of money. Now, it's for you to think about whether these are good or bad things. Many people would argue that having such a long election cycle doesn't allow a lot of focus on other things."
Social Studies,"Especially if someone's the incumbent, if they are campaigning the whole time, can they even govern? And then another argument against all of this money is it might put too much influence in the hands of people who can give money. I'll let you think about that.."
Social Studies,"You have individuals who besides being voters, can also be donors. And then you have organizations. It could be corporations, it could be interest groups, it could be labor unions. And then last but not least, we have these two boxes where you see PAC 1 and PAC 2. The obvious question is, what is a PAC? Well it stands for political action committee, and they've been around for decades."
Social Studies,"A simple way to think about is it's a way to pool resources which then can be donated to other parties to influence an election. But how can the money actually flow? Well as you can see, it can flow in many, many, many different ways. And to help us understand this, I'm gonna introduce some terminology that you might've heard before. There is hard money."
Social Studies,"Hard money is money that is actually regulated by the Federal Election Committee, and there are caps in terms of how much people can donate to various parties. In general, any donation to a candidate's campaign is considered hard money. That would be hard money there coming from the individuals. This would be hard money right over here coming from that PAC which has pooled a bunch of money. This would be hard money right over here coming from that PAC to Donald Trump's campaign."
Social Studies,"This would be hard money coming from the Democratic party to Hillary Clinton's campaign, or from the Republican party to Donald Trump's campaign. If there's something called hard money, perhaps there's also something called soft money, and you would be correct. There is something called soft money. A simple definition for soft money is it doesn't have the regulations that hard money does."
Social Studies,"An example of it would be let's say the Democratic party here, some of the money that they spend, so I'll just draw some of the money they spend, this part right over here. Maybe some of the money that the Republican party spends during the election, it's used for what's sometimes known as party building activities to get more people to join their party, or to advertise about certain issues. As long as it's done not in coordination with the candidate's campaigns, this is not going to have any limit."
Social Studies,"Some of the money that goes from an individual to a party, or some of the money that goes from a PAC to a party, can also be considered soft money if once again, if it keeps separate from coordinating with the candidate's actual campaign, and used for those party building activities. Now party building is a pretty broad definition. Soft money has been demonized a lot because people say well, it's just a way of getting around campaign finance regulations."
Social Studies,"Because even though it might not be directly coordinated with a candidate's campaign, it can influence an election in a pretty significant way. Now to further understand this diagram, you see these dotted lines between the corporations or the labor unions and these political action committees. What does that mean? Well a political action committee can be connected or sponsored by a corporation or a labor union, but it cannot receive funds directly from the treasury of that corporation or labor union."
Social Studies,"The corporation can sponsor it, can say hey, this is associated with us. If it's say, a labor union, it can go to its membership and say hey, I want you to donate to this PAC. If it's a corporation it can go to its management team and say hey, let's all donate to this PAC personally."
Social Studies,"Or it could go to its shareholders and say hey, why don't we all donate to this PAC? Because this PAC can donate money to the party or the candidate that might help influence the election in a way that might benefit us, or benefit the corporation. Now an attempt to limit soft money came in 2002, when you have the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, often known as McCain-Feingold, who are the two sponsors in the Senate. Among other things, it tried to limit this soft money."
Social Studies,"After this Act, even this party spending would have to be hard money. It would have to be subjected to the caps when they are raising that money. It also made clear that corporations and labor unions couldn't participate in what's called election nearing activities, where they're spending money on say, issue-based ads with oftentimes, the intent of influencing the election, especially in the run up to the election. This was made explicitly illegal as well."
Social Studies,"This gets challenged in 2010 where you have this major case, Citizens United versus the Federal Election Committee. Citizens United was an organization that was releasing a movie called Hillary the Movie during the 2008 election. This was a movie that was pretty negative on Hillary Clinton. The argument of the government was that hey, even though this looks like a movie, it's really political advertising."
Social Studies,"It's electioneering as we go into the run up to an election, and so Citizens United, which is a nonprofit corporation should not be able to do this. But the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United's favor. They said, as long as they are not coordinating with the actual candidate's campaigns, they are allowed based on the notion of free speech to directly participate in electioneering in the run up to an election."
Social Studies,"And to a large degree, the Citizens United ruling from 2010 really gutted the strength of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. That Act was trying to curtail soft money, that for the most part, was going through parties. But now post-Citizens United, on both sides, folks started to say gee, I could start an organization that pools money. Let's call that a PAC. But I'm gonna keep it independent."
Social Studies,"It's not gonna coordinate in any other way with the elections of the individual candidates, and so this is often referred to technically as an independent expenditure PAC. Here, post-Citizens United, I can get unlimited funding from corporations, or from individuals that is not regulated in terms of spending caps. And now I can spend an unlimited amount of money on electioneering to try to influence the campaign."
Social Studies,"Because of the power of these types of independent expenditure PACs, they have been termed Super PACs. Now the key difference between a Super PAC and a regular PAC is that the regular PACs that we talked about have limitations in terms of how much money people can donate to them. They actually even can't take direct money from the treasuries of a corporation or a labor union. They also had limitations in terms of how much they could donate to an individual campaign. But they could donate to a campaign."
Social Studies,"A Super PAC, on the other hand, can take unlimited amounts of funds from individuals, from other PACs, and it could actually take money from corporate treasuries themselves. As long as they are independent of the candidates' campaigns, they don't coordinate with them, they can spend as much money as they would like."
Social Studies,"So as always, it's really interesting to think about what is going to be the eventual repercussions of Citizens United versus FEC? We've already seen in the 2016 elections money approaching a billion dollars in terms of Super PAC money. What is the influence it has on the democracy? But a lot of folks might immediately demonize the Super PAC and said say, money was already in politics and this is just making it worse."
Social Studies,Where now you have corporations that are essentially being able to directly contribute large amounts of money. We've always had issues with foreign nationals contributing to our elections. We've always tried to prevent that. But a corporation can have ownership from around the world even if it's a United States-based corporation.
Social Studies,"How do you prevent foreign interest from showing up through this money? But on the other hand, I encourage you to read the Supreme Court's rulings because they had some very strong arguments in terms of a slippery slope."
Social Studies,"If you don't allow Citizens United to publish a movie, saying that it's electioneering, at what point what is something a political organization, or a media organization? And the Supreme Court found it very difficult to regulate Citizens United without going down a slippery slope where they would have to regulate a whole set of corporations and media. I'll let you think about it, but these questions are quite interesting.."
Social Studies,"So, we're here to talk about what seems like a very important Supreme Court case, Citizens United versus Federal Election Commission in 2010."
Social Studies,"Could you give a little bit of background on what got us to this Supreme Court decision? - [Rick] Well, the federal government, specifically Congress, gets to pass laws that regulate the financing of federal elections, and then, for state and local elections, that would be an issue for each state, and so, Congress, going back more than a century, has passed laws limiting the amount of money, kinds of money that can be raised, what has to be disclosed, they passed a whole bunch of laws, and these laws are sometimes challenged as being unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"The usual challenge is that the law violates part of the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and association, and the specific issue in the Citizens United case had to do with the First Amendment rights of corporations to spend money to support or oppose candidates for federal office. - [Bradley] Well, it is an important case, but it is a widely misunderstood case. The case, for example, is not about the question of whether, quote, corporations are people. We sometimes hear that."
Social Studies,"Not a single justice on the court, in any of the opinions, addresses that issue, because it's a longstanding doctrine of corporate personhood that corporations have certain rights that people have when they join together to associate. The case is not about the question of whether money equals speech. The court has long held, not that money is speech, but that you can't try to limit an activity which would be protected under the Constitution, like speech, by limiting money."
Social Studies,"For example, you could not say it shall be illegal to spend any money in the United States to publish a book or to pay an author or to operate a bookstore, right? - [Rick] So, if you were, say, General Motors or Google, and you wanted to put an ad online or on TV or in a newspaper that says support President Smith for reelection, that would be illegal if it was paid for with money from the corporation."
Social Studies,"Corporations could still participate, but they'd have to set up a separate committee, called a political action committee or a PAC, and they could only solicit certain people to put money into that pack, and they couldn't take money that they made from selling cars or software or something like that and use it for political purposes, and in Citizens United, reversing some earlier cases, the Supreme Court said that corporations, like individuals, have a First Amendment right to spend, independently, supporting or opposing candidates for office, and that it would be unconstitutional to limit this because it would be too much of an infringement on the speech rights of corporations."
Social Studies,"- [Bradley] It's about what rights people have to engage in speech when they have chosen to organize as a corporation, so the court makes the holding that corporations and unions have constitutional protection under the First Amendment when they make independent expenditures to advocate for the election or defeat of candidates, and by independent expenditures, we don't say that they can contribute money directly to candidate campaigns, but they are free to spend their own money to communicate with the public at large, and say we think you should vote for this candidate or against this candidate for these reasons, and that, I think, in a nutshell, is what the case is about at that highest level."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So, just to get a little bit more into the case, it's really all around this Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, the McCain-Feingold Act of 2002. What was all that about, and then how did that lead, eventually, to this Supreme Court decision of Citizens United versus Federal Election Commission? - [Bradley] Well, in some ways, it goes back much further than the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act."
Social Studies,"We should note that Congress, in 1907, passed the first federal statute that limited corporate contributions to campaigns, right? But corporations quickly found out, well, we can just do expenditures. We don't contribute to the campaign. We just spend our own money, but within this framework, both corporations and unions could do a lot of things."
Social Studies,"For example, they could run ads that said things like, you know, Congressman Jones is a no-good, anti worker, worker line person who wants to destroy American industry. Call Congressman Jones and tell him we don't need his agenda in Washington, and that didn't count as a campaign expenditure, because it didn't specifically urge people to vote for or against a candidate. - [Rick] So, President Bush signed a law, President George W."
Social Studies,"Bush, signed a law called the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, and this was in 2002, I believe it was, and it's commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Law, because those are the two big Senate sponsors, and the National Rifle Association, Senator McConnell, a bunch of people sued and argued it was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"While the case was going through the courts, the National Rifle Association, which definitely has a political point of view, set up a satellite radio station called NRA News, and they said oh, well, if news organizations can engage in this unlimited kind of electoral activity, we'll just make ourselves a news organization, and many people thought this was going to be a kind of sham way of just running political ads all the time."
Social Studies,"Well, what happened was that the NRA News actually started having news programs, opinion programs, call-in programs, not just on the election, but on issues that would matter to people who were sympathetic to the NRA, and it actually became a bonafide news organization."
Social Studies,"- [Bradley] So, the McCain-Feingold Law, or the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, as it's officially known, attempted to close this alleged or perceived loophole by saying okay, a corporation or a union can't even mention a candidate in a broadcast ad within 60 days of a general election, or within 30 days of a primary election. So, enter a group called Citizens United."
Social Studies,"- [Rick] Citizens United is an ideological group that is doing political activities, still around, and they had made a documentary called Hillary: The Movie. This was coming out at the time, not of the past election that we just had, but back in 2008, in that period when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were going to be competing for the Democratic nomination to be President, in the 2008 period, and Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation. That is, they're not selling shoes."
Social Studies,"They're just using the corporate form to be able to engage in associational activity, and there had already been a rule, well before the Supreme Court had established, which said if you're an ideological corporation, and you don't take money from for-profit companies, you can already spend whatever money you have in your treasury on political ads and political activity, but Citizens United deliberately took money from for-profit corporations, and they did it because they were trying to set up a test case."
Social Studies,"What they wanted to do was to take this documentary they had made, Hillary: The Movie, which said very negative things about Hillary Clinton, and they wanted to pay Comcast Cable a million dollars to make this movie available as a video on demand, which anyone could watch by choosing it from, you know, their cable guide."
Social Studies,"They'd be able to watch it, and under the federal statute, the Federal Election Commission said this looks like it's going to be on television, broadcast in a period close to the election, and it's going to feature the name Hillary Clinton, who's a candidate for President, and that would make it an election ad. It cannot be paid for by corporate funds."
Social Studies,"There were lots of ways that the Supreme Court could have gone, aside from overturning earlier cases, but the court was bold here, and on a five to four vote, the liberals on the court against the conservatives, the conservatives won, and the longstanding federal prohibition on corporations and labor unions as well spending money in federal elections fell. - [Sal] So, just as kind of a lay citizen, you know, on the face of it, I understand why there's all of this Congressional legislation."
Social Studies,"You're afraid of undue influence from corporations, but you know, we were able to talk to a few experts who, I think, took a more sympathetic view to the Supreme Court ruling, and their point was Citizens United was this organization."
Social Studies,"It definitely had an ideological point of view, and it was making this content that was clearly anti-Hillary Clinton, but there's many organizations, media organizations, you know, I think we could point to news channels, websites, which most people would consider to be news organizations or media organizations, that do definitely lean one way or the other, left or right, and they're arguing that the reason why the Supreme Court had to rule this way is if what Citizens United wasn't allowed, then whether you're talking about an MSNBC or a FOX News, that that would start putting them under scrutiny."
Social Studies,"- [Rick] Well, the law that limited what corporations can do created an exemption for press organizations that were engaged in journalistic kinds of activities, and indeed, the majority on the courts said we have to treat them the same. - [Bradley] The justices expressed real concern about the nature of the government's argument."
Social Studies,"They said, you know, you're saying you can limit broadcast ads, but what about internet? Could you limit communications about candidates over the internet? And the government attorneys eventually said yes, we can."
Social Studies,"We can limit anything that involves a corporation speaking about a candidate for office, whether it's on the internet or whatever, and by the time the oral argument was over, the government had asserted that it would have the right, for example, to limit the publication of a book that included one line of advocacy urging people to vote for a candidate at the very end of a long, you know, 500 page book."
Social Studies,"They had suggested that they could prohibit a union from publishing a pamphlet that advocated the election of a candidate. You could envision, you know, a candidate, something like why working Americans should support, you know, Hillary Clinton for President, or something like that. They had suggested that books over Kindle could be banned under existing law, and so, the Supreme Court said alright, this is very problematic to us."
Social Studies,"They scheduled it for a second oral argument, heard the case again, and at the end of the case, said we don't think that this is right, at least a majority did, said you cannot limit the speech of a group of people or a body simply because it is incorporated. - [Rick] But there was an argument of the dissenters that said the press is different."
Social Studies,"The press serves an educational and informative function, which is different than the function of other corporations, and it's permissible, maybe in part because the Constitution does provide separate protection for the press. There was a big debate about what that means, to carve this out. Now, that does create an inconsistency."
Social Studies,"We'd be saying we're gonna treat Google one way and FOX News and The New York Times another, but the current law is also inconsistent, so let me give you an example from the other side, which is think is very hard for those who support Citizens United to answer. In a case that came a couple of years after Citizens United, there was a guy who was a Canadian law student, then he became a lawyer in New York."
Social Studies,"He went to Harvard Law School, worked in New York, and he was here on a work visa, and he wanted to, according to his complaint that he filed, he wanted to go to Kinko's and make flyers, spend 50 cents making flyers, saying re-elect President Obama, and he wanted to hand those flyers out in Central Park. Well, because he was not a citizen, even though he's in the United States and has other kinds of First Amendment rights, even though he's not a citizen, he would violate federal law."
Social Studies,"He could go to jail for years, face a $10,000 fine, if he hands that piece of paper to one person, because then he'd be engaging in election-related activity as a non-citizen, and this case went up and the Supreme Court had a chance to explain why, as in Citizens United, if the identity of the speaker doesn't matter in the First Amendment, really, it's always about more speech all the time in elections, why is it that this guy, Benjamin Blumen, could be shut up? And the Supreme Court didn't even hear the case."
Social Studies,"It came up on a special kind of appeal from a three-judge court, which means that, when the court declined to hear the case, it agreed that the lower court was right, that this law is constitutional."
Social Studies,"So, we now have this new anomaly, which is that we say that non-human entities, these corporations that only exist because the state allows it to create this fake thing, non-human entities have these First Amendment rights, but yet a human being who was living in New York who wanted to spend 50 cents, he couldn't do that, and so, what's the difference, if it's really true that the identity of the speaker doesn't matter, which the Supreme Court said to Citizens United? Well, certainly, the identity of the speaker matters when that speaker is a foreign individual, or a foreign government, or a foreign corporation."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So, it seems like the majority opinion, they're not saying that large corporations being able to funnel tens or hundreds of millions of dollars for or against a campaign, independently of the candidate, that that won't necessarily corrupt, but it's more of by trying to regulate it in the way that the McCain-Feingold Act does, it actually has far-reaching consequences, or trying to regulate it in the way that the Federal Election Commission was trying to regulate it with Citizens United, it has far-reaching consequences that touch on just general free speech issues, like what you just talked about, you know, a sentence in a book that happens to be published or sold during the election, or a movie made by a random filmmaker."
Social Studies,"- [Bradley] I think, for one thing, for example, a lot of people, again, they resent to say that corporations aren't people, but they don't realize corporations have always, again, had some of these rights, acted as corporations, and acted in the political arena in a variety of ways, and I think that what these people should ask themselves is, well, if Exxon were not incorporated, would they go oh, well, Exxon's not incorporated."
Social Studies,"Well, that's fine, let them spend all the money they want, right? And conversely, I find most of these people, if you say, well, should we be able to censor The New York Times? It's a corporation? They say well, no, no, no, not that, and when you see that, I think it makes people realize the question is not really whether it's a corporation speaking or not. The question is whether or not we think the First Amendment protects the expenditure of money."
Social Studies,"- [Rick] We actually had to have rules before Citizens United to differentiate, because, actually, this was the law, that Google and General Motors could not spend their funds directly on election speech, but The New York Times and FOX News could, and so we had tests, and the Federal Election Commission had tests, and there are just some disagreements about how to best do it."
Social Studies,"I would point to the work of Professor Sonja West at the University of Georgia, who has written extensively on this, and she said the test should be people who are regularly engaged in journalism. That doesn't mean it has to be objective and you can't have a point of view. It doesn't mean there's a problem with FOX News or MSNBC, because they might have a point of view, but it means you're doing something other than electioneering."
Social Studies,"- [Bradley] I do think that, yes, that's what I'm saying, that these are some of the costs of having a vibrant, robust First Amendment, and if you want to give the government the power to regulate, you know, books to movies, you should think about who's the politician you most hate? Is it Hillary Clinton? Is it Donald Trump? Is it somebody else? Do you want them in charge of deciding who gets to speak out in politics and in what way and in what fashion and what manner? And I think you should think about it in those terms, and that sometimes makes people realize maybe it's best to let things go."
Social Studies,"Now, I would say, however, having said that, that a lot of the arguments about corporate influence are vastly overblown. There's quite a bit of debate, really, about whether or not corporations, in fact, benefit from spending money on politics. Big corporations, you know, the Fortune 500 types, what they really like to do is spend money on lobbying. That's much more direct. They can talk to candidates directly. They can let other people elect folks."
Social Studies,"There's almost certain to be some folks elected who they will like and they can go work with those people and craft messages and bills, and they can do this more behind the scenes, and that way, they don't have to offend any of their customers who don't like the party that they're supporting, but it's also clear that just spending money doesn't automatically win the elections. You can look at the last presidential election."
Social Studies,"I mean, Donald Trump spent, all totaled, about a quarter of what the Hillary Clinton forces spent. It certainly helps to have money, but in the end, it's not dispositive. What the money does is it's spent to try to inform voters, and those voters go out and vote at the polls."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So we've learned that, in Citizens United, the Supreme Court ruled that political spending by corporations, associations, and labor unions is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment, but whether or how the government can limit free speech in campaign contributions is still a matter of debate."
Social Studies,"As Rick Hasen notes, one test for the difference between the free speech rights accorded to journalists and those or corporations might be whether they are entities regularly engaged in journalism, but as Bradley Smith points out, allowing the government to impose limits on how people or corporations speak out in politics may lead to unintended consequences. To learn more about Citizens United, visit the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on U.S."
Social Studies,government and politics..
Social Studies,"Now, there's one pure view of the media and sometimes it's called the fourth estate where it has a central role in government, where the goal is to hold the government accountable, to inform the people, to have this pure objective view of what is going on with the government and bring it to the people and then help the people hold the government accountable, and also help the government know objectively what the people are thinking."
Social Studies,"And that is an idea that many in the media may strive for, but you have to think about, what are the incentives? What makes the media relevant and how do they exist? Most media outlets are for-profit organizations and so, let me make a few of these. Let's say that we have this one right over here. I'll call this media outlet one. Let me do this one right over here, let's call this media outlet two."
Social Studies,"As for-profit organizations, they need to get revenue so they can get their profit somehow, and for most of them, it comes through ad revenue. So, those ad dollars that are shown during the news or during a TV show."
Social Studies,"And so, you might guess that, hey, if I need to get ad revenue, advertisers aren't going to wanna show ads on a station that's not getting any viewership, so they're going to say, hey, how do we get maximum viewership? One argument might be, hey, we wanna be the most objective, high-quality news source, and that is a strategy that could be approached, or they could say, hey, maybe I could cater to certain belief systems, to, maybe, left-leaning folks or right-leaning folks."
Social Studies,"If you were to say that this is the distribution of people in our population right over here where people on this side lean left and then people on the right side right over here lean to the right, and these are people in between, there absolutely is a strategy where maybe if you are this media outlet, you say, hey, I wanna be centrist. Maybe give equal time, equal views to either side and maybe I get that viewership."
Social Studies,"But you could also have a strategy, well, what if I wanna capture all of these folks? Well, what they might wanna hear is something that's more critical of the right, that reinforces their left beliefs and so I could cater to that. Similarly, you might have something on the right saying, I could capture all of this audience here by helping, to some degree, telling them what they want to hear, and maybe in some level, reinforcing their beliefs."
Social Studies,"But by doing that, I get a large audience and I'm able to sell a lot of ads. It's an interesting debate whether it is good or bad that you have these media outlets that might cater to certain ideologies, but even if they are, they're still performing the role on some level as a linkage institution."
Social Studies,"Because these folks are trying to cater and understand what their viewership wants, that is a signal to the government that, okay, at least the demographic that watches media station one, this is the kind of stuff they're thinking about. And the demographic that watches media station two, these are the things that they are thinking about. So, it does communicate, in some way, to government, but you could imagine, almost every media outlet is trying to market that they are that ideal objective."
Social Studies,"And here's an example of that where a media outlet is actually reporting on how non-objective other media outlets are in their opinion or perhaps in the opinion of their viewers. - Tonight, a fair and balanced examination of the mainstream media's bias with three glaring new examples. First up, Donald Trump is firing back at the Washington Post after learning the paper's devoted an army of 20 staffers to dig up dirt on every nook and cranny of his life."
Social Studies,"- [Instructor] Now, another dimension to appreciate how the media, as a linkage institution, might influence government, or frankly, might influence other linkage institutions like elections, is how they report on things. Remember, they're trying to get viewership because the viewership is what makes the advertisers wanna advertise on their media outlets, and so, to get viewership, one strategy is to make things really exciting. Make it look like a sports competition, make it look like a horse race."
Social Studies,"And you see this, especially during elections, that oftentimes the focus may not even be on the substance, it's really on who's leading at a given time. That can sometimes influence the election and give that person extra momentum regardless of what their actual positions are. And here is an example of that. - Hillary Clinton is extending her lead over Donald Trump in several national polls."
Social Studies,"CNN is releasing a brand new poll of polls, which is an average of the six last surveys and it shows Donald Trump trailing Hillary Clinton by 10 points, so how does he close that gap? - [News Anchor] Donald Trump's reached new heights in the latest Fox News poll. With 39% of Republicans nationwide, he's more than doubling Ted Cruz at 18. Marco Rubio and Ben Carson are virtually tied for third within the poll's margin of error."
Social Studies,"- [Instructor] So, the media, definitely a very important linkage institution in our society, but it's really interesting to think about the various incentives for it and how that might influence its actions as a linkage institution and how its motivations might even affect other linkage institutions like elections.."
Social Studies,"And this is actually a picture of the New York Tribune from 1864, and you see it doesn't look all that different from some of the newspapers today. And so you can imagine in the 18th and 19th century, newspapers were the most powerful way of getting views out. In fact, many of these historical documents that we study in American history like the Federalists Papers, these were published in newspapers in order to affect public opinion."
Social Studies,"But then as we start to enter into the 20th century, technology starts to give us more forms of mass communication and mass media that might affect political discourse. So this is a picture of folks listening to a radio broadcast in the early 20th century. And there would have been entertainment over these broadcasts, but there would also have been news. And so you can imagine that this affected people's views of politics. Politicians, leaders started to give speeches over radio."
Social Studies,"And as you get into the mid 20th century, TV becomes more and more pronounced of an influence on politics. This is a picture of Walter Cronkite, famous for being one of the most respected journalists in all of television and the first to broadcast a nightly news in the mid 20th century."
Social Studies,"Now, as you get to the late 20th century, not only did you have the major networks broadcasting news, but you start having the advent of cable news networks, so you start having a larger diversity of people who are giving news. And then as you get into the internet age, it explodes. You have blogs and news websites that start more and more to cater to specific views."
Social Studies,"And then with the advent of social media, you have a way for leaders or people who influence other people's thought to directly influence or directly communicate with those that follow them, whether we're talking about Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram. And so an interesting question is how has this affected political discourse."
Social Studies,"How has this affected politics? So, many people would view this as a positive thing, that back in the day it took a lot of capital, it took a lot of resources to print and publish a newspaper, it took a lot of resources to nationally broadcast news, and so it was a limited number of groups that could get the views out, while as you have the internet and social media, anyone can communicate with anyone else."
Social Studies,"And so this would have increased the number of media choices and increased the number of points of views that are out there. Now, others would argue that, well, that might be good, but maybe there are negative consequences to it as well. In the days of Walter Cronkite, everyone was kind of operating with the same information."
Social Studies,"But with social media, more and more people fear that we're living in our own echo chambers, that we tend to follow people who already believe what we believe, that we tend to go to the media sites that reinforce our existing beliefs, and so it is polarizing. And it could also be polarizing because we have to think about the economics of media."
Social Studies,"Many of these media outlets are for-profit businesses, and so they have to think how do we get the maximum viewership, and that might be catering to what people already believe in or increasing the polarization, maybe demonizing the other side."
Social Studies,"Now, many people would also argue along with that increased polarization and with this increased diversity that more and more people are just doubtful of any news source, of any media source, and so they just become more skeptical and cynical of not just media, but the government as well. So it's an interesting phenomenon that we are living in as we speak."
Social Studies,"As much change as the newspaper or the radio or television broadcasts happened, we are now in this time of accelerating change where every few years it feels like there's a new medium coming out and it's interesting to see how that will continue to evolve and affect our political discourse.."
Social Studies,"And you had lawmakers who were supposed to be men of virtue as all men in those days would be leaking documents. Alexander Hamilton, the Treasury Secretary, and Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, would leak documents to their favorite papers in order to attack the other. And eventually George Washington had to come in and say knock it off fellas, because this isn't good for the country. So the bitterness carried out in the press was with us from the founding."
Social Studies,"What changed over time is that it became interestedly, newspaper particularly, to appeal to a larger audience. That means you didn't want just the left or the right. You wanted both. So that created a tradition, along with a few other things, where there was an attempt to give just the facts, a kind of middle of the road perspective."
Social Studies,"We are changing from that now, where the economics of covering the news and the digital change where you now can have anybody speaking and gaining access to the public has created a situation where you have a more partisan press now, and we're in the middle of trying to figure out where that's going next."
Social Studies,"- This is interesting because a lot of people when they talk about well, not it's getting polarized and partisan, the good ol' days when you got the truth, the wisdom from Walter Cronkite or whoever, but what you're really talking about is maybe what's going on now is a little bit of a reversion back to where we started. - That's right."
Social Studies,"In terms of the partisanship of the press it is a reversion towards the early days of America, and in terms of the partisanship of the individual members of Congress or of the White House. What is a little bit different is that the call to virtue, which would snap people out of their partisanship, is still up for grabs."
Social Studies,"The founders, when they fought like cats and dogs during the early years of the administrations, Thomas Jefferson was best friends with John Adams, and essentially then hired a newspaper writer to undermine Adams when he was president. I mean, this was a very dirty pool. The argument they were making was our country is new, and what is at stake is the very survival of the American experiment. So they were fighting for real stakes. They weren't just trying to primarily keep power."
Social Studies,"They were really trying to make this flower bloom that they had just planted. So now the question is what role does virtue play in the American experience to pull people away from their partisanship? To make them work together for common interests? And what is that shared area of common interest? What pulls them away from, what the founders knew, people would behave like dogs sometimes, but they thought they could pull away if they thought about the common interest."
Social Studies,"Well, is that pull still there? - So there's a lot of talk these days about polarization of the media or polarization of politics in general. How much of it do you think is due to things like social media, or do you think it was inevitable? - We've always had polarization in American politics, but there was a dose of something else, which was a call to a higher American ideal. And also voters would vote on people based on their virtue, on their larger than life statesmanship, which was not partisan."
Social Studies,"So you had to keep a balance. If you were being highly partisan, you kinda did it in quiet. What's changed now with social media and also with the flood of money in politics is that it has encouraged people to be more and more partisan. The louder and hotter I talk on a specific issue the more money I'm gonna be able to raise, the more interest groups are gonna like me, and the more clicks I'm gonna get because I'm the one making the most flamboyant noise."
Social Studies,"The problem is that means the arguments are always containing flamboyant noise. And the people who want a calm steady measured conversation, well, they're not getting read on social media. They're not in charge of the interest groups that pay millions and millions of dollars. So the system encourages people to stay apart, and that's one of the biggest challenges Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, says it may be the greatest threat to American democracy, that polarization."
Social Studies,"- Do you see a way of this getting resolved? Or does it get worse? Does it get better? - There have been periods of American history where we have been this split. Obviously the Civil War was a period of great rending in the American fabric. What changed it was an actual conflict. So that, God forbid, would be one way to do it. Another would be if there was a threat to America from outside its borders and people would feel an acute sense of national pride and patriotism."
Social Studies,"But other than that there doesn't appear to be at the moment a quick fix for what is a complicated problem for why the two parties have gotten into a inescapable fight that they can't seem to get themselves out of. - It's like we need a shock to remind ourselves how much commonality there is so all of the polarizing quibbling goes away, or at least gets covered up a little bit."
Social Studies,"- Big changes in American history usually happen from a shock and it's what breaks people out of their behavior, and also which tells a lot of the people in the rest of the country who don't participate in presidential elections and don't participate in congressional elections, it reminds them that something real is at stake. And there is a vast group of Americans who really want solutions in the middle, who don't care about the bickering and the ideology. But a lot of them don't participate in politics."
Social Studies,And so the kind of shock that would make people behave who are partisans is also the kind of shock that would draw in people who are just apathetic and not participating in the political system..
Social Studies,"And you're gonna see a series of videos on Kahn Academy tapping into John's expertise. - You know, when I cover the news every single day, one of the first things I do is I go back and look at our amazing American history for two reasons. One, what has the standard been in the past? How have people behaved in the past? So we know whether what's happening now is new, crazy, interesting, in keeping with the American experience."
Social Studies,"And the other thing is when you learn about history, when you look to the past, you can sometimes have a clue about what's gonna happen in the future. Even though things are much different now with technology and the pace of things, turns out, human beings behave the same way in a lot of ways all throughout American history. - So this is gonna be a very exciting, as you could tell, series of videos that some of 'em are gonna be John and myself."
Social Studies,"And some of 'em are gonna be John, giving us kind of connecting what you learn in school to what's happening in the world around us.."
Social Studies,"The characters in American history, all the way through, are fascinating, just, human beings. They would make great movie characters, period: heroes, villains, people who rise to courage when they were otherwise pretty boring people. Look at Abraham Lincoln, for example. He failed miserably repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly. Then he becomes the greatest President."
Social Studies,"And when he's almost at the end of his, well, he doesn't know it's the end of his life, but later in life, after he's had his greatness, he says, ""I confess that I was like a cork in a stream."" Well, if you're a regular person and you think, ""My life feels kinda without a purpose,"" you can think, well, the greatest President in America felt like his life was kind of bouncing around."
Social Studies,"And so, that is an incredibly human connection to greatness, and we all need connections to greatness of whatever kind to inspire us. Because the questions today that America faces about freedom and liberty and what it means to be an American, and how the power is distributed throughout our governments and our lives that affect us today were discussed and talked about and wrestled over all throughout American history. And it is a continuing experiment."
Social Studies,"And when Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, he said, ""This new country that we're creating ""has to constantly refresh, each new generation ""has to refresh their contact ""with the original ideals that the country was founded on."
Social Studies,"""Otherwise, the country will fail."" And so, it's not only important to know what's going on around us by studying history, but it is, according to Thomas Jefferson, your duty to stay engaged with the ideas of America so that those ideas don't get lost in the kind of flurry and craziness of a current moment.."
Social Studies,"If the president's party is not in control of Congress that means there are gonna be more investigations into the executive branch. And that's of course what the legislature is supposed to do but it means more investigations, it means that Congress might try and pass its own legislation and then work to some kind of accommodation with the president."
Social Studies,"Given the partisanship in America right now though, when you have the executive in the control of one party and the legislature in the control of another party, it also very well could mean complete gridlock and a situation in which many of the nations most important questions don't get answered.."
Social Studies,There are lots of local offices where laws are put on the book that really can affect your day-to-day life. There's also referendums in various states and localities. There are about 150-odd referendas on everything from whether marijuana should be legalized to whether and how poor people get medical coverage. Those are also on the ballet in a lot of places.
Social Studies,"And also, when a vote takes place for somebody who is being elected, it's not just for the policies of the day, it's also for the policies that may yet come. And if you have a view on the way things should be handled, you should exercise your voice because it not only, if you are in a place where your vote is not gonna matter in terms of directly electing the person you want, voting sends a message to those lawmakers. And it sends one of two kinds of messages."
Social Studies,"One, it says this number of people represents this viewpoint. And lawmakers should listen to that kind of message from the voters. A lot of times, even if they don't listen to it, well their opponents will be able to raise it and say, Look, this many people believe in this and you should. It is a fact that is then used in public debate. And that fact can sometimes be used to persuade people. Also, there's the case that lawmakers get nervous. And they want to get re-elected."
Social Studies,"And if they see a lot of people turning out on the other side, even if it doesn't keep them from being elected, well, the next time, it might keep them from being elected. So they have to listen. Finally, it's the spiritual, kind of American civic religion, which is America started on the idea that we could govern ourselves without resorting to fights. And we've been remarkably successful."
Social Studies,"Although American history is blotted, and it is broken in places, but Americans have always transferred power peacefully to each other, with the one great exception of the Civil War. But the electoral system still survived, even through that most bloody battle. And so as Americans, by voting, we are putting ourselves back in touch with this great original experiment, that at its time was unique in American history."
Social Studies,"And there are still people all across the world who fight and die for the simple ability to cast a vote so that their voice can be heard. And so not only to we have to keep faith with our own history, but also with the world in which it is a human right in some places to vote."
Social Studies,"And so we shouldn't take that kind of thing for granted, if we want a world in which human beings are allowed to voice their vote and have that vote mean something in the way the laws are made that determine how their lives are lived.."
Social Studies,"And so if they're interested in the president, well, they turn out for the presidential election. But in the off-year elections, in the midterms, well, the president's not really on the ballot even if some people tend to see the elections as a referendum on his presidency. So people turn out in lower numbers."
Social Studies,"We've also seen a trend, and it may be upturned in 2018, but a trend where Republican voters, who tend to be older, participate in the voting in midterm elections more than younger voters, who tend to vote Democratic, or voters of color, who vote for the Democratic Party as well. That's always been one of the challenges for Democrats, to get their team to turn out and vote in these midterm elections.."
Social Studies,"Now sometimes they lose a lot of seats and the entire control of the House switches from control in the president's party to control into the other party. In the Senate it's a little less direct. About 70% of the time, the president's party loses seats in a midterm election. And this is often seen, and more in more recent history, it's really seen as a kinda thumbs up or thumbs down vote on how the president is doing. The electorate reacting to whether they like or dislike what the president is doing."
Social Studies,"And in the two cases recently, where the president's party did pick up seats in Congress, it was in 1998 when the Republicans were seen to have overreached in their impeachment of Bill Clinton, and so voters voted for Democrats, Bill Clinton's party. And then in 2002 when George W."
Social Studies,"Bush was seen as successfully responding to the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and America, his party picked up seats in the Congressional election because it was seen as a ratification of his presidency so far.."
Social Studies,"And traditionally the Speaker of the House is the member picked by the majority party. Doesn't have to be from the majority party but that's always the way it's worked out and essentially everybody in the House gets together and whoever gets the most votes of the people voting. It's just the people voting, not necessarily the entire House. Whoever gets the most votes becomes the Speaker of the House.."
Social Studies,"The Speaker of the House though has prominence in that line of succession because the Speaker of the House is closest to the people and the formation of the federal government. Article one defines the powers of Congress because the framers wanted Congress really to be the powerful branch, close to the people. They were worried about a monarchy."
Social Studies,"So they didn't want the President to have excessive power and the Speaker of the House represents all of the, is elected by all of the members and so has a closer relationship to the people and that's what gives them power in the question of succession. What's interesting though is that there's only been one Speaker of the House who's then gone on to be President, James K. Polk."
Social Studies,"So while they are high up in the order of succession behind the Vice President, that doesn't necessarily make the job a stepping stone to actual power of the presidency through the electoral process.."
Social Studies,"What were the Articles of Confederation, and why did they need to get replaced? - Well, the Articles of Confederation were the first loose set of rules to govern these 13 states, but they were a mess. Essentially, they allowed the states to be kind of their own little sovereign islands. So, it was not a united nation. It was like an Archipelago of islands. And, the reason they were a mess. There's a couple of things."
Social Studies,"when they tried to repay the Revolutionary War soldiers, Congress and Washington with very little power, had to go to the states and say, please give us some money so we can repay the soldiers. A lot of the states said, no thank you. We're not going to do that."
Social Studies,"Then if you had a river that rolled through several different states, and you wanted to have a trade agreement with the Spanish, for example, to use that river and trade along it, then the government didn't have one way to negotiate with the Spanish. Individual states had to do it, and individual states had different interests. Some wanted to trade with the Spanish. Some didn't want to trade at all. And so, how do you get those states to agree on something? There was also not universal coinage."
Social Studies,"The states all made their own money and differently. Well, states might print a bunch of money in order to payoff some debts, and then the money in one state is worth less than the money in another, who regulates all of that? So, commerce, and industry, and self-defense. There was no way to raise an army an pay for it. So, the nation was crumbling before they got to Philadelphia in 1787."
Social Studies,"- And to your point, in most countries the parts of the country are called things like provinces, but ours are states, because they view themselves as individual countries. - Absolutely, and because of course, the Articles of Confederation had been formed in the wake of this fear, and the experience of the fear of a monarchy."
Social Studies,"So, they wanted personal liberty, and get the monarchy and national control, throw it all away, because they believe that once you consolidate control, in a national government of any kind, that it would trample liberty. And so, after having fought a revolution for the purposes of liberating the people, you're not gonna design a government that then stomps down on that liberty."
Social Studies,"So, they created something that gave the states lots of flexibility, and then that flexibility allowed everybody to go off in their different directions. - So, Articles of Confederation, maybe too much independence for the individual states. So, it seems like there was a consensus to fix it. What was the central debate when they decided to fix it? - Well, there was a consensus it had to be fixed, but when they got to Philadelphia."
Social Studies,"First of all, Rhode Island was invited and said no thank you, so 12 of the 13 states showed up. And, they knew they wanted to centralize things. But, what did that mean? And, did it mean one president, or a council of presidents? Did it mean a strong Congress? How strong? Could they tell states what to do? Well, if they did that then they were acting just like George III had acted."
Social Studies,"So, they had to iron out all of these issues to bring enough central control, and enough quick movement of government, that it could address national problems, but not so much that it trampled and stomped on that liberty. And, that was the constant debate. Constantly trying to figure out how to keep the balance between giving enough national power, but enough liberty. And that, some of the biggest fights included fights over slavery, North versus South, fights over big states versus small states."
Social Studies,"Who has representation in this national government, and how do you figure that out? And then of course, the question of do we want a president? Will it be a single person, and how the dickens do we elect that person? Which led us to the Electoral College, which has had some bumpy history. - And, where do you think we ended up? If on a scale of zero to 10. If was zero was a complete, you know, independent states, and 10 is a federal government that just controls everything."
Social Studies,"Where do you think the US Constitution ended up relative to the Articles of Confederation? - Well, in September of 1787, when it gets September 17th, 1787. When the new Constitution gets voted on, it is a stronger national document that has basically three main parts. One, the people are at the heart and center of it. It is the people who are the representatives, or at the center of the republican government. The second thing is that the national government can tell states what to do in some instances."
Social Studies,"Those instances are circumscribed, but it can happen. The states have to fall in line. That was very new, and there is this thing called a presidency which is created. Single person, created really in the mold of George Washington."
Social Studies,"So, it is a nationalized government, but with a strong attention to this question of protecting liberty through a balance of power system, so that both the national government has checks and balances, and also the relationship between the federal government and the state government has a number of checks and balances."
Social Studies,"So, even though they went in a more centralized direction, they were constantly attentive to this idea of liberty, keeping it free in the states, and not messing with them too much in their effort to get some kind of centralized control. - So, it sounds like they might have gone from a one or a two with the Articles of Confederation, to maybe a seven? - Well, they went, I think they went from a one or two to maybe a five or a six, which has now moved. - Over time."
Social Studies,"- Over time, closer to maybe an eight or nine. - Fascinating.."
Social Studies,"You have the rise of oil and John Rockefeller and basically, this period, think of Rockefeller and Vanderbilt, as, and Carnegie and JP Morgan as powerful the way we think of presidents. Presidents during this period kind of were on the descent but the magnets of industry, railroad, oil, steel, those were all banking, those were the superheroes in America, and they led to this amazing growth in industrialization but then also huge disparities. No labor laws that we would be familiar with today."
Social Studies,"So you had this industrialization with people working in the industries who had no protections, child labor, working 22 hours a day, horrible health conditions. So this gurgling, booming America, but where there's great disparities between who's doing well and who's not. - And it was called Gilded because those who were doing well were living very well. - Right, Gilded as in a gilded frame, covered with cold which came from a novel by Mark Twain."
Social Studies,"And that's right, it takes on the caste of this extraordinary wealth. Rockefeller was the first billionaire in America, Vanderbilt built the biggest house, still the biggest house in America during this period. So the wealth was, people would make eight to $10 in a week, some of these tycoons were making eight to $10 in a minute. And so that kind of vast wealth, because you could only make so much wealth before, this is just mountains of wealth and then also, again, this great disparity."
Social Studies,"- And it seems like it came from, really, technology. Technology allowed all of this productivity, the railroads, steel, et cetera, et cetera, and then of course finance was able to get in there and help move capital more efficiently. What parallels do you see with our current age where technology seems to be doing something similar where we have all of these new industries, and new wealth, but some fear that it might be causing some inequality. - You have, yes, you have a couple of things."
Social Studies,"You have innovation in these very different industries, both innovation in the creation of things but then also innovations in the structures of business. Buying up small business, creating big conglomerates. Then using that leverage and power to then crowd out competitors for sure but then also raise prices because you're the only game in town."
Social Studies,"And you also have business practices that are not the sort of laissez-faire economic belief said essentially that in the economy it was like in the American system, which was let it operate. Don't get in the way, don't mess with it, because when it operates it runs the most efficiently for America. - In the end markets can be messy but they're gonna have the best outcome. - That's right. - Is the argument behind laissez-faire."
Social Studies,"- That's exactly right, and it got this wonderful assist from Charles Darwin who said, we can explain the growth of, or you can explain the species and we can explain our natural world with this theory about the competition among the species and this term survival of the fittest, social Darwinism, survival of the fittest, which some, and I certainly thought might've come from Darwin didn't, it came from Herbert Spencer who basically had an economic theory of the survival of the fittest and then it went this way."
Social Studies,"Some people have more talent than others and when they exercise their talent they do very well and that's the best thing for society. It believed that society was ever increasing, it didn't mean that every single person was increasing, but that if you followed survival of the fittest and the best people did the best then ultimately society will always be on an evolutionary plane of moving upward."
Social Studies,"And so that was the theory behind get out of the way of these big companies and big tycoons and they will do the best for America and so the reason that was important was A, it kept government out of the way, B, it kept religious, it created a religion, it was a secular religion of course, but it created a theory that said, wow that looks like what you're doing is totally self interested but there's this theory behind it and everybody will improve so okay, go ahead."
Social Studies,"- Yeah, that was the beginning of Gordon Gekko's famous greed is good. - Right, right, yeah. Yeah, greed is good, so the comparison to our current moment is you have huge disparity and technologies that are, to use a cliche of the day, disruptive that are completely changing the way everybody does business, changing when we think about the way in which Americans behave, that rapid sense of change, it's changing culture rapidly and it's making big winners and losers and those big disparities exist as well."
Social Studies,"- How did the Gilded Age play out? Were some of these forces moderated eventually, maybe around 1900, and do you think similar things might happen for us? - There were two big moderation in response to the Gilded Age. You had government came awake again and then you also had labor movements that came into formation, basically to slow down the growth and the rapacious demands of the Gilded Age. Politics during the Gilded Age kind of went, became an offshoot of the titans of industry."
Social Studies,"If you look at the presidency between 1876 and 1892 they're all one term presidents and none of them get more than 50% of the vote and basically what the presidents spend their time doing is using the spoil system, which is essentially putting people in jobs to pay off the local bosses who helped them get elected."
Social Studies,"So getting elected became a job of staying elected and that meant dolling out patronage, basically giving people jobs who were your friends so that they would go and vote for you because these elections were all very close and that's not getting a lot of work done for the people. Some of 'em, Rutherford B."
Social Studies,"Hayes tried these little efforts at civil service reform, which essentially meant putting people in jobs who could monitor the factories, make sure that people weren't getting abused or that health wasn't declining or that anything that a government might do that we think of today but his political patrons didn't want that. So that was all very hard to do."
Social Studies,"What happened on the worker's end is they realized, and the most famous moment was in 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire where a number of women working in a garment factory are, there's a fire and the bosses lock the doors and I think 40 some odd women die, mostly women, and it highlighted the labor issues but labor unions start to organize and there are huge clashes and strikes and consumer boycotts and those start to put some pressure on business to change their practices, at least in terms of worker hours and the kinds of things that we now would certainly take for granted."
Social Studies,- Fascinating. - It's an incredible period. - Yeah..
Social Studies,"And they realized that the first president, George Washington, and this is why he was so important, was a man of virtue and that he in his behavior would set the precedence for the next president after him. That means the job is basically handed off by tradition from president to president but that also-- - And the reason why they didn't know what a president should do is that there wasn't a notion of a, there wasn't a precedent for being a president. - That's right, they knew what they didn't want."
Social Studies,"They didn't want two things, they didn't want a king, they'd just gotten rid of one of those. They didn't want a king and they also didn't want somebody who's whipped around by mob rule. Those were the two things they were trying to get between. But, a president has a lot of room to move in between the two of them, and they thought we'll put it in the hands of a virtuous American."
Social Studies,"George Washington, a good first virtuous American, and that person, through their virtue and character, would stay in the right place. Would not become a king and would not give over to the mob, but it also meant that it relied on the character of the person in the presidency. And so, each president in subsequent years, has taken shape in the presidency both by what was determined by their predecessors, but also by what they could do in the job."
Social Studies,"And what's happened is, a job that started out very weak in the American system has now become one where some people think of all the entire of American government as the president. And that's not what the founders wanted. - But how does that evolve? 'Cause obviously the constitution talks about the powers of the president. So, how does it change so much over time? - What happened was, when they originally created the presidency there was a debate, and the debate was, we need somebody who can move quickly."
Social Studies,"We can't always be calling them in to Congress because, of course, when the America was started they used to take several months, or sometimes it would take weeks to get on a horse and get to Washington. So, we need an executive who can move quickly. Well, what happened was, in various wars, America needed to move quickly, and they needed one person to act on behalf of the entire Union. Well, there's only one person who can do that."
Social Studies,"But, as people wanted quick action they handed over more power to the president. Congress, which used to fight with the president a lot, during the Second World War and then on into our present day, has given up a lot of its power to the president. One of the key ones being the power to make war. Presidents can now go and make war. Well, that's not the original way it was arranged."
Social Studies,"And they've done it because there is a hunger in the country for quick action, but the problem and challenge of that is, if you invest somebody in with power to do things quickly in an emergency, they hold on to that power and they don't let it go, and that means that they start doing things when it's not an emergency, that is then not vetted by the American system."
Social Studies,"And that system has both the judiciary and the legislative which are meant to hold back a president who's trying to act too quickly and do too much. - Let's go on this notion of making war as an example. There's clear powers that Congress has to approve a war, has the power of the purse, So, how did this happen? They just do that as a ritual now? - Well, basically there are times and Congress tries and makes attempts to try to pull power back from the president."
Social Studies,"The only times they've been successful after the Second World War is really after Watergate. The view was that the president had gotten too powerful. That President Nixon, who left the office, had abused the office and so Congress tried to pull some power back, but again, political parties which are now very close to the president. It used to be that political parties were not so powerful."
Social Studies,"If I'm a Republican in Congress and I want my Republican president to do well, I'm gonna give him the power he wants because we're connected. In the old days, if the president in the office was my party, well that's nice, but I've got my own views and I'm in Congress, and I'm gonna do what I want."
Social Studies,"And so, essentially a lot of these powers that have gone to the president have been handed over to him, not with a ceremony, but just by a lack of a fight by members of Congress, in withdrawing from their traditional role as the founders wanted it as the key actor in American government. That's no longer case, in America today, the president is the key actor. - And then every time that happens the next president or the next several presidents, we allowed that to happen to that person."
Social Studies,"I should have that power as well. - That's exactly right. It's almost like the powers conveyed to the new president like the furniture in the Oval Office. And so, they think, well this chair's pretty comfortable. (Sal laughs) I'm not gonna get rid of that and sit in the old uncomfortable wooden chair. I want all the plush trappings. And here's another reason."
Social Studies,"American politics has created a situation, and television has made this so much worse, where people run for office promising the sun, the moon, and the stars. So, they say I can, Donald Trump, when he was running said I alone can fix it. That is not the way the country was originally founded. That one person could fix or unfix things. It was supposed to be a country with representatives of the entire country."
Social Studies,"But, politics has created a system where, whether it's a Republican or Democrat, they run by saying I can do anything. Well, that means when you get in the office you want those quick powers that allow you to keep those campaign promises, and those quick powers are only quick if Congress and the courts aren't in the way. So, politics and the way you run for office makes presidents want to have every possible power at their disposal.."
Social Studies,"And you had lawmakers who were supposed to be men of virtue as all men in those days would be leaking documents. Alexander Hamilton, the Treasury Secretary, and Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, would leak documents to their favorite papers in order to attack the other. And eventually George Washington had to come in and say knock it off fellas, because this isn't good for the country. So the bitterness carried out in the press was with us from the founding."
Social Studies,"What changed over time is that it became interestedly, newspaper particularly, to appeal to a larger audience. That means you didn't want just the left or the right. You wanted both. So that created a tradition, along with a few other things, where there was an attempt to give just the facts, a kind of middle of the road perspective."
Social Studies,"We are changing from that now, where the economics of covering the news and the digital change where you now can have anybody speaking and gaining access to the public has created a situation where you have a more partisan press now, and we're in the middle of trying to figure out where that's going next."
Social Studies,"- This is interesting because a lot of people when they talk about well, not it's getting polarized and partisan, the good ol' days when you got the truth, the wisdom from Walter Cronkite or whoever, but what you're really talking about is maybe what's going on now is a little bit of a reversion back to where we started. - That's right."
Social Studies,"In terms of the partisanship of the press it is a reversion towards the early days of America, and in terms of the partisanship of the individual members of Congress or of the White House. What is a little bit different is that the call to virtue, which would snap people out of their partisanship, is still up for grabs."
Social Studies,"The founders, when they fought like cats and dogs during the early years of the administrations, Thomas Jefferson was best friends with John Adams, and essentially then hired a newspaper writer to undermine Adams when he was president. I mean, this was a very dirty pool. The argument they were making was our country is new, and what is at stake is the very survival of the American experiment. So they were fighting for real stakes. They weren't just trying to primarily keep power."
Social Studies,"They were really trying to make this flower bloom that they had just planted. So now the question is what role does virtue play in the American experience to pull people away from their partisanship? To make them work together for common interests? And what is that shared area of common interest? What pulls them away from, what the founders knew, people would behave like dogs sometimes, but they thought they could pull away if they thought about the common interest."
Social Studies,"Well, is that pull still there? - So there's a lot of talk these days about polarization of the media or polarization of politics in general. How much of it do you think is due to things like social media, or do you think it was inevitable? - We've always had polarization in American politics, but there was a dose of something else, which was a call to a higher American ideal. And also voters would vote on people based on their virtue, on their larger than life statesmanship, which was not partisan."
Social Studies,"So you had to keep a balance. If you were being highly partisan, you kinda did it in quiet. What's changed now with social media and also with the flood of money in politics is that it has encouraged people to be more and more partisan. The louder and hotter I talk on a specific issue the more money I'm gonna be able to raise, the more interest groups are gonna like me, and the more clicks I'm gonna get because I'm the one making the most flamboyant noise."
Social Studies,"The problem is that means the arguments are always containing flamboyant noise. And the people who want a calm steady measured conversation, well, they're not getting read on social media. They're not in charge of the interest groups that pay millions and millions of dollars. So the system encourages people to stay apart, and that's one of the biggest challenges Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, says it may be the greatest threat to American democracy, that polarization."
Social Studies,"- Do you see a way of this getting resolved? Or does it get worse? Does it get better? - There have been periods of American history where we have been this split. Obviously the Civil War was a period of great rending in the American fabric. What changed it was an actual conflict. So that, God forbid, would be one way to do it. Another would be if there was a threat to America from outside its borders and people would feel an acute sense of national pride and patriotism."
Social Studies,"But other than that there doesn't appear to be at the moment a quick fix for what is a complicated problem for why the two parties have gotten into a inescapable fight that they can't seem to get themselves out of. - It's like we need a shock to remind ourselves how much commonality there is so all of the polarizing quibbling goes away, or at least gets covered up a little bit."
Social Studies,"- Big changes in American history usually happen from a shock and it's what breaks people out of their behavior, and also which tells a lot of the people in the rest of the country who don't participate in presidential elections and don't participate in congressional elections, it reminds them that something real is at stake. And there is a vast group of Americans who really want solutions in the middle, who don't care about the bickering and the ideology. But a lot of them don't participate in politics."
Social Studies,And so the kind of shock that would make people behave who are partisans is also the kind of shock that would draw in people who are just apathetic and not participating in the political system..
Social Studies,"What exactly was the outline for how the country is supposed to behave and are we staying within that outline and those series of ideals? It goes back to the very beginning ingredients of America. So, the court is a test always of whether what we're doing now is in keeping with what we were supposed to do at the founding of the country."
Social Studies,The reason it has become so important recently is that the court ends up doing a lot more than it was ever supposed to do because of weakness in the executive branch and the legislative branch and so a lot of people are now looking to the court to solve problems that should actually be handled by the people's representatives. The judges are not elected.
Social Studies,"They are in there for life at the Supreme Court through the process of the president with advice and consent by the Senate but they are not elected and this was supposed to be a republic in which the elected representatives were the ones making the laws. But we've shifted away from that and so the court is now making decisions that can affect people's lives and a generation and not be changed as easily as say a piece of legislation which can be vetoed, amended, superseded by another piece of legislation."
Social Studies,It's really permanent changes in the American life. - So my understanding is that the Supreme Court should be above politics. To what degree is that actually the case? - Well the Supreme Court had lots of... There have been times where the Supreme Court when Andrew Jackson was president he tried to use the Supreme Court to do what he wanted it to do and Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to change the functioning of the court because it kept knocking down all the things he wanted to do.
Social Studies,"We've had moments where there have been these spasms where presidents have tried to get the court to do what they wanted. But in general, it was the American tradition that the justices were supposed to be picked if they were of good character and if they were of sound legal mind. If they had views on the manners related to the Constitution that were sort of sound legally. But their politics weren't supposed to be so important."
Social Studies,"What has happened is like so much in modern American life is there has been an intertwining of politics and the legal profession so that now when presidents run for office they say, elect me so that I can put in our kinds of judges. Which means that the kind of judge you pick helps you with your voters and if your voters want a very specific kind of ideological judge, then the more ideological the judge that you pick, the greater your voters will be happy about you and that'll keep you in office."
Social Studies,"And that is true of the senators advising and consenting on these decisions and true of the presidents who pick them. Well that means that the people who go into the office into the Supreme Court I should say end up being more political than in the past. There was a period where when an American president would pick a justice, that justice very often would rule in a way that was totally the opposite of what the members of that president's party wanted."
Social Studies,"It happened repeatedly in American life and that was a symbol people thought of the idea that these issues before the court were being weighed on their merits and had nothing to do with the ideological views of the judge weighing them. Now, where you sit on a particular issue is often determined by where you came from politically.."
Social Studies,"Lots and lots of the Democrats he put his finger on and told his fellow Democrats, ""You vote for my man,"" and they lost. Other Democrats won and that gives you a sense of how the president, even a popular and successful one, was very separate from his own party."
Social Studies,"Well, what's happened since then is that presidents have started to have much more control over the members of their own party and voters, who in 1938, thought it was outrageous that a president would force Democrats of his own party to vote the way he wanted them to because they saw such a separation between the Presidency and the Congress. Those voters don't exist much any more. Voters now pay a, penalize, a member of a party who doesn't stick with their president of that same party."
Social Studies,"So that connectedness tends to create a situation in which congressional elections in the midterms tend to be a referendum on the president even though the president's not on the ballot. What's also the other big change in American politics is the amount of money. In 2018 it's very likely that according to the Center for Responsive Politics five billion dollars will be spent on the election. 10 years ago, in the election of 2008, spending was half that."
Social Studies,"2.5 billion dollars and that was a presidential year in which there's more spending. The enormous amount of money means you have more ads, you means you have a whole group of people who's job it is to make decisions that are subtle and complicated and complex seem easy and to intensify the partisan battles between each other."
Social Studies,"And that also creates a situation in which candidates are always running for office because they're always having to raise the money to pay for all of those ads, and all of those experts, and all of those social media campaigns."
Social Studies,"Speaking of social media, we now have an instance in which you have real time up or down votes from constituents and people on the sidelines telling members of Congress whether they're doing the right thing or doing the wrong thing, either in office or in elections, and that creates a real time jitteriness to elections. It used to be you could have a long time conversation."
Social Studies,"Heck when Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas debated in those famous Lincoln/Douglas debates for a Senate seat, those debates took place over three hours. Now we have situations where people will flame up for about 20 minutes on Twitter and that's all the time you'll ever see for something to get addressed because 10 more issues have come along in the next 20 minutes."
Social Studies,So social media has sped up and intensified the nature of conflict in campaigns and those are some of the big things that have changed in the way we run our congressional campaigns..
Social Studies,Then the job kind of got less powerful. There were periods during the Civil War where there wasn't a Speaker of the House for long periods because there was so much contention in the Congress they couldn't pick a Speaker of the House. The modern Speaker of the House has become increasingly powerful really growing with the growth of the federal government around let's say the second World War.
Social Studies,Various different Speakers gaining more power and in the recent incarnation the Speaker is particularly powerful in two different ways. One is shepherding a President's legislation if the Speaker is from the same party and the other is in opposition. They become essentially the opposition speaking against a President of an opposite party. So people like that would be Nancy Pelosi now with President Trump or John Boehner with President Obama or Tip O'Neill with President Reagan.
Social Studies,So they are the key person in doing combat with whoever's in the White House if they're from the opposite party..
Social Studies,"The government is actually the problem. This is the message of his inaugural address. And he broke with the idea that the federal government through the application of its resources, could help American life, which was a very stark ideological break with the way the American government had been going since the mid 40s."
Social Studies,"And then on foreign policy, his increased defense spending and his very strong position against the Soviet Union coupled with a willingness to actually negotiate with the Soviet Union, which got him a lot of grief from conservatives in his party, that both hard line and ability to negotiate helped usher in the end of the Cold War.."
Social Studies,"He was going to cut taxes, and what that was going to do was shrink the amount of available money towards government, which he was then going to also do by cutting spending, and he was going to cut regulation."
Social Studies,"So it was essentially paring down government, which he thought was inefficient towards giving resources to those who need it, he wanted a lot of that power to go back to the states, and he also believed in an economic program that both cut money from domestic spending but also cut taxes, which he believed would actually generate more revenue because of something called supply-side economics, and so his both economic theory and his theory about shrinking government were kind of matched up in his first budget and in his first major tax cut.."
Social Studies,"Now the challenge was that Reagan's defense spending and his tax cuts ballooned the deficit and what that ended up, what ended up happening is that the thing he had come to Washington to try to solve, which was the budget deficit had actually gotten bigger, and so Reagan, who came to town as a tax cutter ended up ultimately having to raise taxes to solve some of those problems of having a large deficit and why is that bad? Because deficits lead to inflation and inflation is what was strangling America when Reagan came into office."
Social Studies,"Inflation was very high and unemployment was high and so, his solution to it while it kicked off a strong economic recovery also ballooned the deficit which is a problem that is still one they wrestle with today.."
Social Studies,"Just get government out of the conversation. That has continued to bounce along in politics, there was the most major fight on those lines with Newt Gingrich and president Bill Clinton. Since then, there have been pockets of it, but the appetite for deficit reduction, for shrinking government in order to make sure that the bills are paid by government, has kind of gone out of favor in Washington."
Social Studies,"It was a very big deal during the '90s and during the first 10 years of this century, but it has not really been as much a part of the conversation in politics as it once was. It once dominated the way people talked about government. Now there are other things that are taking the conversation away.."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] It is very important. The entire theory of popular sovereignty is contained within these beautiful words, so we've got a lot to talk about. - [Sal] And before we even get into it, what do you mean by the theory of popular sovereignty? - [Jeff] So the preamble begins with the famous words, 'We the people of the United States,' and those signal that in the United States, power belongs to 'we the people.' It doesn't belong to our representatives in Congress."
Social Studies,"It doesn't even belong to the state governments. And that was a huge shift because an original draft of the Preamble read, 'We the people of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,' and so forth."
Social Studies,"But, James Wilson, who was the main drafter of the Preamble changed those words, and at some point, the Preamble was changed to the famous words we know now, 'We the people of the United States.' That meant that when some Southern states tried to secede from the Union, before the Civil War, arguing that they were sovereign as state governments, President Lincoln resisted their Constitutional ability to secede, saying that since 'we the people of the United States' had created the Constitution, a majority of 'we the people of the United States' would have to agree before any state could leave it."
Social Studies,"So, that's why it was a huge shift in a conception of power that James Wilson embodied in these words. Before the Preamble, people believed that legislatures were sovereign. In Britain, the king in Parliament was sovereign. But, in America, thanks to Wilson and his brilliant colleagues, 'we the people of the United States' as a whole became sovereign and that came to chart the entire course of Constitutional history."
Social Studies,"But then we have all of these purposes for which the Constitution was formed: to form a more perfect union, establish justice, domestic tranquility, common defense, general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. And then we're saying that's the reason we established the Constitution."
Social Studies,"There's lots to unpack there, but maybe we should focus on those final words: 'secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.' The framers believed that our rights come not from government, but from God or nature, that we're born with them, and when we move from the state of nature into civil society to form a government, we surrender temporary control over certain of those rights in order to secure the safety and security of the rights we've retained."
Social Studies,"So that means that certain rights are unalienable, to use Jefferson's language in the Declaration."
Social Studies,"We can't alienate them to government when we form government, and the purpose of alienating temporary control over certain rights, like allowing the government to punish murder, rather than, you know, having private violence, is to secure the blessings of liberty of the retained natural rights, the first of which the framers believed was complete freedom of conscience, the right to believe or not to believe according to the dictates of our conscience."
Social Studies,"So, we really see that that idea of securing the blessings of liberty is implicit in the idea that our rights come from God and not government, that government only has temporary control of them, and reinforces, once again, that we should never confuse the actions of the government, laws that Congress or the state governments pass, with the will of the people. 'We the people' are sovereign. The government is our servants."
Social Studies,"We are the principles, and when there's a clash between the will of the principles represented by the Constitution and the will of the servants represented by the legislatures, we prefer the principle to the agent. That was what Hamilton said in Federalist 78 in justifying the Supreme Court's power to strike down unconstitutional laws, because the Constitution ratified in the name of 'we the people' represents our views more profoundly than those of ordinary laws."
Social Studies,"That's why judges have to prefer the Constitution to ordinary laws. So, once again, we're seeing packed into this Preamble so much natural law theory and theory of popular sovereignty. There's one other really important notion contained in those words securing the blessings of liberty in the name of 'we the people,' and that's that the Constitution itself didn't get to speak for 'we the people' when it was proposed."
Social Studies,It wasn't until it was ratified by special conventions that had been elected for that purpose that it earned the right to speak in the name of 'we the people' as a whole.
Social Studies,"James Wilson was very keen on the idea that it was the ratifying conventions not the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia that gave the document its status as supreme law and that idea that only laws that go through a special procedure specified in the Constitution in Article V, which is the amendment procedure, or by special Constitutional Conventions, get to speak in the name of 'we the people,' is absolutely core to the whole theory of American Constitutionalism."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Why were the founding fathers so focused on this notion of popular sovereignty, of elected officials being servant to the people, and making it so strongly embedded even here in the Preamble? - [Jeff] They just fought a revolution based on the idea that the tyrannical King George had infringed the natural rights of the people, had refused to grant basic powers of representation, and had broken the social contract, and therefore, had lost the right to govern people because he was governing without consent."
Social Studies,"One of the natural rights that people believed were unalienable, retained by the people, was the right to alter and abolish government whenever it threatens the retained natural rights of the people. That's in the Declaration of Independence and, in the Constitution, it can be found in Article V. So, that right of revolution was part and parcel of the idea that our basic natural rights are retained. And you have to remember how revolutionary it was to be talking of popular sovereignty in 1787."
Social Studies,"There were almost no democratic self-governments on earth then. There had been small-scale democracies in Greek, Greece and Rome. In Athens, Solon, or in Sparta, Lycurgus, had been lawgivers, but no people had ever, as the scholar Akhil Amar says, voted on a written Constitution before, deliberated it, and had it ratified in their name."
Social Studies,"So, that's what was so radical about it, that even the handful of minor of the sort of partial democracies at the time, like the limited suffrage in the British Parliament or the Swiss Cantons hadn't had a written Constitution that was ratified by popular deliberation. So, that's what made it radical and that was Wilson's distinct contribution to America's entire theory of democratic self-governments, and that's why if you had to talk about the essence of Constitutionalism today, it's not populism."
Social Studies,"It's not a quick direct vote. It's not Brexit. It's not a referendum. It's long periods of deliberation, so the text earns the right to speak in the name of 'we the people,' and it was the very reason for which the revolutionaries fought the American Revolution. - [Sal] Fascinating. Let's continue. So, we say that we have 'We the People of the United States,' it establishes the popular sovereignty, and then it says, 'in order to,' and it lists a bunch of reasons why we are, what we are trying to do."
Social Studies,"We already did 'secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.' What are the other things we want to talk about? - [Jeff] Let's go back in order and the first purpose is 'in order to form a more perfect union.' Well, that was the central goal of the Constitutional Convention. The previous union, represented by the Articles of Confederation, had been imperfect. That was sovereign states that were unable to achieve common purposes. They couldn't raise money to support forces in war."
Social Studies,"They couldn't put down rebellions by debtors in Massachusetts, known as Shay's Rebellion. They needed a unanimous vote to achieve anything. And essentially, the government didn't work. So, the framers came to Philadelphia in order to form a more perfect union by establishing a Constitution strong enough to achieve common purposes, but restrained enough to protect, retain natural rights. That's what a perfect union is."
Social Studies,"It's not a consolidated government, because states retained powers under the 10th Amendment. All powers not vested in the United States as a whole are retained by the states or the people. And, ultimately, it's 'we the people' who retain the ultimate power, because we're the ones who are sovereign. But we can parcel that power out either to state governments or to the federal government in order to ensure the protections of liberty."
Social Studies,"So, that's what a more perfect union is and that's why it was so appropriate that Lincoln, in defending the Union during the Civil War, resisted the authority of the state governments to secede on the grounds that 'we the people of the United States' needed to consent before the Union could become less perfect. - [Sal] I just want to double-click on that a little bit because the words, 'more' and 'perfect' don't normally go together. You're either perfect or you're not."
Social Studies,"And so, part of the narrative that I think I'm hearing is that we had the Articles of Confederation, which were imperfect, and we want to get closer to being perfect. That's one of the reasons here. Many reasons when I look at, 'to form a more perfect union,' it also, at least to me, kind of invokes this notion of continuously trying to get better, even from the starting point. - [Jeff] You're right to parse it closely. We're trying continuously to get better, but perfection doesn't mean amalgamation."
Social Studies,"In other words, the most perfect union wouldn't be a total union in which all power is united in the federal government, for example, and not parceled out between the federal government and the states, and also not separated out so the various branches can check each other."
Social Studies,"We want a union perfect enough to achieve common purposes, but not so strong as to threaten liberty, and it was that delicate balance that was crucial to Madison's vision and that led to most of the tensions in the Constitution Convention. - [Sal] And then, 'establish justice?' - [Jeff] Well, my goodness. There's a lot packed into that, and you might think that that mandate to establish justice gives judges the power to do justice, regardless of, let the heaven's fall, to use the expression."
Social Studies,"But that's not what the Supreme Court has held. In a really interesting case, the Supreme Court, it was called Jacobson vs Massachusetts. It came down in 1905. The Supreme Court rejected the claim that the Preamble to the Constitution conferred independent powers that could be enforced by judges. In other words, it wasn't a general mandate that allowed judges to do justice regardless."
Social Studies,"Instead, Justice Harlan said in the Jacobson case, although the Preamble indicates the general purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution, it has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the government of the United States or any of its departments. Such power is embraced only those expressly granted in the body of the Constitution, or, and this is the final bit, and such as may be implied from those so granted."
Social Studies,"So, 'establish justice' is a broad declaration of purposes. Many parts of the Constitution help the government to establish justice, including the Bill of Rights, which requires that people can't be deprived of liberty without due process of law. If they are gonna have a criminal trial, they have all sorts of rights: to confront witnesses, to be tried by jury, and so forth. But, it's the specific articulation of the rights that allow us to establish justice that are the ones the judges can enforce."
Social Studies,"The broad goal is the one set out in the Preamble. - [Sal] And then we have 'insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare?' - Yes, so domestic tranquility is what some says of central concern to the framers. They're concerned about armed mobs like those I mentioned in Massachusetts in Shay's rebellion where debtors and farmers in western Massachusetts are rebelling against their creditors."
Social Studies,"So, they want to allow the government enough power to put down these insurrections, but they don't want a government so strong that it will create standing armies that can be permanent threats to liberty, the kind that King George's army was."
Social Studies,"So, that's why the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution wants to provide for well-regulated militias that can help ensure domestic tranquility, but doesn't want to empower a permanent standing army, because it believes that, ultimately, the people do have to retain the ability to take up arms to defend their own liberty if the government is threatening it as part of their unalienable right to alter and abolish government. So that's the domestic tranquility part."
Social Studies,"And then, the common defense, of course, is hugely important and Congress has the power to declare war. The President is Commander-in-Chief. The President has the power to repel sudden attacks, but otherwise it's supposed to be Congress in theory at least, that authorizes the deployment of troops abroad, and the parts of Article I for Congress and Article II for the President that give those two branches war-making powers, help to ensure that the Constitution provides for the common defense."
Social Studies,"The final clause, I hestitated to introduce because it's so incredibly broad, 'promote the general welfare,' wow. Well, I mean, that could be read as a kind of blank check for the government to do whatever it thinks is necessary to promote the general welfare. But, both the Supreme Court and also the framers, in ratifying the Constitution, made clear that the general welfare clause was not a blank check."
Social Studies,"It was that Congress and the President could only exercise the powers that were either explicitly granted by the Constitution or could be fairly implied by them. And yet, at the same time, Chief Justice John Marshall and others suggested that those powers have to be broadly construed enough to achieve the purposes of the Constitution, which include promoting the general welfare."
Social Studies,"So, you might say that promoting the general welfare is a different expression of the goal of promoting a more perfect union, except you could say that there's a separate goal of passing laws that are in the general welfare, again, without threatening liberty, and that clause, once again, embodies this tectonic balance between empowering government, but also protecting retained rights."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So, just to make sure that we got all of the big points, we've learned that, although the Preamble itself isn't a basis for justice, like the body of the Constitution, it establishes that 'we the people' are the source of political power in the United States. It explains that the Constitution would form a more perfect union between the states and the federal government than the weak Articles of Confederation, while ensuring that the people still retained their natural rights."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Preamble, which I encourage you to do, visit the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. Government and Politics.."
Social Studies,"Article I is jam packed with information about how our government is supposed to work, but principally what it does is create the Legislative Branch of government, which includes the House of Representatives, and the Senate, which together, comprise the Congress of the United States. Article I also tells us how people can get elected to those bodies, and what powers Congress has. To learn more about Article I, I talked to two Constitutional experts."
Social Studies,"Ilya Somin is a professor of law at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, whose research focuses on Constitutional law, property law, and the study of popular political participation. Professor Heather Gerken is the Dean of Yale Law School. She's a leading expert on Constitution law and election law, and her research focuses on Federalism, diversity, and dissent."
Social Studies,"- [Dean Gerken] Article I gives an enormous amount of power to the legislative branch, otherwise known as Congress, and it was designed specifically to overcome some of the problems that they'd seen under the Articles of Confederation. - [Professor Somin] The legislative power under the Articles of Confederation was pretty weak, in part because the Congress under the Confederate articles didn't have the authority to directly tax the states."
Social Studies,"They also lacked a lot of other powers that were eventually given to Congress under the Constitution. - [Dean Gerken] These were the things that really mattered if you're building a young nation. You need to be able to do certain things in order to protect it, especially at that time, when there were many, many other countries that were circling around wanting to grab the land and power. And so the United States needed to defend itself in those early days."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Okay, so we all know today that our Legislative Branch is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. But it didn't have to be that way, so why was it that the framers settled on this two house structure for the Legislative Branch? - [Professor Somin] I think for several reasons. One is that it was a compromise between the small states and the large states."
Social Studies,"The large states, ones that have a lot of population, wanted representation in Congress in accordance with population, obviously then the large states would get more representatives."
Social Studies,"The small states, on the other hand, were concerned that they would be dominated by the large states if that happened, so in the end, the compromise is you have one house, the House of Representatives, which is largely apportioned based on population, and one house, the Senate, which is apportioned based on each state having two votes, no matter how small or how large it is. A second reason why you end up with this structure is the influence of the British example."
Social Studies,"The British had both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. And the House of Commons, of course, being more subject to popular pressure, while the House of Lords were this elite aristocracy. And the founders also wanted a combination of popular and elite power. And it was thought that the Senate would fill that elite role, in part, because initially the senators were chosen by state legislatures, rather than by the voters directly."
Social Studies,"- [Dean Gerken] So the House of Representatives, which is based on districts, is supposed to represent you based on where you live, and the Senate, which is based on states, is supposed to allow, at that time, the state legislature to nominate two luminaries from the state to represent the state. - [Kim] So yeah, for a long time, the senators were actually appointed. Now they're elected."
Social Studies,"- [Dean Gerken] Senators were appointed until the passage of the 17th Amendment, which amended Article I, and that gave state legislatures a fair amount of influence over who went to the national government. - [Professor Somin] But it is also true that many states by that time already effectively had popular election of senators. - [Kim] Really interesting."
Social Studies,"Okay, so you described the Senate as being kind of the American version of the House of Lords, a little bit more elite, a little less subject to popular opinion. How does that carry over into the Senate that we have today? How are its powers different from the House of Representatives? - [Professor Somin] It does have certainly different powers from the House in some respects."
Social Studies,"For example, it has the power to ratify treaties and to confirm appointment to the the Court and to the president's cabinet, so earlier this year when Neil Gorsuch was appointed to the Supreme Court, he had to be confirmed by the Senate."
Social Studies,"Obviously today, the Senators are elected just like members of the House are, and I think they're every bit as partisan and almost as sensitive to public opinion as members of the House of Representatives, so the difference between the Senate and the House in that regard, maybe it hasn't completely disappeared, but it's certainly greatly diminished. - [Kim] Okay so there are certain powers that are reserved to the Senate."
Social Studies,"Are there particular powers that are reserved to the House of Representatives? - [Dean Gerken] The House is important. Don't underestimate the importance of the House. I'll just say the House of Representatives, for example, is allowed to initiate impeachment proceedings against the president. - [Professor Somin] If the House votes in favor of impeachment, then the Senate holds a trial to determine whether the official in question gets convicted or not."
Social Studies,"- [Dean Gerken] As a general matter, though, they're roughly co-equal. For the big, important things, like passing legislation, you need both of them to work together. - [Kim] So together these two houses make up Congress. So how is Congress different from the Executive Branch or the Judicial Branch? What are its powers? - [Dean Gerken] The way that the framers understood it was that each one would have their own job."
Social Studies,"So the judiciary, obviously, was there to judge disputes between people, to run the court system, et cetera. The executive was there to carry out the laws. And so the executive's job is to administer the law once it has been made. And of course the legislature is there to legislate. So its main job was to make the law. And at the time, I will just tell you, everyone thought that the big gorilla in the room was Congress, that it would be by far the most powerful organization."
Social Studies,"The framers simply did not anticipate how powerful both the judiciary and the president would become over time. - [Kim] So what happens if, for example, the Congress and the president don't get along? - [Professor Somin] Well, it happens quite a lot. The president could refuse to accept laws passed by Congress, he could veto them. In that event, Congress can only override it if two-thirds of both the House and the Senate voted to do so."
Social Studies,"Congress, on the other hand, can pressure the president in various ways. They can hold hearings investigating his conduct on various issues. They can de-fund agencies of the Executive Branch whose job performance they don't like. They can refuse to confirm the president's appointees to various offices, and in extreme cases, that have happened a couple of times in our history, Congress can even impeach the president, and if he gets convicted in the Senate, then he would be removed from office."
Social Studies,"This is what led to the resignation of Richard Nixon. The House of Representatives impeached him, and Nixon resigned before he could be tried in the Senate. President Andrew Johnson and President Bill Clinton were also both impeached, and in both cases, the Senate ultimately acquitted them, but it was still a very painful time for both of those presidents. - [Kim] So speaking of antagonistic relationships, I think one thing that's really come to dominate Congress is partisanship."
Social Studies,"To what extent did the Constitution anticipate this rise of parties and partisanship? - [Professor Somin] They actually knew about parties to some degree from their British experience, but they were very suspicious of them, and they hoped and perhaps expected that they wouldn't emerge in America to anything like the same extent that they had in Britain."
Social Studies,"But in actual fact, a few years after the adoption of the Constitution, we already had the first party system, the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans, and partisan alignments have played a big role in Congress ever since then. - [Dean Gerken] So even back then there were rival interpretations of how the Constitution should be carried out, and what kind of power the national government should wield."
Social Studies,"But they somehow thought, naively, I think, that the parties would disappear and that people would have allegiances to their state or to their region, but they wouldn't have allegiance to a party. That broke down completely almost immediately after the Constitution was written."
Social Studies,"That leads to a real problem these days, because most modern Constitutions recognize that there will be two parties, that they will be in competition with one another, and that part of the job of the Constitution is to regulate that competition."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Somin] Would the founders have done anything differently if they had known about parties and expected that they would play such a big role? It's hard to know for sure, but maybe they would have been less confident than some of them were that Congress would always stand up for its prerogatives against the president when the president and Congress are of the same party. I think often Congress is inclined to overlook various presidential abuses."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] If the reverse is true, things might be very difficult to do. - [Dean Gerken] Exactly. I mean the whole point about them needing one another to act is really a problem if one side is antagonistic to the other side. - [Kim] One other thing we see here in Article I, is talking about kind of what the Federal government does versus what the states do. So this is kind of the idea of Federalism, then."
Social Studies,"Could you tell us a little bit more, just about what Federalism is and how it's supposed to work? - [Dean Gerken] So the way that we understand Federalism back then, was that there was a division of labor. The states would regulate things that were inside their territories, and accorded to them in terms of responsibility, and the Federal government would regulate everything that was accorded to it under the Constitution."
Social Studies,"The problem is, as Congress' power became more and more expansive, it ended up regulating the same areas that the states regulate. - [Kim] So if the Federal government and the states have a law on the same topic, who wins? - [Dean Gerken] As long as it's passed properly by the Federal government, then the Federal government wins. So if there's a Federal law and the state law is inconsistent with it, the state law is displaced."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Is there anything that might surprise the framers about how our Congress operates today? - [Professor Somin] When the framers created Article I and drafted it, they certainly expected that Congress would have more power under the Constitution than it did under the Articles of Confederation, but I don't think very many of them would have believed that Congress would ever be able to do things like forbid the growth of medical marijuana in your backyard, or regulate what kind of toilet you're allowed to have in your house, or for that matter, do something like the war on drugs, which forbids the possession of drugs throughout the country, and the like."
Social Studies,"Originally the power to regulate interstate commerce, which is the authority under which most of these things are done, it was at the time conceived of as a power for Congress to break down trade barriers between states and perhaps regulate the actual shipment or trading goods and services across state lines."
Social Studies,"It was not until the 20th century, particularly after the New Deal, that Congress was able to start using this as a power to regulate nearly every aspect of human life that might in some respect affect the national economy. So that, I think, is a huge change. - [Dean Gerken] I think what would really surprise the framers is how willing Congress has been to give up its own power."
Social Studies,"So Congress has given the president a lot of power, because it's created administrative agencies with vaguely defined mandates that therefore allow the president to use his entire administrative agency apparatus to pursue his goals. - [Kim] So we've learned that Article I of the Constitution establishes the Legislative Branch of the U.S. government, which is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives."
Social Studies,"These two bodies were created to balance popular power with elite power, since members of the House of Representatives were directly elected by the people, whereas senators were appointed by state legislatures. Although one major change is that senators are now elected as well, what might really surprise the framers about Congress today is how its power has evolved over time."
Social Studies,"On one hand, as Heather Gerken mentioned, the powers of the president and the Supreme Court have grown compared to the powers of Congress, but on the other hand, as Ilya Somin points out, the framers might be surprised at just how much of our lives Congress can regulate today.

Social Studies,"After all, the Founders had just rebelled against a monarchy where power was placed in the hands of one individual. They'd been so nervous about executive power that the first governmental system of the United States, the Articles of Confederation, didn't have an executive branch at all. So to learn more about Article Two I sought out the help of some experts."
Social Studies,"Professor Sai Prakash is an expert in the separation of powers, particularly executive powers and teaches constitutional law, foreign relations law, and presidential powers at the University of Virginia School of Law. For more on the debate about what an executive branch should look like, I talked to Professor Michael Gerhardt. He's a leading constitutional scholar whose specialties include civil rights, civil liberties, and separation of powers."
Social Studies,"So Professor Prakash, why did the framers choose to invest power in a president? Were there any other options for an executive branch? - [Professor Prakash] They thought about creating an executive council, which would have been composed of three or more executives that would have jointly exercised whatever executive power they vested in the executive. And so you might have had a triumvirate like they had in Rome, or an executive council like they had in some states."
Social Studies,"And they also thought about doing something slightly different, which is to have a single president, but then require the president to go to a separate executive council before he made several important decisions but in the end they decided we like to concentrate executive authority in the hands of one person thinking that that would be better for law execution, better for assigning responsibility, would bring energy to the executive branch and the executive branch wouldn't be riven with dissent and dissension."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] I asked Professor Gerhardt how long it took the framers to decide on the form the executive branch would take. - [Professor Gerhardt] It was something on which the framers came to an agreement pretty quickly. They came into Philadelphia and almost at the very outset there was a proposal that came forward from Virginia, part of the Virginia Plan, and the Virginia Plan proposed a single executive who would serve for seven years and not be eligible for reelection."
Social Studies,"The delegates would eventually agree on certain features which are now encapsulated or can be found in Article Two. - [Kim] I think one of the tensions we see in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is trying to create a structure for government that's strong enough to do what it needs to do, but also one that doesn't have too much power so that it doesn't become a tyranny as the framers had seen in Europe."
Social Studies,"So were they nervous about having an executive branch in the first place? - [Professor Prakash] That's a great question, Kim. You know, we had a confederation before the Constitution. It was called the Articles of Confederation and in that system we had Congress acting as a plural executive."
Social Studies,"And Congress and the observers of Congress thought that Congress wasn't really well suited to playing the role of executive, to supervising foreign affairs, and to supervising executive officers both military and civilian. And so by the eve of the Philadelphia Convention where they wrote the Constitution there were quite a few people saying we need to have a separate executive."
Social Studies,"We need to invigorate it with authority because if we do that we will then have a successful new government under the new Constitution. - [Professor Gerhardt] Alexander Hamilton, for example, wanted an executive who would basically serve for life. He didn't get it. You can imagine that for many delegates an executive who could serve for life would sound an awful lot like a king, and that's exactly what they had just rebelled against."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] Other people said if you create a unitary executive, if you create this single executive, chief executive you're gonna have a monarchy."
Social Studies,"You're gonna have someone who is intent upon seizing powers of various sorts, who's going to want to install maybe a hereditary monarchy somehow and that was the tension between those who wanted to have a stronger executive, a stronger single executive thinking that that would be the best thing for the government and those who thought that a single executive would descend into a monarchy."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So I imagine it was pretty tricky for the Framers to think how they could have an executive branch that was powerful enough to get things done, but not so powerful that it took on that tyrannical cast that they were really eager to avoid. So what powers did the president eventually end up having? - [Professor Prakash] You know, the president is made commander in chief of the army and the navy. He has the power to pardon."
Social Studies,- [Professor Gerhardt] The president has the authority to nominate people to certain high-ranking offices subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. Among those offices are included Supreme Court justices. The president has the authority to be able to negotiate treaties.
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] So he's got a host of authorities, and then there's the central question that's disputed, Kim, which is does the first sentence of Article Two, which says the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States, does that also give the president any authority beyond what's listed in Article Two sections two and three? So for instance, does the Vesting Clause of Article Two give the president authority over law execution? Is he able to direct the execution of federal laws by subordinate executive officers? Does the president have the power to remove executive officers by virtue of the Vesting Clause? And then significantly, does he have foreign affairs authorities by virtue of the Vesting Clause to speak to other nations to direct US ambassadors, etc? And that's a dispute that's been ongoing for 200 years whether the Vesting Clause really grants additional authorities to the president."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Gerhardt] So all those different powers we now more or less take for granted that are common to US presidents are all set forth, for the most part, expressed in the Constitution. There are a few implicit powers the president will take on over time. - [Kim] As I understand it, the president's powers have grown fairly significantly over time."
Social Studies,"Do you think the Framers would be surprised by how much power the president has today? - [Professor Gerhardt] Yes, it's grown, I think to be perhaps more powerful than many of the Framers initially thought it might be. There were some authorities, for example, the power to remove people in the executive branch that are not spelled out explicitly in the Constitution."
Social Studies,"Over time, the presidency would acquire that power and ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States would ratify that, or affirm that authority. That's one big area, removal power, over executive branch officials that gets clarified and sharpened over time."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] Over time the president has cited, president and his assistants have cited the Vesting Clause as a source of a great amount of authority and some of those claims you might think are consistent with the Constitution and others you might think are inconsistent. So what are the things that presidents have claimed? They've claimed the authority to direct the execution of federal statutes. I think that's consistent with the original design."
Social Studies,"They've claimed some limited authority over foreign affairs. I think that, too, is consistent with the original design. They've also claimed authority to exercise certain powers in emergencies, that's more contested and more debatable whether they have some sort of emergency power either temporary or otherwise."
Social Studies,- [Professor Gerhardt] When Abraham Lincoln comes into power Congress is not in session and Lincoln's gotta respond in real time to an invasion on federal territory and to try to begin the protection of the United States and he does that initially without Congress being a part of it because he has to move very quickly.
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] They've also claimed the authority to wage war and that's also contested because of course Congress has the power to declare war and many people believe that that text means that Congress gets to decide whether to wage war. Modern presidents take the position, or often take the position that they can use military force overseas without getting a declaration of war or more precisely, without getting congressional approval for the use of force overseas."
Social Studies,"So yes, the president's powers have changed over time and that's a source of deep controversy. - [Kim] So what checks can the executive branch use on the legislative or judicial branches of government? - [Professor Prakash] Kim, the executive has a veto. And the veto permits the president to reject legislation sent to his desk by Congress."
Social Studies,"So under the Constitution, congress has to present all legislation to the president and he can either sign it and thereby make it law, or he can veto it, and if he vetoes it and he sends back his objections to Congress they then have the option of overriding the veto by a two-thirds vote in both chambers."
Social Studies,"And so the veto gives the president great leverage over Congress 'cause they know that if he vehemently opposes a particular piece of legislation they can only pass it if there are rather sizable supermajorities in both chambers. - [Professor Gerhardt] He has a power to be able to pardon people for federal offenses. So again, that's a unique presidential authority."
Social Studies,"The presidency, in a sense, is taking more of the limelight away from Congress, which might be making the law, but administering the law is gonna require a lot more time and put the president in the position of also exercising discretion over how to enforce the law."
Social Studies,"So that becomes another important authority of the presidency, how do you go about enforcing it? What kind of discretion do you have when you do enforce it? - [Professor Prakash] He also has the power to recommend measures to them under the Constitution. That is to say he can suggest that they pass legislation on a particular subject thereby making sort of a vague suggestion, or he can actually present them a bill and say I'd like you to consider this."
Social Studies,"They don't have to act on the bill, but he has that authority. And you know, he can also tell them about the state of the union, right? That's the State of the Union Clause. So those are the checks he sort of has on Congress and those are significant checks. The members of Congress don't get paid unless the president signs the bill that passes the appropriation for them or they override his veto. So those are significant checks."
Social Studies,"And then with respect to the judiciary, Kim, there aren't as many checks in the Constitution. The Constitution never says the executive branch has to execute judgements issued by the courts, but that's been our practice, and I think it's an implicit feature of the Constitution that when courts issue judgements the executive will honor them and enforce them."
Social Studies,"Because that's an implicit feature of the Constitution presidents don't really have much leverage over the courts, right, because the president does get to nominate then and goes get to appoint them and that gives him some sort of say over who becomes a judge, but once they're judges he doesn't have any say over what they decide and he typically, as I said, enforces their judgment. So the check on the judiciary is, who gets into the federal courts, who gets to serve as a federal judge."
Social Studies,"Once they're judges the president doesn't have the same kind of check that he has on Congress. There's no veto on judicial decisions, for instance. - [Professor Gerhardt] The president can unilaterally or on his own issue what are called executive orders, which are essentially mandates that govern the operations within the executive branch. One president can set the priorities one way, but another president can reshape them a different way."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, 'cause executive orders can do very positive things like Truman's executive order that the armed services be integrated, but they can also do very negative things, for example, interning Japanese Americans during World War Two. - [Professor Gerhardt] That is correct. And so the executive orders oftentimes might reflect a particular president's values, but it can also particular president's priorities."
Social Studies,"The challenge with an executive order is that it only lasts longer than a particular president's term if other presidents are willing to sign off on them as well. And so for example, you can see how President Trump has decided not to continue certain executive orders that President Obama put into place just as President Obama chose not to extend certain executive orders President George W. Bush put into place. - [Professor Prakash] Lots of rules and laws are not made by Congress in the modern era."
Social Studies,"They're made by executive and independent agencies and so a lot of the rules that we have to follow about the environment or about labor or about securities, they come from agencies and not directly from Congress. And when the agency is an executive agency, the president not only appoints the people that run that agency, the president or his assistants in the White House are often involved in crafting the rules and shaping the rules in various ways."
Social Studies,"And so if we think the mass of rules and legislation comes from the government, the executive and not the Congress, then the president has a great role in that. - [Kim] So our first president was George Washington. In what ways did Washington set important precedents that are still with us today? - [Professor Gerhardt] There are a lot of people, a lot of scholars who think that things would've been quite different had it not been Washington."
Social Studies,And the fact that George Washington would become the first president helped put a lot of people at ease because he was widely viewed as trustworthy and somebody who wouldn't be naturally disposed to become tyrannical.
Social Studies,"And Washington himself understood from the very outset of his administration that nearly everything he did would create a precedent for other presidents to follow, and so Washington ends up becoming quite influential, not just in helping to define things, but also in reassuring people that this system can get off the ground and the presidency wouldn't necessarily be a tyrannical office and that the president, in fact, could be an effective part of a new government."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Prakash] If Washington's not there and they can't see an honest man taking over as president, you might very well have had an executive council."
Social Studies,"You know, they might have been wary of who would be a unitary executive and wanted to have a plural executive in order to make sure that no one person became too powerful, and another way of thinking about this is if you create a new Constitution in the wake of President Nixon, you're gonna have a different Constitution because people are more distrustful of executive authority."
Social Studies,"If you have a new Constitution after a really honest and noble and successful presidency, people are gonna write an executive article that's more favorable to the president. And the situation for Washington couldn't have been more favorable. They had seen the problems with weak execution under the articles and in the states. They thought that weak executives were a problem."
Social Studies,"They saw this person who could be a strong executive and be a responsible and wise executive and those two things conspired to create an executive that was one of the most powerful in the world. - [Professor Gerhardt] So Washington is trying to signal, look, we don't want to create tyrants here. We're not kings, we're not presidents for life. We'll serve at most for a couple terms and then we will willingly lay down our authority and let other people follow us."
Social Studies,"That's actually a critical precedent, but again, every president until Franklin Roosevelt follows and it's one that reflects Washington's special values that the most important office, ultimately, is not the office of the presidency, it's actually the office, so to speak, the position of being a citizen of this country."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that thanks to the example set by George Washington, the Framers of the Constitution felt confident that they could invest power in a president to have an energetic executive branch. But as Sai Prakash noted, the Framers might be surprised at the way the president's powers have grown over time through executive orders and the use of military force."
Social Studies,"However, Michael Gerhardt brings up an important point that in the United States the president is first and foremost a citizen, not a ruler. To learn more about Article Two, visit the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"Jeff Rosen is the President and CEO of the National Constitution Center, and he's written extensively about the courts and the Supreme Court in particular. Richard Garnett is a professor of law and political science at the University of Notre Dame School of Law. Jeff, can you tell us a little bit about the Framer's vision for the judicial branch? How much power did they intend for the judicial branch to have? - [Jeff] Let's start by reading the text. That's always the best place to start."
Social Studies,"The text of Article III, the very first sentence says, ""The judicial Power of the United States, ""shall be vested in one supreme Court, ""and in such inferior Courts as Congress may ""from time to time establish."" The Framers expected that we would have a Supreme Court and that would be separate from the legislature and the president, but it was up for Congress to decide what other federal courts we'd have, if any."
Social Studies,"And it's so interesting that the Framers are so focused on a system where state courts are the main interaction that people have with the judicial system. They didn't even require Congress to set up inferior federal courts at all. - [Kim] So what does Article III tell us about how the judicial branch is supposed to be structured? - [Richard] Well, it doesn't say a whole lot. It's interesting. So some people are surprised when you actually read the text of Article III."
Social Studies,"It sets up the Supreme Court, and it says that all of the federal judicial power is gonna be in that Supreme Court, but it doesn't tell us anything about, say, courts of appeals or trial courts. It clearly envisions that Congress is gonna create some, but it really did leave it to Congress to decide how to structure the judicial system."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So what are some of the ways that the role of the Supreme Court has changed over time? - [Richard] I think it's fair to say that there's a lot more federal law than there used to be, and so there are more questions that are potentially questions for the Supreme Court than there used to be. I mean, if you think of the country's early history, most of the legal action was in the states and the state courts and the state legislatures."
Social Studies,"There wasn't that much, there weren't that many questions for the Supreme Court to answer. As the federal government grows, as federal law expands, that creates more work for the Supreme Court. What does equal protection mean? What does due process mean? What's the balance between the freedom of speech on the one hand and intellectual property on the other say? These are questions that the Founders might not have been able to envision being judicial questions."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] Alexander Hamilton, Federalist 78, famously said that the judiciary would be the least dangerous branch because it had neither purse nor sword. The Framers thought the Congress would be the most dangerous branch because it had the most enumerated powers. The presidency second, 'cause limited but constrained powers, and judiciary the least dangerous because it didn't have the army and it had no money and all it could do was issue judgments and hope that they would be accepted by the other branches."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So say that I'm a Supreme Court justice. Good work, me. (laughing) And a case comes before me and it's up to me now to interpret the Constitution in such a way that I can answer questions about this certain case."
Social Studies,"So what would be some of the tools that I could use to help me in my interpretation? - [Richard] Well, there's obviously deep and fascinating disagreements among people about how exactly courts should do that, but one place where you could start, and I think there'd be common ground here, is that all justices believe that it's important to ask, how has the Supreme Court answered questions like this in the past? So the first place you would look would be to the court's own precedents."
Social Studies,"Has the court answered questions like this before? And if so, what did the court say? Because there is a strong sense that the rule of law needs predictability and consistency, and so courts really do make an effort to have their rulings be consistent over time. - [Jeff] You might also be interested in empirical facts. What would be the effect of a particular decision on the country? You might also be interested in theories of natural law, which we talked about in discussing the 9th Amendment."
Social Studies,"Even if the right being asserted isn't written down in the Constitution, is there some case that it is rooted in the history and tradition of our law and that it might come from sources like God or nature and not government? Generally, judges have been reluctant to enforce rights, natural rights, that don't have a positive foundation. A positive right is a right that's written down or codified in some explicit way. A natural right comes from God or nature."
Social Studies,"But in practice, most of the natural rights have tended to be codified in history or tradition and in state constitutions or state laws, so those would be other places you'd look too. But what's really important for viewers to remember, and I want all of you guys to try to do this yourselves, try this yourselves at home, separate your constitutional conclusions from your political conclusions."
Social Studies,"When you're evaluating a law, don't ask, do I think that this form of, say, gun control regulation is a good or bad idea as a policy matter. Ask yourself, do I think the 2nd Amendment allows or prohibits it, and entertain the possibility that your constitutional conclusions might diverge from your political conclusions. You might think gun control is a good idea, but the 2nd Amendment prohibits it, or it's a bad idea but the Constitution allows it."
Social Studies,"And that basic separation of political and constitutional conclusions is central to Hamilton's very theory of judicial review, because that's what stops judges from being policy makers in robes and ensures that they're preferring the will of the people expressed in the Constitution to those of the legislatures, which represent fallible policy views."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] As we learned from early cases like Marbury versus Madison and then even later cases like Brown versus Board of Education, the Supreme Court can render decisions that then no one enforces."
Social Studies,"So how has the Supreme Court avoided becoming kind of a moot point? - [Richard] Yeah, there's a story, and it might be apocryphal, but it's a good story anyway, that President Andrew Jackson said, after the Supreme Court issued an opinion that he didn't like, he said, ""The Supreme Court has issued its opinion, ""now let them enforce it."" Basically making the point that all they could do was issue an opinion and it was up to others to decide to comply."
Social Studies,"I think American culture, and this is something for us to be grateful for, it's been built up over a long time. It has generally been that we have a strong norm, that elected officials should follow the law as it's been declared by the federal courts."
Social Studies,"Now there've been, as you know, controversies about court decisions throughout our history, whether it was the Dred Scott case, which President Lincoln hated, or, as you said, Brown versus Board, which was resisted by some Southern officials after it came down. The court's ability to get its judgments enforced depends on its credibility and on America's culture of respecting the rule of law."
Social Studies,"If the court's credibility goes away, or if Americans stop respecting the rule of law, then the court's judgments will have less force. - [Kim] So the Supreme Court exercises the power of judicial review, which means that it reviews the actions of the executive branch and the legislative branch and can declare those actions unconstitutional."
Social Studies,Do you think the Framers intended for the court to use that power to check the other branches of government? - [Richard] Most scholars would agree that it was widely believed that the Supreme Court would have the power to review the acts of both other federal officials and of state governments and to decide whether or not those acts were consistent with the Constitution.
Social Studies,"There was a lotta disagreement about how excited people were about that power, and again, some people worried that the Supreme Court might abuse its power of judicial review. But the basic idea that it's one of the jobs of a court to make sure that the acts of other officials are constitutional, are consistent with the written Constitution, that idea preexisted Marbury. That idea was clearly in the minds of the Founders when they created the Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] I'm happy to say yes, the Framers did intend for the courts to have the power of judicial review. I'm confident of that both because the power was exercised by courts before and after the framing, and also because Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 78, so explicitly puts the case for judicial review."
Social Studies,"It's such a shame that in that great musical we've got the room where it happened but we don't have the judicial review where it happened, because Hamilton would be a great song about why Hamilton thought that judicial review followed logically from the very theory of popular sovereignty. - [Richard] It really isn't the job of unelected judges to try to update and improve the Constitution that the people ratified."
Social Studies,"In some cases, this isn't much of a challenge, but in others, say, in cases having to do with the freedom of speech or in cases having to do with the war powers and so on, it can be a challenge. It can be a challenge to figure out what exactly the provision meant to those who ratified it, and it can be a challenge to decide whether, if at all, the original meaning needs to be updated in light of more current events."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] Now, there is, of course, much to say in response to Hamilton, and we could have a whole constitutional law course on the responses to Hamilton. His very theory of judicial review is premised on the idea that the Constitution represents the will of the people more emblematically or profoundly or fundamentally than those of ordinary laws."
Social Studies,"The obvious first response is, ""Hey, how can you say that the will of a bunch of dead ""white guys from 1787 ""really represents the will of we, the people of today, ""more accurately than a law that Congress passes?"" The answer to the objection is, well, it's because the Constitution was passed by a special procedure. It was unusually deliberative."
Social Studies,"It took a long time to propose, and it didn't gain the status of supreme law until it was ratified by special conventions that were specially called for the purpose. It was that long process of deliberation that gives that constitutional text the right to speak in we the people's name."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] How could the legislative or executive branch check the power of the Supreme Court? - [Richard] Yeah, our Constitution has a number of these interesting checks and balances features, right? So the three branches are distinct, but there's various ways in which they get into each other's business. The President can veto a law. The President appoints justices, but of course, the Senate has the say about whether to confirm them, and so on."
Social Studies,"So the branches are separate, but they are related and they check each other. - [Jeff] Well, we remember from the text of Article III that the Constitution authorizes Congress to set up such inferior courts as it may, from time to time, choose to ordain and establish. Congress didn't have to create inferior courts. It can create them, it can change them. There's a debate right now about whether the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which occupies much of the west, should be split up."
Social Studies,"Congress can split it up if it wants. Congress can change the number of Supreme Court justices. There were originally six justices and the number went up and down before settling around nine, or rather settling at nine, in the 1860's. So Congress could change the number of justices to punish a president on political grounds."
Social Studies,"When Thomas Jefferson was coming in after the election of 1800, the outgoing Federalist Congress was so determined to punish him that they changed the size of the Supreme Court to deny him the right to make any appointments. - [Richard] The other branches can check the court in a number of ways. So the most dramatic would be you can impeach a justice for high crimes and misdemeanors. That doesn't happen very often."
Social Studies,"Another way, which doesn't happen all that often, but could, is Congress can check the court by, for example, not funding it, or by limiting the issues that the court is allowed to hear. Congress can control what's called the jurisdiction of the court. The court only gets to answer the questions that Congress gives it the power to answer. Now again, Congress is reluctant to do that, but it has sometimes in the past, and it could if Congress thought it were necessary."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] Congress can engage in jurisdiction stripping. There's only a small category of cases that the Supreme Court is required to hear. But broadly, the court has a broad discretion over its docket. If Congress wanted to say, ""Hey, Supreme Court, ""you're not allowed to hear any cases involving abortion,"" for example, it arguably could do that, although such a law might be constitutionally challenged."
Social Studies,"I remember being in law school just kind of indignant at the idea that Congress could violate the separation of powers so flagrantly. My great law professor Akhil Amar convinced me that this had been done throughout American history, that before, during the Civil War, Congress deprived the court of the right to hear certain cases involving national security and so forth."
Social Studies,"So Congress can, if it chooses, exempt certain categories of cases, those that are not in the original jurisdiction of the court, from being heard. There's also the question of whether Congress can impose term limits for Supreme Court justices. There's a proposal floating about to have 18-year terms for the justices and get each president the right to appoint two justices, and have justices retire after 18-year terms."
Social Studies,"There's a vigorous debate about whether that could be done by an ordinary statute, or whether it would require a constitutional amendment. - [Kim] Well, if you had to say there was one big take away about Article III that students should remember, what might it be? - [Jeff] That when courts strike down laws as unconstitutional, they're not thwarting the will of the people, they're supposed to be supporting it."
Social Studies,"Because the Constitution represents the will of the people, ordinary laws represent the will of our representatives. The Constitution is supreme law, so that's why it trumps ordinary legislation. - [Richard] You know, Americans of good faith and good reason have been disagreeing about the court's role for the long time."
Social Studies,"I think a challenge for the court is finding the right balance between asserting its independence and exercising judicial review on the one hand, but on the other, being mindful of the fact that it is undemocratic. The judicial review sometimes involves setting aside what the people have decided they want. That's an awesome power, and it shouldn't be overused."
Social Studies,"So the court, from time to time in history, has been criticized for, perhaps, going beyond what the Constitution actually requires, and instead enforcing, perhaps, their own policy preferences or their own political morality. - [Kim] So we've learned that Article III is crucial to the system of checks and balances that limits the power of government in the United States."
Social Studies,The Supreme Court exercises judicial review to ensure that the executive branch and legislative branch act within the confines of the Constitution. But the other branches have plenty of checks on the judicial branch as well. One of the most central questions about the Supreme Court is the relevance of the Constitution to the issues we face today.
Social Studies,"As Richard Garnett points out, some scholars might say it's undemocratic to overrule the will of the people as expressed through their elected representatives based on the Constitution. But, as Jeff Rosen argues, the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and therefore striking down a law as unconstitutional isn't thwarting the will of the people, but rather preserving it."
Social Studies,"To learn more about Article III, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"Article IV lays out the nuts and bolts of how federalism, the system of shared governance between the states and the federal government works in practice. Article IV has four sections. The first two, the Full Faith and Credit clause and the Privileges and Immunities clause talk about how states will treat each other's citizens as well as they treat the citizens of their own states."
Social Studies,"Then the third section, is an admissions clause discussing how new states will be added to the union and the fourth section is the guarantee clause, which guarantees every state in the union a republican form of government. To learn more about Article IV, I sought out the help of two experts. Erin Hawley is an associate professor of Law at the University of Missouri. Her scholarship focuses on the federal courts and she teaches constitutional litigation, tax policy and agricultural law."
Social Studies,"Professor Gabriel Chin is the director of clinical legal education at the UC Davis School of Law. He's a teacher and scholar of immigration law, criminal procedure and race and law. So professor Hawley can take us a little bit through why the framers included Article IV."
Social Studies,What was its purpose? - [Erin] The founders of the Constitution were very concerned that the federal government be one of limited powers and because of that they saw the states as having an active and critical role in placing a check on the federal government. So we've got the three branches and their own checks and balances and then we've got the federal government and the state government also playing a role in checking and balancing each other.
Social Studies,"They wanted to establish a strong central government but also to ensure that it didn't have too much power and the states were critical to this effort. Also, they very much wanted the states to act collectively not individually. As you'll recall, the states had not been doing so well under the loose articles of the confederation. They've sort of being going it alone on critical issues like trade and defense as to the detriment of the union."
Social Studies,"So Article IV is also a sort of key to making sure that the states act sort of as a unified whole rather than going it alone. - [Gabriel] It's one country made up of diverse states. And if you prefer the way things are done in Nevada you can move there. And if you think that some other state has a better set of answers to the problems of modern life, you can move."
Social Studies,"What the Full Faith In Credit clause, and the Privileges and Immunities clause are designed to do is to facilitate transactions, to facilitate moving, to facilitate communications and commerce and trade and travel among the states. But that doesn't mean that what's going on in each of the states can't be very, very different. - [Kim] We often think of checks and balances as being something that was designed to be kind of horizontal."
Social Studies,"That the legislature and the executive branch and the judicial branch kind of all at the same level checking each other. But there is also kind of this vertical checks and balances happening too between the power of the federal government, power of the states and the power of the local governments. - [Erin] Absolutely so we've got the three branches, and their checks and balances."
Social Studies,"We also have a strong central government, that's checked in large part by strong independent sovereign governments in each of the 50 states. And these states traditionally have what are known as police powers so they have a lot of inherent authority to govern the people in those states, subject to federal law."
Social Studies,"But it really does sort of place a check on federal authority and I think this is precisely what the framers wanted because they did want a strong government, but they also were very much of the view that states were important. That their own states we're important and they didn't want to lose that in the new constitution and new federal government."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] There are four sections in Article IV and the first section deals with full faith and credit, it says full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public Acts, Records and Judicial proceedings of every other state. So what does full faith and credit actually mean? - [Gabriel] It's designed to make in a certain sense, all of the states of the United States part of a single system."
Social Studies,"And so, full faith and credit means that a court judgment for example in one state will be recognized in every state. - [Erin] So if you have a value judgment in New York for example, and you move to California, the California courts are required to give effect to that judgment, to that same court judgment so long as it was validly issued."
Social Studies,"There was a federal statue known as The Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA that was passed under president Clinton, and recently the Supreme Court struck that down as unconstitutional. So now under full faith and credit, if you're married in one state you're married in another state as well."
Social Studies,- [Gabriel] You can see the kinds of problems that would exist if states didn't honor the legal decision that were made by other states such as who is married or who is divorced or who owns a particular piece of property or whether a particular child is going to be in the custody of one parent rather than another.
Social Studies,"And the full faith and credit clause is designed to say, in order for our system to work as a unified whole, while it's true that the courts of Georgia are distinct from the courts of New York, etc. They're separate systems, but they have to treat the work that each other does with respect. - [Kim] If we move onto section II. This says that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states."
Social Studies,"So what are these privileges and immunities? - [Erin] So the privileges and immunities clause has been one that's subject to a number of sort of debates in the courts, in the academic literature. But basically privileges and immunities have been construed to be those sorts of things that would go with citizenship. So the right to travel for example, is a privilege and immunity. Those sorts of things."
Social Studies,"- [Gabriel] Occasionally in American history there have been moments where states didn't want to let citizens of other states come through. So during the depression there was an effort by some states to limit the migration of people from out of state to in-state. And the Supreme Court said, that's not permissible. It also protects the right to travel. In 1999 the Supreme Court dealt with a case called Saenz v. Roe. And what that case was about is that California had relatively generous welfare benefits."
Social Studies,"And California wanted to set up its law in such a way that it wouldn't encourage people from other states to move to California just to get the welfare benefits. So what they did is, they said that if you don't live in California. If you're moving from out of state and you apply for welfare benefits then we're going to give you the welfare benefits that you would have gotten in your state for the first year. We're not going to give you the higher California benefits."
Social Studies,We're going to give you whatever you would of gotten where you came from. That's unconstitutional and the Supreme Court said that violates the privileges and immunities clause. We're one country. One nation. People are allowed to cross the borders whenever they want.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting but there is this second part of it that says no person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence, of any law or regulation therein be discharged from service or labor. So what is that all about? - [Erin] So that is one of the most unfortunate, probably the most unfortunate clauses in our Constitution, it's known as the fugitive slave clause and that title is pretty descriptive."
Social Studies,"So if you have a slave who is validly owned as it were in those days, under one state's law and that person escaped to a free state this clause gave the owner the right to reclaim that slave and put them back into sort of ownership in their own state. - [Gabriel] It is a sneaky way of talking about slavery and this compromise with slavery was necessary to create the United States. Slavery, the word, isn't used in the Constitution. They only use these euphemisms."
Social Studies,These sort of complicated circumlocutions and there is an argument that there is a reason for that. And the reason for that is that a lot of the framers of the Constitution didn't support slavery. Opposed slavery. They did think that it was important to have a United States and to have a Constitution. So they wanted to do what was necessary to achieve that but they did the absolutely minimum and they did it in such a way that consciously doesn't recognize and legitimize the institution of slavery.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Alright so, then we get into new states and territories. So, I think it was very forward looking of the framers to recognize that new states might want to join the Union and then to provide a process for that. So can you tell us a little bit about what that process was like? - [Erin] So article IV section three clause one provides the process for admitting new states."
Social Studies,"Again it recognizes that new states might want to join the Union and it gives wide latitude to congress for admitting new states, so basically the process was that a territory would indicate to the congress that it wished to become a state. Then they would submit a constitution and congress would approve the new state. But the constitution itself in article IV places some limitations on that."
Social Studies,Some of the eastern states we're concerned that the large western territories might become too influential so they had a couple of provisions that no new states could be created out of an old state nor could parts of states be combined to form a new state unless there was consent from all of the involved states. - [Gabriel] And it's not so clear that purchase of territory from foreign governments was a power that was granted in the Constitution to anyone.
Social Studies,"Thomas Jefferson who was the president at the time of the Louisiana Purchase had doubts that the Louisiana Purchase was constitutional. He thought that it was a great idea to purchase all that land from France, but he thought that it would require a constitutional amendment for the United States to have that power. This is different from Texas joining the Union. But the House and the Senate didn't have the same qualms that President Jefferson did."
Social Studies,"And so they agreed to approve the Louisiana Purchase and to fund it. When the bill got to Thomas Jefferson's desk he signed. - [Kim] Moving on to section IV, there is this promise here that the federal government will guarantee every state a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion or domestic violence. What does this mean? - [Erin] So we see here in Article IV the end of Article IV a really sort of famous, an important promise to each of the individual states."
Social Studies,"The federal government is promising, to basically aid them in keeping a republican form of government. As well remember, Benjamin Franklin famously said we've given you a republic if you can keep it. - [Gabriel] So when we talk about invasion in section IV, it talks about invasion, it's pretty clear that what they're talking about is invasion by some hostile state."
Social Studies,"And of course during this period there was continuing conflict with England and the idea is that if New York or South Carolina gets invaded by England, that's not just that particular state's problem it's the nation's problem and the national government has an obligation to protect against invasion. - [Kim] I imagine it also prevents someone from for example declaring themselves the King of Maryland. - [Gabriel] The republican form of government clause does that."
Social Studies,"It leaves the details to the states but the basic idea is that there has, the concept of republican government that's embodied in article IV is majority rule. That even if there were free and fair elections the state could not choose to have military or hereditary government."
Social Studies,"So even if everybody in California got together, and said you know, what we really need is a good family that generation after generation will lead us and they will be the kings and queens of California, and this is what we want so we're going to amend our constitution to provide for hereditary leadership in our state and we're going to find somebody great and this is what we want to do. Article IV would say, we can't choose to do that even through democratic means."
Social Studies,- [Kim] So as we've learned Article IV requires states to give full faith and credit to the legal proceedings of other states and to treat the citizens of other states as well as they treat their own citizens. It provides a process for adding new states into the mix and guarantees a republican form of government to the citizens of all the states. Article IV binds the United States together so it's not just a collection of independent states but rather a unified nation.
Social Studies,To learn more abour article IV visit the National Constitution Centers in Directive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics..
Social Studies,"To learn more about Article five, I talked to two experts, professor Michael Rappaport, who is the Darling Foundation professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, where he also serves as the director of The Center for the Study of Constitutional Originalism and David Strauss, who's the Gerald Ratner distinguished service professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School and author of The Living Constitution."
Social Studies,"Professor Strauss, Article five provides this process for amending The Constitution, can you take us through that process a little bit? How does it work? - [Professor Strauss] Well the quick description of the process is it's really hard, it's really hard to amend The Constitution. There are actually a couple of different processes that are laid out in Article five but only one has ever been used."
Social Studies,"An amendment starts in Congress and two thirds of each house of Congress, two thirds in House of Representatives and two thirds of the Senate has to approved the amendment and then it goes to the states and three quarters of the states have to approve the amendment, so you have to have a really strong consensus in order to get The Constitution changed that way. - [Kim] So, Professor Rappaport, take us through this process of amending The Constitution."
Social Studies,"Why did the framers set it up this way? - [Professor Rappaport] The framers gave a good bit of thought to coming up with an amendment process because they recognized that The Constitution might need to be changed over time either 'cause there were problems with it that weren't anticipated or because circumstances or values changed, so, there are two steps to the amendment process, for an amendment to go into The Constitution to become part of The Constitution it has to be both proposed and ratified."
Social Studies,"On the proposal side, the Congress can propose, alternatively, a proposal can come from the action of the state legislatures, so, two thirds of the state legislatures say we'd like to have a Constitutional Convention propose an amendment, so, there's two parts to that, obviously, the the state legislatures have got to want it and then you get the calling of a Constitutional Convention. Okay, that's the proposal side, there's also the ratification side, which is a little bit simpler."
Social Studies,"You need three quarters of the states to ratify a Constitutional amendment and they can ratify it either through the actions of the state legislatures or the actions of state conventions, which are special bodies which would be elected in order to decide one question, whether or not to ratify that proposed Constitutional amendment. - [Kim] This is fascinating, so, I actually had no idea about the two thirds of the state legislatures being able to propose a Constitutional amendment."
Social Studies,"How often does that happen? - [Professor Rappaport] It has never occurred throughout our history, although, a couple of times there were actions taken to sort of move in that direction but we've never actually had a Constitutional Convention that has proposed any amendments. It's important to go into why the framers would have set up the system the way they did."
Social Studies,"The most usual situation is for the Congress to propose the amendments and that's happened in all of the 27 amendments which have been ratified to become part of our Constitution but what happens if the Congress is the problem? What happens if the Congress is usurping power or they're standing in the way of changes that are important or they need to be reformed? You can't count on the Congress to wanna reform itself so what they did was to have this alternative mechanism which would bypass the Congress and that alternative mechanism was the Constitutional Convention, so the state legislatures proposed, applied for, and the separate entity, the Constitutional Convention, makes a proposal, so they were quite explicit in discussing this, that they wanted this as an alternative to the Congress."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So was this on purpose that they made it very difficult to amend The Constitution? - [Professor Strauss] Well it sure seems like it. Now, of course, we don't know back then what they had in mind, whether they thought, ""Well, the House, the Senate, the states, ""they'll sort of be all run by the same kind of people ""and they'll kind of agree on things."" Maybe they thought that, we just don't know but whatever they were thinking, what they gave us was a very difficult process to get through."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, how long was it from the period when The Constitution was first ratified to the first amendment to The Constitution beyond the Bill of Rights? - [Professor Rappaport] Okay, so, the first 10 amendments were ratified in 1791 and then, just a mere three years later, we had the 11th amendment."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Strauss] There was an 11th amendment in 1798 to correct really kind of a technical problem that the Supreme Court did something that the framers really didn't anticipate it would do, didn't want it to do, and the 11th amendment was adopted to correct that."
Social Studies,"The 12th amendment was adopted in 1804, after the, really, kind of a disaster in the election of 1800, when there was a tie in the electoral college, the framers had not foreseen the rise of political parties and political parties made the system for electing the president they had given us very difficult to work with but then there was nothing."
Social Studies,"That was 1804, then there was nothing until after the Civil War and after the Civil War there were three amendments, then nothing again, really, until the progressive era in the early 20th century when there were, again, a bunch of amendments and then after then, things have sort of tailed off. So, we really see these kind of waves in our history."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] What do you think brings those waves on? Why are there some eras where there are lots of Constitutional amendments and then other eras when there's nothing? - [Professor Strauss] Well, Kim, here I'm gonna say something I think some people will disagree with but, you know, but I think it's right and that is that I don't think the process of amending The Constitution has really been the way we actually change it."
Social Studies,"I think what happens is just because the amendment process is so difficult, we've worked out other ways of changing things and so amendments come along, sometimes, because a change has already happened and people decide, ""Well, let's put it ""in The Constitution just so we can kinda have ""official recognition of it."" But a lot of time changes happen and they are a little bit too controversial to get into The Constitution but they seem pretty solid and pretty secure, so, we just don't, I guess it's fair to say, don't bother to amend The Constitution or don't wanna go through the process of amending The Constitution."
Social Studies,- [Professor Rappaport] Very often peoples' values may change or they may differ from what's in The Constitution and it may take a time or circumstances may finally occur that crystallize this desire to change The Constitution and all of a sudden the opportunity is there and people can suddenly pass a Constitutional amendment. It's only gonna occur during certain circumstances especially when there's strong support for it.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Very interesting, yeah, so it's unlikely that we're gonna have a Constitutional amendment anytime in the near future. When was the last Constitutional amendment? - [Professor Rappaport] So, the simple answer to that was in 1971 we got the 26th amendment that was both proposed and then, remarkably, it's an all time record, proposed and ratified in three months and eight days and that was the amendment that guaranteed the right to vote of 18 year olds."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Ah, right, so sort of as a response to the Vietnam War? - [Professor Rappaport] Yes, yes but there actually has been one additional amendment, the 27th amendment, right, so why isn't that the most recent one? Well, here's the funny thing about it, the 27th amendment was proposed as part of the original Bill of Rights in 1789, so this amendment was proposed in 1789, ratified in 1992, so it took 202 years."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] What you're saying, what's the 27th amendment about? - [Professor Rappaport] That has to do with congressional salary increases."
Social Studies,"It basically says if Congress wants to raise its own salary, the increase can't take effect until the next election, so it basically give the voters a chance to say, ""Hey, we don't like what you did, ""we're gonna vote you out of office ""for increasing your salary."" - [Kim] So, one thing that strikes me about Article five or just the fact that the founders included an amendment process altogether, it seems very humble and farsighted to include a way for the document itself to evolve in a way, do you think that the framers approached The Constitution with the idea that there were things in the future that they just wouldn't be able to anticipate? - [Professor Strauss] They had before them and were acutely aware of a history in which efforts to establish governments had failed and they were really trying to work with that and make sure they didn't do the same thing so they knew what a hard job they were embarking on and they made it clear, I mean, there's a famous passage in which James Madison said, ""Look, we know a lot of these provisions ""that we're writing in The Constitution ""their meaning is unclear and their meaning ""will have to be history's liquidated."" Which is to say, people have to figure out what this means because we know what we're giving you is unclear in some ways, so, yes absolutely they knew there were things they could not anticipate."
Social Studies,"The framers themselves weren't in agreement on what freedom of speech means, you know, some of them enacted and voted for and got enacted laws that restricted speech in ways that we would find intolerable today, we'd say they violate the first amendment but here you have some of the guys who drafted the first amendment voting for those laws."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, near the end of Article five, there's this kind of long-winded clause that says, ""No amendment which may be made prior to the year ""one thousand eight hundred and eight ""shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses ""in the ninth section of the first article."" Now, if I'm cross referencing this correctly, what they're really saying here is, you can't make amendments about slavery, so why is this here and why are they talking around it so obliquely? - [Professor Rappaport] The interesting thing about this is what do they do, they basically said, for 20 years there's not going to be any amendments that are going to speak to the slave trade and The Constitution is very, let us say shy, about using the term slavery or referring to slavery, it actually never refers to the term slave, there's a variety of thoughts about what was going on but one very common view about this is that The Constitution was sort of a little bit embarrassed, that the framers were a little bit embarrassed, or at least some of the framers were embarrassed about it and so they didn't wanna make reference to it too explicitly."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Strauss] They might've been a little bit worried about what the verdict of history would be, so, they knew on some level this sort of immorality of slavery but there it is, right there in Article five and there are other places in The Constitution too where they don't use the word but what they're doing is protecting slavery."
Social Studies,"And they did add these amendments to The Constitution about slavery and about, as you say, equal citizenship and voting but, you know, the 14th amendment providing equal citizenship, that was pretty much nullified in most respects for a large part of our history, states found a way to get around that."
Social Studies,"The 15th amendment was also something that was just not very effective in preventing African Americans from being denied the vote and, yes, there are provisions in The Constitution that are there and you can evoke them and you can rely on them but if you just look at the text of The Constitution, I think you get a misleading impression about how The Constitution in our history has actually worked."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] This is a very good point because I think one of the hardest things for students of U.S history to understand is how is it possible that after the 14th amendment was passed, things like Jim Crow happened and I guess the answer is The Constitution is only in force if it's enforced. - [Professor Strauss] Yeah, Kim, that's exactly right."
Social Studies,"It's words on a page, you know, the text is fine, it can say all the right things but the institutions and the popular will have to be in place to make something of those fine words."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, so how do you think our government might be different if The Constitution didn't include this amendment process? - [Professor Strauss] I don't think it would've been that different just because Article five gives us such a hard process to go through just because it's so hard to amend The Constitution, we figured out other ways to change The Constitution in practice, even if the words on the page are the same and I think if there were no Article five, we would've found a way to get to where wanted to get to as a country by those needs, by legislation, by presidential action, by Supreme Court decision, and just by the people in their lives saying, ""You know, we need to go in this direction, ""we need to go, say, in the direction of women's equality."" And, by the way, there's no amendment giving women equal rights either but that's where we've gotten to and I think that would've been the pattern if there were no formal amendment process."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Rappaport] There's a second way in which you can have Constitutional change, which is you could simply say, ""Alright, this Constitution was pretty good for awhile, ""it's now outlived its usefulness, ""let's have a new Constitution."" That would seem like a very radical, big thing to do, virtually no on proposes that at the federal level but in the states, lots of states have changed their constitutions, not simply passed a Constitutional amendment, but just gotten rid of a whole constitution and adopted a new one."
Social Studies,"That's happened many times and, so, if we didn't have a Constitutional amendment process, it's quite possible that that's exactly what we would've seen at the federal level."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Wow, this is really fascinating because we really think a lot about what the framers intended, you know, for certain amendments, for example, you know, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, what did they really mean by those things but if we had just kind of every now and again said, ""Okay, we're done with that, let's do a new Constitution,"" we wouldn't necessarily have that debate, we'd just say, ""Okay, this is what we meant at the time."" - [Professor Rappaport] Famously Thomas Jefferson said, ""Oh, you know, it's really not right to have ""a Constitution that's going to continue over time ""and bind future generations and, so, ""we ought to have a new Constitution every 19 years ""when there's a new generation."" And his close friend, James Madison, had to disagree with him and basically said, ""Look, I understand why you're saying that ""but you also have to realize the incredible disruption ""that would cause every 20 years, ""people wouldn't be able to rely on the existing rights ""that are in The Constitution 'cause they would know ""in a certain period of time new ones would be enacted."" We had that debate, Madison won in the sense that the U.S."
Social Studies,"Constitution is supposed to last for a long-term period, there's no 20 year limit on it, and one of the things that's been beneficial for the United States as a result of that is that we've inherited these Constitutional rights that people have a lot of reverence for."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, we've learned that there are two ways to amend The Constitution, through Congress or through a special Constitutional Convention called by the states, either way, adding an amendment to The Constitution is really difficult to do, so much so, that the American people have only in special circumstances used a Constitutional amendment to affect social or political change."
Social Studies,"To learn more about Article five, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"It covers debts, religious tests for office, and it establishes the constitution as the supreme law of the land. To learn more about what binds these diverse ideas together I sought out the help of two experts. Kermit Roosevelt is a professor of law specializing in Constitutional Law and conflict of laws at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. And, Michael Ramsey is professor of law and director of International and Comparative Law programs at the University of San Diego School of Law."
Social Studies,"So, let's start out talking about the debts portion of Article VI. Professor Roosevelt, why were the framers so interested in debt? What was the historical context that led them to explicitly address debt in Article VI? - [Kermit] Debt is important generally because nations often need to borrow money. And specifically, with the constitution and the Articles of Confederation the US Government had been borrowing money to pay for the Revolutionary War."
Social Studies,"So, there was a question, we're moving from a sort of loose confederation almost like a treaty between nations under the Articles of Confederation to a single unitary country with a stronger national government under the constitution. And, there's a question, is it still the same country? Will the new United States pay the debts of the old United States? - [Michael] Now, there's a general principal of international law that a successor government undertakes the obligations of the predecessor."
Social Studies,"So, you wouldn't necessarily think this would be a problem, but I think they were particularly concerned because the idea of a republic was a somewhat new one, at least in the 18th century, a somewhat unusual one. And, the change of a republican government might cause some worries in Europe where this money was owed. So, I think they just wanted to reassure all of the creditors that even if they were changing their method of government that that wasn't going to effect any of the debts."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] What might have happened if they decided not to pay those debts? - [Kermit] If they decided not to pay the debts than other countries would probably have been much less willing to lend money to the new United States because they might have thought, ""Well, you know, another change ""in government could occur."" - [Michael] There was substantial question throughout the world whether the United States would be able to survive in the face of all the challenges that they had after gaining their independence."
Social Studies,"So, in order to make it seem that the United States was a country that could be trust, a country that could be expected to stick around and not collapse into chaos or revert to colonial status one of the most important things for them was to show that the debts would be honored because a failure to honor debts would suggest that the country did not, in fact, have a true sovereignty and it was not prepared to be an actor on the international stage that could be trusted."
Social Studies,"- [Kermit] Another interesting thing to contrast this to is the treatment of debts after the Civil War where, of course, the United States, the federal government paid its own debts but there's a provision in the 14th Amendment explicitly repudiating the Confederate debt. So, if you loaned money to the Confederate States of America you're never getting that back because we didn't treat that as a valid government that would be continued going forward."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] Another thing that it illustrates is that the constitution, in some respects, was a visionary document that was concerned with a long term future of the United States. But, in other respects it responded to very immediate practical problems that the framers faced in their day. They were thinking about not just the future of the country for the ages, they were thinking about that, but they weren't thinking just about that."
Social Studies,"They were also thinking about reassuring France with respect to the debts that existed right at that moment. - [Kim] So, there's a lot going on in Article VI. And specifically, it talks about the constitution as the supreme law of the land. So, what's important about that statement? - [Kermit] What's important about that is that means the Constitution is our highest law. It prevails over any other kind of law in a conflict. So, one thing that that means is the constitution is supreme over state law."
Social Studies,"And then, the constitution actually goes on to talk about that a little bit more. But, it also means the constitution is supreme over federal law. So, everyone is bound by the constitution. The states can't go against it. Congress can't go past it. The president can't violate constitutional restrictions. The constitution is really the last word. It's the pinnacle or the keystone of the arch of American democracy."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] And, that's why we can say that things are unconstitutional, that laws are unconstitutional and therefore invalid. And, most importantly, it's why the Supreme Court can say that laws are unconstitutional and invalid. It creates a superior law that limits the laws that can be passed by the other parts of the government. It creates a hierarchy of laws. And, in doing so, it assures that we have a single set of rules that applies to all the states and to the federal government."
Social Studies,"And, it can't be changed except by an amendment, which is relatively difficult to do. There's a procedure in the constitution for how you can amend the constitution, but until amended the constitution, as written, is our superior law. And, that was different from the way that the rules that the framers were used to under the English system where they didn't have a written constitution. They had an unwritten constitution, but that constitution was subject to change by parliament."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, has the supremacy of the constitution been tested over time? - [Kermit] There haven't been a lot of claims that the constitution is not supreme. So, generally speaking everyone gives, at least, lip service to this idea. What's been tested is more the question of who gets to decide what the constitution means and when something conflicts with it."
Social Studies,"So, if you want the constitution and federal law to be supreme, probably you would want to have someone in the federal government deciding when there's a conflict, say with state law."
Social Studies,"And, the forms that resistance that has taken over the years are more states saying not, ""We can go against the constitution, we're above ""the constitution,"" but states saying, ""We don't think ""what we're doing violates the constitution,"" right, ""And you at the Supreme Court, you think it does ""but you're wrong."" - [Michael] In the 19th century just before the Civil War the Supreme Court decided in the Dred Scott case that African Americans could not be citizens to the United States, even if they were freed slaves."
Social Studies,"And, President Lincoln believed that that was wrong. He said that there was nothing in the constitution that denied that, the ability of them to be citizens. And, he said that the Supreme Court had misinterpreted the constitution. And, he would accept the Supreme Court's ruling in that regard. Later, in the 20th century, the Supreme Court held that the constitution barred segregation, particularly in schools in the Brown versus Board of Education case."
Social Studies,"But, many southern governors and other institutions throughout the south thought that the Supreme Court had gotten that one wrong. And, they refused to abide by what the Supreme Court had said the constitution means. - [Kermit] What they said was not the constitution doesn't bind us, but we know what the constitution means better than you, Supreme Court, you're wrong. You're making this up, it's political, it's not judging. - [Kim] Another thing that Article VI talks about is religious tests."
Social Studies,"Why were the framers so interested in preventing religious tests in government? What sort of historical evils were they trying to prevent? - [Kermit] So, this is connected to the basic idea of the separation of church and state. And, you separate church and state really to protect both of those things. So, you wanna protect religion from being corrupted by political considerations, but you also want to protect your political system from being a battleground between rival religions."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] So, where this comes from is that in England they had had a series of what they called Test acts. And, what the Test Acts did was it required that for people to be eligible for government offices that the people had to be members of the Church of England. And, that other religious groups they were barred by the Test Act from holding government office."
Social Studies,"So, actually many of those minority religions, many adherents of those ended up coming to the American colonies to gain some measure of religious freedom. The pilgrims were an example of that. There was a Catholic colony in Maryland. And, just generally speaking many of the people, many of the colonists who came over were people who were not part of the main established church in England. And so, you can see why they would not wanna have something like the Test Acts."
Social Studies,"And, they wanted to make clear that in the new national government that any religion or no religion would be allowed for government office holders."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Do you think it's true that we don't have religious tests or oaths in the United States? How about the practice of swearing on a Bible during the presidential inauguration? - [Kermit] Well, the practice of swearing on a Bible is very interesting, as is the fact that when the president recites the oath of office every president, going back to George Washington, has added on to the end of it, ""So help me God."" There's actually an oath in the constitution the president has to swear to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution."
Social Studies,"But, the constitution doesn't say, ""So help me God."" The presidents just add that on on their own. And actually, that sort of illustrates the way in which the constitution treats religion, which is it can't be part of government in an official sense, but we know that members of government are also people. And, they have religious beliefs that are important to them. And, we don't demand that they exclude religion from their lives, we just demand that it be separated from government authority."
Social Studies,"So, you can swear on a Bible if you want to. You don't have to. You can swear on some other religious book. We had a member of congress take an oath of office on a Quran. So, individual government officials are allowed to include religion in so far as it's about them personally. What you think is appropriate to mark this occasion, what solemnifies this oath for you, you can do that. But, we can't require it, and they can't make the exercise of their power religious in nature."
Social Studies,"So, you can't, as a government official, exercise your power on religious grounds. - [Kim] Something that strikes me about Article VI is that it addresses so many different things. Do you have a sense of why debts and constitutional supremacy and religious tests are all in one article. - [Michael] Article VI, as you said, is a little bit of a grab bag. It's not entirely clear how these different pieces of Article VI relate to each other."
Social Studies,"And, I think they were just things that the framers wanted in the constitution and didn't know, for sure, where else to put them. - [Kermit] I'm not exactly sure why the debts are there. If I had to say something about Article VI it would be it's sort of the glue that holds the constitutional architecture together. So, maybe the debts are in there to explain the continuity between the US government under the Articles of Confederation and the US government under the constitution."
Social Studies,"Then, the supremacy clause explains how all of the different parts of the federal system are supposed to fit together. And, what the supremacy clause is saying the constitution is above all of them. The constitution connects them all. Everyone has to abide by the constitution. And, it tells you the constitution is the highest law, then you've got federal law, and then below that is state law. So that, if there's a conflict between federal law and state law, the federal law is gonna win."
Social Studies,"And then, the last part of Article VI is sort of doing the same thing. Because, what holds a country together? What binds people into a single people? In a lot of countries at the time of the founding it was religion, right, religion was the glue that held the society together. And, if you weren't a member of that religion you were an outsider or you were a second class citizen. You would be shunned and not given equal rights in some ways."
Social Studies,"The last clause of Article VI says something sort of similar about America, except it explicitly says it's not religion that binds us together, right? No religious tasks can be required but you do have to take an oath. What do you have to pledge to support? You have to pledge to support the constitution. So, there again, it's telling you the constitution is what we all have in common. That's what makes us Americans. That really is the glue that binds our society together."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, we've learned that Article VI is, as Professor Roosevelt put it, the glue that binds the country together. In assuming the debts from the era of the Articles of Confederation Article VI established the continuity of the U.S. government. It also placed the constitution, not religion, as the supreme law of the United States. To learn more about Article VI visit the National Constitution Center's interactive constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"At least nine states had to ratify the Constitution in order to replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation. To learn more about the ratification process, I sought out the help of two experts. Mark Graber is the Jacob A. France Professor of Constitutionalism at the University of Maryland Francis King Kerry School of Law. Michael Rappaport is the Darling Foundation professor at the University of San Diego School of Law."
Social Studies,"Professor Graber, can you tell us a little bit about the political context of ratification? What was going on at this time as the framers tried to put a new Constitution into the fabric of the United States? - [Mark] Well, one central problem of the Articles of Confederation was the Articles required that all 13 states consent for any amendment."
Social Studies,"And it turned out, at this time, Rhode Island was a great outlier so Rhode Island wasn't gonna consent to much of anything, and, in fact, Rhode Island did not even send delegates to the convention that drafted the Constitution, so the framers knew that if you had the unanimous rule for ratification, it would not work. Instead they chose nine, it's about two thirds, three fourths, in part to make sure Rhode Island and one outlier could not prevent adoption."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] So, let's remember, there's two stages here in how the Constitution gets written and ratified. First, it's written in what's called The Drafting Convention, or the Philadelphia Convention, which was held during the summer of 1787, and in that convention, it's pretty much in agreement that the federal government needed to be made stronger, but that was just a proposal."
Social Studies,"In order for the Constitution to be ratified, it needed nine of the thirteen states and so it went to the second stage, and there things were, in some ways, gonna be more difficult, because there was a variety of viewpoints in the different states."
Social Studies,"The main question that came up in state after state after state was, was the federal government being given too much additional power? Under the previous regime of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government had very limited powers, and the Constitution was gonna give the federal government more power. - [Mark] They wanted a strategy that, once the balls started rolling, states that were slower were gonna be faced with a choice."
Social Studies,"You could get in on the inside, and maybe affect some changes early, but if you were left out, whatever happened would happen without you, and a lot of states, at the end, were fearful of being left out."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] This strategy worked, and as they went through in tough states, as time went on, so New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Caroline, Rhode Island, in order to get ratification, each time they promised, we'll have a Bill of Rights and those states added a list of amendments that they wanted added to the Constitution. - [Kim] So was it controversial that the framers decided that only nine states would be necessary to ratify the Constitution? - [Mark] Very controversial."
Social Studies,"One of these central points of anti-federalists was that this was illegal, that the existing Constitution said all states so therefore, only all states could change the Constitution. - [Michael] So in that respect, it was somewhat controversial. Another way in which it departed from the Articles is the Articles said you needed the state legislatures to approve the amendments, and the U.S. Constitution said, no, we want state conventions, special bodies elected by the people to approve these things."
Social Studies,"Why did they say that? Because they feared that the state legislatures, who would be losing a lot of power under the Constitution, would vote against it, so they wanted sort of to go directly to the people in these conventions and bypass the state legislatures. - [Kim] So we know that there were some opponents of this new Constitution. How close did they actually come to preventing its ratification? - [Michael] Well, it was a very close fight."
Social Studies,"We look back on it and eventually all 13 states are gonna ratify and it looks like, oh well, that wasn't too much of a trouble, but it was very close and things could have easily gone in the opposite direction. One of the ways in which it was close was that there were just very close votes. Massachusetts was 187 to 168. New Hampshire was 57 47. New York was 30 27. Very close votes. A couple of people changing their mind and that would have meant various states didn't ratify."
Social Studies,"In addition to that, some of the states actually did not ratify. The first thing that happened was Rhode Island, early on in the process, says, we don't like your horrible Constitution, they all expected that. We're not gonna hold even a convention. You want us to hold a convention, we're not gonna hold a convention. We're just gonna have a vote in state. And that vote in the state, 90% of the people voted against the Constitution."
Social Studies,"In a way, Rhode Island actually voted against ratification, although it didn't use the proper method. North Caroline, also, they held a convention, and they were very upset about there not being a Bill of Rights in the Constitution, and they just didn't approve it. They didn't disapprove it, they just did nothing, and they waited. And so, in a way, two of the states voted against ratification."
Social Studies,"- [Mark] North Carolina had not yet ratified when George Washington took office, so, in fact, when George Washington took office, there were only 11 states in the Union. At the end of the day, crucial people, I think, decided it was better to sign the Constitution and be in on the ground floor then stay out and see what happened."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, so, who are some of the major players involved here, and what were they arguing about? - [Michael] There were the federalists, who were arguing in favor of ratifying the Constitution, and the anti-federalists, who were arguing against ratifying the Constitution. The federalists, two of the very famous ones, are familiar names, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison."
Social Studies,"Those two people, that were also particularly important because they decided, Hamilton said, we're gonna have a tough time getting ratification in New York, we need to write some essays defending the Constitution. And so Hamilton and Madison cooperated together and wrote what we now call The Federalist Papers, which were simply essays written in the newspapers trying to urge the New York Convention to ratify the Constitution."
Social Studies,"Eventually those essays were sent to other states and became known, and now we've come to revere those essays as The Federalist Papers. But they were originally just kind of advocacy pieces for ratifying the convention. Now, there were also anti-federalists."
Social Studies,"- [Mark] The anti-federalists, in part, were simply people who opposed the Constitution, and just as is the case as say people opposed Obamacare from both the left and the right, people who opposed the Constitution opposed it for many different reasons, and one of their problems was they were not a united bunch. But, in general, these were people fearful of a very strong national government."
Social Studies,"They believed states were sovereign, they wanted to keep power local, and they were very fearful of what they perceived to be an elite who would run the Constitution after ratification. The names that people may know who were anti-federalist were people like Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams. - [Kim] So what were some of the major arguments made in favor of adopting this new Constitution? - [Michael] There were, I think, two types of arguments. People felt that the articles were not working properly."
Social Studies,"They had all kinds of problems, and one of the strongest arguments that the Federalist papers made was that if we don't fix this and make for a stronger union together, what'll happen is, we'll break apart. Look at what happens when you have a bunch of states all next to one another in a land area. We know what that looks like, it's called Europe, and what happens in Europe? They fight wars with one another all the time, and those wars are very problematic. You have to have big armies, standing armies."
Social Studies,"Now, there were also the particular arguments about what powers were missing that the federal government had. The main arguments were made was the federal government did not have enough power, so they didn't have, for example, the taxing power, and they didn't have a way of enforcing treaties against the states very well, and some of the states were putting tariffs up, so interfering with trade within the country."
Social Studies,"- [Mark] So, states would set tariffs on out-of-state goods, states wouldn't contribute to the national government. Second, we needed to present an united front to foreign governments. We were very worried, what would happen if South Carolina formed an alliance with England and North Carolina formed an alliance with France. That wouldn't be good, the country needed to speak with one voice."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Those are some of the arguments made for adopting the Constitution, what were some of the arguments against adopting this new Constitution? - [Mark] Well, first argument was, even though most anti-federalists admitted the Articles needed some repair, they said it's not really urgent. It's not like the house is gonna fall down tomorrow, it's just, you know, the wind is coming through and we can figure it out. We really want a better Constitution."
Social Studies,"The other arguments were the Constitution put too much power in the national government. It put too much power in elites. The fear was if you had national elections, only elites would win. If you had local elections, people the people actually knew would win."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] They thought, a big national government would be too far away from the people to know what they really needed, as opposed to state governments, which they perceived as being more personal, closer to the needs of individuals? - [Mark] Compare two kinds of elections."
Social Studies,"First, how many people really know anyone who runs for Senator, who runs for President, that you're on a first name basis with? Now, compare, you're in a school club, chances are when someone runs for an office in the school club, you know who they are."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] Another type of argument was, if you give the federal government this power, and even if, and the federalists would always argue that the power was limited that they were being given to the federal government, and the anti-federalists came back and they said, well, you say it's limited but what we know from historical experience is is that once a government's in power, it tends to seize more power."
Social Studies,"There's a lot of vague phrases in the Constitution and the federal government will use those vague phrases to assert greater and greater power. - [Kim] What were some of the strategies that the framers used to entice some of the opponents of a strong central government to ratify the Constitution? - [Michael] The first thing that they did was to try to build up momentum. They knew there were certain states which were strongly in favor of ratification. Small states, sometimes, wanted ratification."
Social Studies,"The first state that comes in is Delaware, and they vote 30 to zero for the Constitution, and a bunch of early states, so let's say the first five states all vote for ratification by pretty lopsided margins. That builds up a kind of momentum. Alright, we have five states, we only need four more. Of course, the next ones that were gonna come were gonna be much more difficult. They then needed to change their strategy at that point. - [Mark] They argued like crazy."
Social Studies,"The Federalist Papers are a very famous example. They indicated they'd be open to amendment once the Constitution was ratified. Then again, in Pennsylvania, when anti-federalists boycotted the convention, and the result is the convention didn't have a quorum, they ordered the sergeant-at-arms to a tavern. The sergeant-at-arms found some boycotting anti-federalists and physically put them in the building so they could count for a quorum. - [Kim] That is terrific."
Social Studies,- [Mark] That one doesn't get told in a whole lot of history books. - [Kim] Wow. - [Mark] The framers could play rough and tumble politics with the best of them.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] A lot of the things that pop up at the time of the framing, I think, we look back on today and imagine, how would this work in today's era, with 330 million Americans? Do you think the system under the Articles of Confederation with a smaller, more local, government could possibly work today? - [Michael] Well, among other things, the Articles had no great means of collecting taxes or gaining revenue."
Social Studies,"Given that modern government needs trillions of dollars, the Articles, if you've got a thousand dollars, it was a miracle, so the Articles clearly don't work. But the Articles were inadequate for 18th century government. They were clearly inadequate, or would be clearly inadequate, for 21st century government. Now, the Constitution appears to have been adequate for 18th century government, whether it is adequate for 21st century government is a fair question."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] One of the interesting questions about the Constitution is, how democratic is the Constitution? This debate about how democratic the Constitution is actually enters into the question about ratification. On one level, the Constitution was democratic because each state in these ratification conventions voted on whether to ratify by majority vote. On the other hand, at the federal level, the ratification requirement required nine out of 13, and the idea there would be, we needed more buy in."
Social Studies,"We needed a limitation on simple majority rule in order to make the system function well, in order to produce a Constitution that would have support from the whole country."
Social Studies,"The interesting thing about that supermajority rule, and something that people don't often make the connection with, is we probably owe our Bill of Rights to that supermajority rule, because if only seven of the 13 states, the minimum majority, had been needed to ratify the Constitution, then it's quite possible that the federalists wouldn't have had to promise to put a Bill of Rights into the Constitution, because they wouldn't have needed to."
Social Studies,"And they were initially quite opposed to putting a Bill of Rights in the Constitution. It was only the fact that they needed nine out of 13 states that really forced their hand and forced them to promise that they would put the Bill of Rights in there. We see, in terms of the ratification, that there's both sort of democratic elements but also republican, or supermajority, elements. - [Kim] We've learned that it wasn't easy to ratify the Constitution."
Social Studies,"The framers bypassed state legislatures and went directly to the people in state conventions, hoping that momentum and arguments for a stronger federal government would entice the opponents of the Constitution to ratify it. It took until 1789 for nine out of 13 states to ratify the Constitution and finally make it law. To learn more about Article VII, check out the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the First Amendment, I talked to two experts. Erwin Chemerinsky is the Jesse H. Choper distinguished professor of law and dean of Berkeley Law. Michael McConnell is the Director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Professor Chemerinsky, there is a lot going on in the First Amendment."
Social Studies,Can you tell us a little bit more about why the framers chose to protect these rights in particular? - [Erwin] The historical background of the First Amendment of the Constitution shows why the framers wanted to be sure that all of the liberties in the First Amendment were safeguarded. Let's focus on freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
Social Studies,"In England, there was, after the printing press developed, licensing so that anyone who wanted to be able to publish anything needed to have a license from the government. As such, licensing was seen to be inconsistent with freedom of speech, freedom of the press; for that matter, freedom of thought, freedom of inquiry."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, okay, so there are a lot of essential freedoms that are packed into this First Amendment, so much that it's almost amazing that we're gonna attempt to talk about them all in one video. But if we dial in to freedom of speech, Professor McConell, what is freedom of speech? Does that encompass some things and not others? - [Michael] Well freedom of speech was actually less important to the framers than the freedom with which it was coupled, which was the freedom of the press."
Social Studies,"The reason for this is that speech that can reach large audiences is much more important to the individual but also dangerous to the state, than mere speech. When you speak, only those people within hearing range can hear you, but when you are able to use Gutenberg's fantastic new technology to publish your sentiments and distribute them widely, maybe even over the entire country or across the Atlantic, reaching hundreds of thousands of people. Now that is powerful."
Social Studies,"You think about how the American Revolution was won. This required spreading the word, it required gaining converts and telling people what their grievances were. To a very great extent this was done through the mechanism of the printing press."
Social Studies,"- [Erwin] When you ask the question, ""What's freedom of speech?"" there's implicit within it the issue of, 'What do we mean by speech?' Ultimately, the answer to your question is that the First Amendment, in protecting speech, broadly safeguards a right to express one's ideas. But it's not absolute. The government can restrict expression if there's a compelling interest."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, can you say more about that? - [Erwin] The Supreme Court always has been clear that freedom of speech is not absolute. The Court has said that there are certain categories of speech that are unprotected by the First Amendment. Incitement and illegal activity is a category of unprotected speech. The Court has said this requires showing that the speech was directed at causing imminent illegal activity, and there is a substantial likelihood of imminent illegal activity."
Social Studies,"Another example: obscenity is unprotected by the First Amendment. The Court struggled for years with trying to define, 'What is obscenity?' Maybe the low point in that is when Justice Potter Stewart said, ""I can't define it, but I know it when I see it."" There are also these categories of speech where the government can prohibit, even punish the expression."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] That's where most of the limitations on the freedom speech and of the press come from, is in order to make sure that we don't hurt other people's rights through the use our own. An example of that, the government can prohibit speech which incites violence against someone. So if you're making a speech and calling upon the crowd to attack somebody's house or their person, that can be punished and prevented as an incitement to violence."
Social Studies,"You can see how that follows from the logical idea of freedom of speech being a natural right, and therefore limited by the rights of other people. - [Kim] So let's turn our attention toward the freedom of religion part of the First Amendment. So the first thing that the Amendment says is about establishment. What does the Establishment Clause prevent? - [Erwin] The language of the First Amendment is important, it says that Congress may make no law respecting the establishment of religion."
Social Studies,Since 1947 the Supreme Court has said that that also applies to state and local governments. The Supreme Court has said this means that the government cannot act with the purpose of advancing religion.
Social Studies,"- [Michael] To the founders, this was a very clear legal concept, namely it was the established Church of England that in the statute books, in the law, the Church of England was referred to as, and I quote, ""The Church by law established."" What did it mean to be established? First of all, it meant that the doctrines of the Church, the 39 Articles of Faith of the Church of England, were voted upon by parliament. So the doctrines, the liturgy, the text, were all adopted by law."
Social Studies,"The established Church was the government's church, and it could be used, and from time to time was used, as a instrument of government or as an instrument of politics. This is a way in which the government is able to have a powerful influence on the way in which values and opinions are inculcated."
Social Studies,"It's one of the most important ideas of the established church, especially in the 18th century, was to teach that there's actually a religious obligation to obey the law and to recognize the king as the supreme leader in matters of both church and state. The framer's experience with this was extremely powerful. - [Erwin] That's because the framers were aware of the religious persecution that had gone on in other countries."
Social Studies,"They were aware of the evils that occur when the government becomes aligned with a particular religion. - [Michael] The principal reason why many of the colonists had come to these shores to begin with was to escape the oppressions of the established Church of England back home, and to come to a place where they would be able to exercise the freedom of religion for themselves. The main opponents of the established church were not anti-Christian or anti-religious people."
Social Studies,"They were the most religious people, and their view was the government should stay our of our church, that we will decide what we believe for ourselves, we will control our own church, we will write our own liturgy, we will decide what version of the Bible we're going to use, we'll choose our own ministers. Thank you very much government, stay out of it. Leave us free to practice our religion without having this kind of an establishment."
Social Studies,"- [Erwin] For instance, a county in Kentucky required that the Ten Commandments be posted in all county buildings. The Supreme Court said, ""The Ten Commandments ""are religious scripture. ""There's no secular purpose for having the Ten Commandments ""posted in county buildings."" The Court declared it unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has said, ""The government can't act ""where there primary effect ""is to advance or to inhibit religion."" For example, there can't be prayer in public schools."
Social Studies,"Even voluntary prayer in public schools in impermissible, because the Court has said that the primary effect of having prayer in public schools is to advance religion. The Court has explained that children will inevitably feel pressure to participate, and this coercion violates the Constitution. - [Kim] So, the First Amendment then prevents that kind of intermingling of the government and the church."
Social Studies,"This is I guess the key idea of separation between church and state, but it also says that the Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. So what does that mean? - [Michael] Free exercise of religion was the right to practice your own religion."
Social Studies,"It didn't keep the government from setting up a church, but it did keep the government from requiring you to attend that church, maybe even to contribute to the church, but also kept the government from preventing you from worshiping elsewhere. So the Establishment Clause by and large prevents the government from forcing people to participate in religion, and the Free Exercise Clause by and large prohibits the government from preventing people from practicing their religion."
Social Studies,"Those two things work together to enable everyone to worship God in accordance with their own conscience. - [Kim] Interesting. So you mentioned a little bit about freedom of the press, but there are two other aspects of the First Amendment: the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government of a redress of grievances."
Social Studies,"So what is included with the right to peaceably assemble? Are there any situations where that might be restricted? - [Erwin] The Supreme Court has said that under freedom of speech, there's a right to use government property for speech purposes. This is also something that tells the freedom of assembly. The Supreme Court has said there's certain government properties that the government is required to make available for speech: sidewalks and parks."
Social Studies,"There's other places where the government has more latitude to regulating speech: school facilities, evenings and weekends. There's places where the government can close entirely to speech: military bases, areas outside prisons and jails. All of these cases could have been litigated under freedom of assembly. Some of the earlier cases explicitly mentioned freedom of assembly, but subsequent cases combined freedom of assembly into the protection of freedom of speech."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] I guess that makes sense, But what about something like a march, for example, that might, say, block traffic. That's perhaps a clear case when there is this tension between freedom of speech and assembly and say, public safety, if they're blocking, say, an ambulance."
Social Studies,"How do you resolve that tension? - [Michael] Sometime in roughly the 1970s, the Court began using a quite different way of looking at the free speech question, in which they said that laws which regulate or prohibit speech on the basis of the content of the speech are, generally speaking, unconstitutional, absent a very important governmental purpose. But the laws that are content neutral, and regulate speech from a basis of it's time, place, or manner are permitted."
Social Studies,"So the basic idea here is the government has regulatory authority over speech, but not over what you say. Just over when you say it, where you say it, how you say it. - [Kim] So, the last thing in the First Amendment is the phrase ""petitioning the government ""for a redress of grievances."" Congress shall make no law abridging that freedom."
Social Studies,What does this mean? How would one petition the government for a redress of grievances? - [Erwin] There are of course many ways that people can petition government for redress of grievances. It's the ability to go and testify before our legislative body. It's the ability to communicate with one's leglislators or representatives about change. It's basically the ability to go to the government and ask it to change its policy.
Social Studies,"There are relatively few cases just about the right to petition government for redress of grievances. Again, I think the reason for that is, it's been so subsumed into the protection of freedom of speech. Everything one would do by way of petitioning government for redress of grievances is through speech and expression, and so the larger protection of speech and expression has meant that the Court hasn't needed to focus so much on this particular right."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Is there anything that you feel people commonly misunderstand about the First Amendment, what it encompasses and what it does not? - [Erwin] One of the most important misunderstandings about this First Amendment, is that people fail to realize that it, like all rights in the Constitution, apply only to the government. Before I took my current job, I was a professor at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Duke is a private university."
Social Studies,"If while I was there, I had criticized the president of the university, and he would have ordered me fired, I could not have sued him or Duke University for violating my free speech rights. The First Amendment doesn't apply because it's a private university. Now I'm at the University of California, a state university. If I were to give a speech criticizing the president of the university, or the chancellor of my campus, and I was to be fired for doing that, I could sue."
Social Studies,"I would sue, because this is a public university. The First Amendment applies. - [Michael] So I think the really dangerous thing in our times is that many people believe that they have some kind of a right not to hear opinions that they find offensive. Certainly college campuses are filled with controversies of this sort. This is something that our Constitution was designed to prevent. Free speech can inflict offense."
Social Studies,"Sometimes it can be hurtful and insulting, but we as a nation have decided that it is better to put up with that so that we can all be free to express ourselves, to criticize the government, to urge the religious and scientific and artistic ideas that we have. It's more important for all of us to do that than it is to be able to retreat to safe spaces and require other people to shut up."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that the rights protected in the First Amendment derive from the historical context of restricted speech, press, and religion in Europe that the framers wished to avoid in the United States. Freedom of religion includes both the freedom not to participate in religion, and the freedom to practice whatever religion you choose. Freedom of speech extends to all forms of freedom of expression, not just words, but there are limits to what counts as free speech."

Social Studies,"To learn more about the Second Amendment, I talked to two experts. Alan Gura is a lawyer who successfully argued two landmark Second Amendment cases before the Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"Adam Winkler is a professor at UCLA Law, and the author of ""Gunfight: the Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America."" Professor Winkler, why did the framers include an amendment on the right to keep and bear arms? - [Adam] Well, really, there's been some debate over what the meaning of the right to keep and bear arms is, but the most common view, and the view supported by the United States Supreme Court, is that the Second Amendment protects individual liberty, in particular, the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense."
Social Studies,"Back in the founding era, the framers were concerned about self-defense in terms of armed state militias, made up of common citizens who would prevent federal overreach. So the federal government wouldn't be able to run roughshod over the liberties of the people because of these armed state militias. So the Second Amendment was in part about protecting those armed state militias."
Social Studies,"Indeed the fear behind all of the Bill of Rights, was that the Constitution gave the new federal government too much power and the federal government would use that power to inhibit liberty. So that was the self-defense of the founding era."
Social Studies,"- [Alan] When we look at the text, the first thing that people should focus on is the phrase ""the right of the people,"" and, in particular, the word ""the"" before ""right,"" I think that might be actually the most important word in the amendment, because what it tells us, is that the right of the people, which is the subject of this amendment, is a pre-existing right."
Social Studies,"And the fact that this was a pre-existing right tells us that the framers thought that there was something that was out there, in their legal system, that they were preserving against violation, and in fact, that is the case."
Social Studies,"In English law, since well before the Revolution, it had been settled and determined that people had an individual right to have arms for self protection, and this right was understood to enable people to protect themselves both against criminal private violence as well as the right of people to protect themselves against some encroachment upon their liberties by a tyrant or by a misguided king."
Social Studies,"This was a right that the framers were well acquainted with in English law, and they were very perturbed that the British, during the time of the Revolution, were violating this right. There were various instances of the British disarming Americans, obviously in an attempt to keep the colonists from revolting, and in an attempt to prevent them from resisting the king."
Social Studies,"The Battle of Lexington and Concord, of course, which started the Revolution, was nothing but a British march upon the armories in those towns, and the attempt to suppress the right to arms. And so, what you saw was when the time came for a Bill of Rights, you saw five out of seven states propose a Bill of Rights, and the only provisions common in all the demands for a Bill of Rights, were the right to religious freedom and the right to arms."
Social Studies,"Now, the framers were not necessarily concerned about the sort of modern gun control, which is in controversy today. - [Adam] Today we have a different kind of self-defense, we generally think about with the Second Amendment, and that's about individuals defending themselves against criminals. It's a very personal kind of liberty, defending yourself against someone trying to take away your life, your health, your property, the life of your loved ones."
Social Studies,"And one thing that I think to remember is that this kind of change in the meaning of a constitutional amendment over time is very common among our constitutional rights. As we take the underlying principles that are embodied in the text, and we apply them to modern circumstances. - [Kim] What about in this early period with the Articles of Confederation."
Social Studies,"Did state constitutions also protect the right to bear arms? - [Alan] Yes, there were state constitutions that protected the right to bear arms, most notably the Pennsylvania Constitution, Article 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provided ""That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state."" And Vermont's Constitution, the following year, chapter one, article 15 copied that language, and you would see other late 18th century, early 19th century constitutions keep this language, or some version of it, and what you would notice is that this language, of course, talks about the two dimensions of the right to bear arms."
Social Studies,"The people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves, that can only be interpreted as self-defense, and also for the defense of the state, that is, they can use those arms that they individually have and gather together and work to defend the society from some force that's attacking them. - [Kim] This is really fascinating. My background is in U.S. history, and I know that one of the reasons that the framers decided that they needed a Constitution that would change the form of the U.S."
Social Studies,"government from what it had been under the Articles of Confederation, was Shays' Rebellion, when a group of armed farmers from western Massachusetts marched on Springfield. So they had kinda taken their military past as a militia, in the Revolutionary War, and then turned that against the new U.S. government instead of the British government."
Social Studies,"Did the framers have any reservations about trying to protect militias in light of Shays' Rebellion? - [Adam] The founders did have concerns about armed militias, as exemplified by Shays' Rebellion. They were worried about self-proclaimed militias, groups of, basically armed uprisings in disguise, that claimed the mantle of a militia, but were really just troublemakers who were taking up arms. And that was kind of how Shays' Rebellion was thought of at the time."
Social Studies,"And that's why when we think about the Second Amendment, we should focus on that language that the framers were sure to include, which is that the militias must be well regulated, right? So the Second Amendment itself says ""A well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" And so, they understood that there was a militia, common citizens who took up arms to help defend the state and nation."
Social Studies,"But they recognized that the militia must be well regulated, disciplined, orderly, subject to appropriate command. It wasn't a right for any self-proclaimed group of radicals to get together and grab their guns, it was, instead, a right to have an orderly state militia, which was an important source of national defense at the time of the founding era."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, I see that the Second Amendment and the Third Amendment, which bans the government from quartering soldiers in people's houses, both reflect fears about standing armies, and also the dangers of having very strong government military power."
Social Studies,"Today we have a very strong government military power, and a standing army, so to what extent are those concerns still relevant today? - [Alan] Well those concerns are still relevant today, we're very blessed in America that we have a long tradition of civilian control over the military, and in our culture the military has not been used to suppress the people, that's not been our experience, but it has been the experience, sadly, in many other places, including through today."
Social Studies,"Now, what the Second Amendment reflects is the notion that the government should not have a monopoly on force. There has to be some means that people might still retain the ability to act, to defend themselves, whether that's against a private individual, felon, miscreant, or whether it's against something more nefarious. - [Adam] Our understanding of what's necessary for national defense is very different than it was in the founding era, because our society is so much different."
Social Studies,"We don't have militias of ordinary citizens the way we once did, back in the founding era, and we don't have troops occupying peoples' homes the way the founders did. But nonetheless, I think the Second and Third Amendment both have principles embodied in that text that remain relevant for today, and should not be thought of as dead letters just because the particular concerns that gave rise to them no longer remain our concerns. Because the principles they embody are more important and more enduring."
Social Studies,"- [Alan] We have been blessed with peaceful transitions of power, with a vibrant democracy, perhaps, at least some aspect of our happy experience, relative to those of our friends and ancestors in Europe, is that we do have a culture that includes the widespread private arms. And that may have a beneficial effect in making sure that everybody plays by the rules and observes normal political conventions and norms."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So what are some of the major Supreme Court cases that have shaped our understanding of the Second Amendment? - [Adam] The first one was a case called ""United States versus Miller,"" that arose in the 1930s. In Miller, you had a situation where an individual was a gangster and he was caught with a sawed off shotgun, which at the time, and still now, does require a special tax stamp that Mr. Miller did not have, and he argued that the Second Amendment secured his right to this weapon."
Social Studies,"The government took the case to the Supreme Court, and at the conclusion of the somewhat confused opinion, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the district court for a determination as to whether or not the sawed off shotgun was an arm of the type whose possession is protected by the Second Amendment. Subsequently, Mr. Miller was murdered, so perhaps he needed a gun of some kind, after all, but we never got the answer to that question."
Social Studies,"So I would read that case, as other people do, and say ""Look, obviously the Supreme Court thought there was some individual right to arms."" If the court had held that there was no individual right to arms, it would have been a much simpler opinion, they would have just said so and that would've been the end of the matter. But instead, because more evidence was needed relating to whether or not this was an arm of the type that Mr. Miller could possess, that shows that there was some right there, at issue."
Social Studies,"Much more helpful, of course, is the case that I argued in the Supreme Court, D.C. versus Heller, which was a coherent, detailed fully briefed and exhaustively opined matter which struck down various Washington, D.C. gun control laws. The main laws at issue in Heller were a District of Columbia law that banned the possession of all handguns by people, effectively. And also, a law that prohibited people from having operative firearms in their home."
Social Studies,"You can have a long gun, a rifle or a shotgun, in your home in D.C., but you could never render that operational, for use as self defense inside your home. Oddly enough, you could use it in self defense in a place of business, just not at your home. - [Adam] The most important case on the Second Amendment is District of Columbia against Heller, where the court held, for the very first time, that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms and struck down a gun control law."
Social Studies,"That was a very important case, a landmark ruling, that has led to many, many, many court cases challenging the constitutionality of a wide number of gun control laws. The Supreme Court has not again stepped into the Second Amendment, with one exception, the court in a case called ""McDonald versus City of Chicago"" held that the Second Amendment applied equally to the federal government and to the state and local governments."
Social Studies,"One thing to remember about our constitutional rights is that they don't automatically apply to the state and local governments. But the McDonald case held that the Second Amendment, and the principles of the Second Amendment nonetheless apply to the states, as well. And that's pretty common as well, over the course of the 20th century the Supreme Court has held that nearly all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply equally to the state and local governments."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] How about limits on the Second Amendment? I mean, I couldn't own a tank, right? What sort of limits may the government place on the right to keep and bear arms? - [Alan] Well, the Second Amendment, like other rights, has some limitations. The first limitations are, of course, as with all rights, given to us by the scope of the actual rights. There are many things that simply aren't included in a particular right."
Social Studies,"The right of free speech, for example, guarantees you the right to speak in some ways, but perjury of speech, terroristic threats or speech, extortion is a form of speech, none of those are traditionally protected. And likewise, there are going to be some arms that are going to fall outside of Second Amendment protection. The Heller case tells us how to go about discovering those limits."
Social Studies,"The Amendment, we are told, presupposes that people will have arms that people would expect to find in common use for traditional, lawful purposes."
Social Studies,"And so, while a handgun or a rifle is a type of arm that people would keep for self defense, for hunting, for sport; a tank or a bazooka is usually not something that you would wish to access for some traditional, recognized, lawful activity, right? I mean, very few people would use a tank to defend themselves against a mugger on the street, right? - [Adam] I mean, as a matter of practicality, even if we didn't have a Second Amendment, there's no possible way we're going to disarm the entire civilian population."
Social Studies,"So, the guns are here to stay. The question is how can we exist with civilian armament and good and effective gun control? And I think that history and tradition can provide some of those answers. In the same way that we try to understand what does the text of the Constitution mean, and what are the principles that that text embodies, we look to history and tradition, how have Americans lived under that Constitution, over these 200-odd years."
Social Studies,We should also look to that history and tradition in seeing the limits of those constitutional rights. And one thing I think is very clear from the history and tradition of gun rights and gun regulation is that there's ample room to regulate firearms.
Social Studies,"The founding fathers had gun control laws, we had gun control laws in the wild west, even though that was the heart of America's gun culture, we've had gun control laws all through American history, and they're part of the story of the Second Amendment, as much as the six-shooter and the right to bear arms."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that the framers' concern over protecting the right to bear arms originated in the experiences of the American Revolution, in which militias played a central role in winning independence for the United States. But a lot has changed since the Revolution. The U.S. military has grown, and arms have gotten a lot more powerful. Alan Gura suggests that the lack of a government monopoly on force is a key component of the peaceful transitions of power that characterize American democracy."
Social Studies,"Adam Winkler, however, argues that there's always been some form of gun control in the United States, even in the wild west. To learn more about the Second Amendment, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"This amendment clearly draws its inspiration from the Quartering Acts that caused a great deal of tension between the American colonies and Great Britain leading up to the American Revolution. But does it have any relevance to our lives today? To learn more, I sought out the help of two experts. Jay Wexler is a Professor of Law at Boston University School of Law specializing in Constitutional Law and the Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"Glenn Reynolds is the Beauchamp Brogan Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Tennessee College of Law. So Professor Reynolds, why did the framers feel it was necessary to put this amendment in the Bill of Rights? - [Glenn] Well, we don't think of quartering of troops in people's homes as a very big issue these days, and of course, some people would say that's because the Third Amendment's worked perfectly. If only the rest of the Bill of Rights worked so well."
Social Studies,"But it was a big issue for the framers because it had happened a lot. To the framers, the English civil wars of the 17th century were recent history, and their attitudes were very much shaped by that. And the Stuart kings, in particular, used quartering of troops as a way to punish towns and areas that they didn't like. The soldiers back then were basically jail sweepings. They had a tendency to steal and to rape and to get into fights even with the people they were quartered with."
Social Studies,"So to have troops quartered upon a town was a way of sort of mass punishment, and that made the English rather unhappy. And after the Glorious Revolution, they banned the practice in England, but they did not ban it in the colony."
Social Studies,"- [Jay] The king had quartered troops in the private homes in the colonies in what became the United States for a long time before the Revolution, since at least 1670 and, as it's easy to imagine, this caused a lot of tension between the homeowners in the colonies and the British troops. And then it got even worse as we found ourselves in the French and Indian War in the 1750s and 1760s. 'Cause nobody wants the government to put troops in their house."
Social Studies,"The house is the place where people live their most private lives, and to have the government come in and then say, here, the soldiers are gonna live here with you now, is something that, understandably, the colonists were very worried about and didn't like very much."
Social Studies,"So, things got worse in the 1760s, when England passed the first Quartering Act, which basically required that colonies had to provide barracks for the king's troops and if there weren't barracks, then the soldiers were authorized to live in inns and alehouses and houses, this is right from the Act itself, selling rum and brandy and strong water."
Social Studies,"And then, if there weren't enough of those around, they could live in private buildings, uninhabited houses and barns and things like this and then that requirement resulted, in part, in the Stamp Act of 1765 which led then to the Tea Party, which everybody knows about, and the Tea Party really made the king angry."
Social Studies,"After that, the king passed, or the parliament passed the second Quartering Act of 1774 which required colonists to allow the king's troops to live in their homes which was, of course, something that the colonists absolutely couldn't stand. So, when we got our independence, it was one of the most important goals of the framers to make sure that this kind of thing could not happen."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, what was so problematic about the possibility of having a soldier quartered in your home, or multiple soldiers quartered in your home? - [Jay] Well, some of us don't particularly like having house guests in general, (chuckling) but they're not house guests. I mean, the problem is, troops back then were not like, we think of soldiers today in the American army, it's hard to get in the army."
Social Studies,"You know, people try to get in the army and they're told, go away, your grades aren't good enough and you're not smart enough. And if you have a criminal record, they don't want you. It wasn't like that back then. Warfare was bloody and awful. The troops stood in masses a hundred yards from each other and blasted away with these Brown Bess muskets. Actually the most common injury then was when pieces of the soldier next to you were driven into you, jawbone and stuff like that."
Social Studies,"So, it was pretty nasty and the discipline that it took to make people do that was pretty harsh and it wasn't very appealing to the better sort, so, literally, a lot of these soldiers were people who would sent there straight from jail. So, they were not very nice people to have living in your house and they didn't have a very good attitude when they did."
Social Studies,"- [Jay] I think they were widely viewed as being cruel, as being unfriendly, maybe even drunk a lot, but it was certainly not the case that they were making their own beds and cleaning up after their dinner and such like that. So, they were not guests. So, they were people who were living in the houses, taking liberties any way they wanted and making a basically a nuisance of themselves, for sure."
Social Studies,"So, I mean, imagine if some soldier you didn't know and you didn't invite into your house was all of a sudden staying in your living room, and then multiply that by however many soldiers it might be, 10, who knows, living in your living room while you're trying to carry out the daily tasks of your life and talking with your children and making plans about dinner and can you imagine how offensive that would be and how problematic that would be to have the government's troops hanging out in your living room."
Social Studies,"It would be pretty awful, so it's no surprise that the framers, I think, objected to this and put this amendment into the Constitution."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, do you think that the Quartering Act of 1774, do you think that was the straw that broke the camel's back in the American Revolution? Was it that living with soldiers was so noxious that it propelled the colonists over the edge into the Revolution? - [Jay] Well, there were a lot of straws that broke that camel's back so it's hard to say which one, but I think one of the things that the colonists hated about it was that they were being subjected to a rule that didn't apply in England and one of things they revolted for, remember, was they thought they'd been deprived of what they called the rights of Englishmen and this was just another example of the crown feeling free to do things in the colonies that he wouldn't do at home and that sent a signal to the colonists that you're not as important, you're not full blown citizens, we don't care about you as much and you don't have the same rights."
Social Studies,And I think that was what was intolerable about it.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this seems like an amendment that has this very specific historical background, but how does this kind of play forward into the future? Was there any danger that there might be later quartering of soldiers after the framing of the Constitution? - [Jay] Well, there was always the risk, there was always the risk that even in the independent United States that the government might, at some point, require homeowners to put up soldiers and, in fact, there is some evidence that during the Civil War this happened."
Social Studies,"I think the evidence is a little foggy, but there is certainly a suggesting in the literature that the Union government required homeowners to put up Union troops. And so, it could have been a problem. It's not something that has, in fact, turned into a huge issue over time, which might say something about how successful the Third Amendment has been in our history."
Social Studies,"But, it was always a risk and I think it was never far from the minds of the framers, this possibility that the government might decide to put its soldiers into people's private homes."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] I think, at the time of the Revolution and when the framers were putting together the Constitution, they had a real fear of standing armies, right? They didn't want a standing army in the United States and, in fact, there wasn't one in the United States at all, a professional army until after the Civil War, I believe. And now we see a standing army, a very large standing army of the United States as being pretty normal."
Social Studies,"How do you think the Third Amendment shows how our ideas of standing armies have changed over time? - [Glenn] You know, one historian said that our framers had an almost panic fear of standing armies and that was based, again, on the history of the English civil wars in the 17th century where standing armies, the tradition was, the king would disarm people he didn't like and then use the army against them and that was seen as very bad, the standing armies were seen as somebody whose loyalty, who paid them, not to the country."
Social Studies,"I think our army has had a different trajectory. I mean, really we didn't have a large standing army in the United States on a regular basis until after World War II. So, I think we're just less afraid of it because our army has been more professional, maybe because we feel like the army is more loyal to citizens than it is to who pays it. Or maybe because we've just lost, perhaps, a vital edge of paranoia that the framers had."
Social Studies,- [Kim] Has there ever been a Supreme Court case that ruled based on the Third Amendment? - [Glenn] There's a single federal court of appeals case called Engblomb against Carey where the federal court of appeals applied the Third Amendment in a New York prison riot case where guards were pushed out of their barracks and National Guardsmen were put in. But the Supreme Court's never done it. But the Supreme Court has relied on the Third Amendment.
Social Studies,"In fact, one of the most famous cases of the second half of the 20th century from the Warren Court was Griswold against Connecticut. That was actually a case striking down laws against birth control."
Social Studies,"- [Jay] Which is one of the forerunners to Roe vs Wade and in that case, the Supreme Court was trying to figure out if the Constitution encompassed a right to privacy and Justice Douglass wrote this opinion which said that there were kind of penumbras or emanations from a variety of amendments in the Bill of Rights, the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment, and importantly, the Third Amendment, that suggested that the Constitution does protect privacy rights to some degree."
Social Studies,"That was kind of the high point for the Third Amendment in Supreme Court history and even in the cases that followed the Griswold decision, which found, for example, the right to an abortion, et cetera, the Court did not rely on that Third Amendment penumbra theory. So, it was one case the Supreme Court cited the Third Amendment as being the source of a sort of enigmatic privacy right. Other than that, the Supreme Court has really not touched the Third Amendment ever."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, there's kind of a suggestion of the right to privacy that goes along with the Third Amendment and also, perhaps, the Fourth Amendment. Do you think that's the way that the Third Amendment is, perhaps, most relevant to us now? - [Glenn] Well, it could be."
Social Studies,"I mean, there's been some thought, there've been some law review articles and other speculation on this that, for example, when the government installs spyware on your computer at home, that's the equivalent of quartering troops in your house because somebody is inside your house spying on you and breaking the privacy, sort of like having to have a soldier at home."
Social Studies,"No court's held that, as far as I know, but it's not crazy and there have been a few other cases more on point where people claim that when police SWAT teams took over their homes to look down on the neighbors and such, that that was troop quartering, but courts so far have said that that's not the same thing since they're not actually sleeping there. - [Jay] One possibility is to say, hey, the Third Amendment really plays no role."
Social Studies,"The courts don't talk about it, nobody really knows much about what it says. And so it's really not important. On the other hand, you could argue, and I'd suggest that this is probably a plausible argument, that, in fact, the Third Amendment has done a lot. The fact that you don't see cases about quartering of troops may very well indicate how well the Third Amendment is serving. So, the Third Amendment just is quiet but that's because it's doing its job so well."
Social Studies,"And that nobody comes and tries to quarter troops in there, in anybody's houses and if they did, they would immediately lose. So, you could argue from that perspective that the Third Amendment is one of the most powerful and well working amendments that we have in the Constitution."
Social Studies,One thing that's interesting about the Constitutional history is that sometimes we see parts of the Constitution that have been dormant for a really long time all of a sudden pop up into consciousness either because the courts have started reading them differently or because the facts of the world change and so all of a sudden the amendment or other Constitutional provision seems relevant.
Social Studies,"And that could potentially happen with the Third Amendment and what I would site here are two developments in the world. One is that we see these days the police becoming more militarized and so it looks kind of like the police are soldiers in a way when they come all armed and with their, and armored vehicles and such."
Social Studies,"And the second phenomenon is kind of the increased surveillance that we're seeing from the government into private phone conversations, private computer files, and things like that, and so it's possible that we, a court at some point, might think that the government is violating if not the letter, but then the spirit of the Third Amendment by basically engaging in the 21st century version of quartering by monitoring people's communications within the home in a kind of militaristic way."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, we've learned that the Third Amendment prevents the government from quartering soldiers in the homes of American citizens and that, in fact, it does such a good the Supreme Court has only made one decision using the Third Amendment as its primary basis. But, the Third Amendment's implied guarantee of privacy in the home may come to be more important as we debate the limits of government surveillance of our computers."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Third Amendment, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"It says, ""This right of the people to be secure ""in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, ""against unreasonable searches and seizures, ""shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, ""but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, ""and particularly describing the place to be searched, ""and the persons or things to be seized."" To learn more about the the Fourth Amendment, I talked to two law professors who specialize in criminal law, Professor Tracey Meares of Yale University and Professor Orin Kerr of George Washington University, and he's a particular expert in criminal procedure and computer crime."
Social Studies,"Professor Kerr, can you tell us a little bit about what the Fourth Amendment is and why the Framers were interested in protecting these rights in particular? - [Orin] The Fourth Amendment is a ban on unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. It's something the Framers were interested in because they wanted to limit the government's power."
Social Studies,"At the time of the framing, the English King had engaged in some pretty bad things that the Framers wanted to stop, and one of those was raiding people's homes with what was called a general warrant. A general warrant was basically a warrant that said the police could go anywhere and look for anything without any limit. - [Kim] I asked Professor Meares to explain a little bit more about general warrants. She's a professor at Yale Law School who specializes in criminal procedure and criminal law policy."
Social Studies,"- [Tracey] They were a general warrant allowing these officials to search people's homes, places, papers, the kinds of things that the Fourth Amendment lists in ways that people thought was not okay. The Fourth Amendment was primarily concerned with a couple of things. One: a case involving a seditious libel investigation. It's a case called Entick."
Social Studies,"And a warrant was issued authorizing Entick, that's the subject of the warrant, his arrest, and the seizure of all of his books and papers so that he could be prosecuted for seditious libel."
Social Studies,"That case isn't as well-known as the second case, which is called the Writs of Assistance case, and basically, the Writs of Assistance involved customs inspectors who were trying to crack down on smuggling that was affecting Boston's economy, so to add in that task, inspectors used writs of assistance that were issued by the king and authorized the inspectors both to draft assistance, hence the name ""writs of assistance,"" and to search any place where smuggled goods might be concealed."
Social Studies,"- [Orin] The Framers wanted to put an end to that and so they said, ""No general warrants are allowed,"" and searches and seizures have to be reasonable. That really means is the government can't just stop anyone, arrest anyone, break into someone's house. There are limits as to what the government can do. - [Kim] But what are those limits? What determines probable cause for a search and what renders a search and seizure unreasonable? - [Orin] Yeah, what counts as unreasonable is a really big question."
Social Studies,"There are different answers different courts have suggested, but the basic idea is that first if the government has a valid warrant, a search or a seizure is reasonable. If the warrant, if a judge has signed off and said, ""Yeah, the government has probable cause ""to search this place for particular evidence,"" then the government can do that. And then the Supreme Court has laid out a bunch of what they call exceptions to the warrant requirement, which are also reasonable searches."
Social Studies,"So for example, if a person consents to a search, that's reasonable. Or in the case of a car, a car can be searched without a warrant based on probable cause. That's called the automobile exception. There are rules that govern when the police can stop somebody temporarily. When the government needs an arrest, they need probable cause. There are basically all sorts of rules that the Supreme Court has laid out on a bunch of different cases that say what counts as an unreasonable search or seizure."
Social Studies,"The Supreme Court has said that probable cause means a fair probability that evidence will be found in a particular place or that a particular person committed a crime, and ""fair probability"" is the language, but that's not something the Supreme Court has said. You know, that's not 50%. That doesn't mean it's more probable than not. It just means that there's pretty good reason to think that there's evidence to be in a particular place or that a particular person committed a crime."
Social Studies,"So it doesn't mean a hunch, it doesn't mean the officer just had the idea pop into his head, but it also doesn't mean that the officer's certain. There's just got to be a pretty good reason, but not certainty, to think that that person committed a crime or there's evidence there. - [Kim] But when I asked Professor Meares the same question, she wasn't convinced it was so easy to tell what counts as probable cause."
Social Studies,"So what counts as a true probable cause to issue a warrant upon? (Tracey sighs) (Kim laughs) Sorry. We can just skip this instead. - [Tracey] Let's take a second. I mean, I taught this today. You can't, these aren't questions that you can just simply answer. No one can actually. I mean, there is, I mean literally, I taught today the fact that there is no real law on what probable cause is. It's inherently a factual determination."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So how does this work in practice? I asked Professor Kerr if it's the case that a police officer has to convince a judge that there's probable cause to issue a warrant. - [Orin] Yes, that can come up in two ways. In some cases, the Supreme Court says the police have to go to a judge first and get a warrant and then they have to convince the judge that what they're about to do is based on probable cause."
Social Studies,"And other cases come up when the government has searched first or arrested first and then they come back with the evidence or come back with the person who was arrested and then there's a hearing as to whether there was probable cause for the arrest that already occurred, so either way the standards are the same. It's that fair probability idea, ultimately up to a judge whether the police were right or wrong in doing what they did."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, so there is a little bit of prior legwork involved in some cases. What happens in cases when it might be really important to get evidence, say if there's a bomb threat? - [Orin] So there are some rules that allow searches or seizures without a warrant under what they call exigent circumstances. That basically means there is an emergency, so the government had to act without a search warrant."
Social Studies,"And so if there is a ticking time bomb that they think is gonna go off in a package and they've got good reason to think there is this ticking time bomb in the package, they don't have to say, ""Hey, we're gonna go find a judge,"" because by the time they do that, the bomb might have gone off. They can search that package under this exigent circumstances idea."
Social Studies,"So that's an exception to the rules, although beyond that, there is no difference between a serious case and a less serious case under the Fourth Amendment. They're kind of all serious cases, so the courts have to follow and the police have to follow the same rules in less serious and more serious cases. - [Kim] Professor Meares gave me an example of what seemed like a less serious case, but it's still a really interesting example of what counts as an unreasonable search and seizure."
Social Studies,"- [Tracey] I'll give you one more case that I'm sure the high school students will love, and my students love it. It's a case where a person was sitting in a noddle shop in front of a window eating a big bowl of noodles, clear soup with noodles, and a police officer walks by the person eating the noddles and notices something floating in the bowl of noodles."
Social Studies,"So he enters into the store where the person is eating the noodles and the person has left temporarily the bowl of noodles to get a napkin or go to the bathroom or something. And then the police officer approaches the bowl, picks up the person's spoon and stirs the noodles to see if he can find anything and some baggies of crack float to the top. Did the person have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their food? - [Kim] In their soup? - [Tracey] In their soup."
Social Studies,"(Kim laughs) - [Kim] How did they rule? - [Tracey] They ruled that the stirring was a search. So if it is a search, and i.e., that you have a subjective interest of privacy in your soup that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable, then the police officer would have to get a warrant before stirring the soup. - [Kim] This raises the question."
Social Studies,"Where I have Fourth Amendment rights? Are some locations protected and not others? - [Orin] The building block of the Fourth Amendment is really that you have Fourth Amendment rights in your home, in your pockets, in your packages, but you don't have Fourth Amendment rights outside. You don't have Fourth Amendment rights in what you're doing outside or if the police want to walk on what they call open fields, public streets, that, you don't have Fourth Amendment rights in that."
Social Studies,"So thinking about how the Fourth Amendment applies just in the physical world, if the police want to break into your home, they need a search warrant. If the police want to watch you walk down the street, they don't need anything. It's not a search or a seizure, so they can do anything they want, just watching you. If they want to arrest you, they need probable cause to believe you've committed a crime. So those are really the building blocks of the Fourth Amendment going back to 18th-century technology."
Social Studies,"And then the big question becomes, ""All right. Well, how do you update that to a modern world?"" - [Tracey] It's also the case that the Fourth Amendment applies to seizures, so what police have to show before they arrest a person or temporarily stop them, or briefly pat their body on the outside of their body for weapons. All of those questions are Fourth Amendment questions, as are questions involving how much force police actually use to effect the arrest once we've decided that an arrest is legitimate."
Social Studies,"So we haven't talked about any of those questions but the Fourth Amendment governs all of that and remember, the Fourth Amendment governs all of those topics in a context in which the Framers' motivations for enacting the Fourth Amendment have absolutely nothing to do with most of those things I just mentioned. - [Kim] But the Fourth Amendment also has implications that go beyond warrants and seizures. Professor Meares thinks that one of the biggest Fourth Amendment issues today is discretion."
Social Studies,"- [Tracey] Many people have thought much more about how the Fourth Amendment protects privacy than how the Fourth Amendment addresses discretion. - [Kim] And by discretion in this case, you mean what they get to decide to do on their own, right? - [Tracey] Exactly so. And one way to see the difference between those two things is to think about a metal detector in an airport. So long as everyone is required to go through the metal detector, there is no law enforcement discretion involved."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this is kind of where the public safety aspect comes in, that if we're all subject to non-invasive procedures at the whim of police, it's a little different than if individuals are kind of plucked for that reason? - [Tracey] Right, that it's just pointing out that targeting, the targeting of people for invasions is a different problem than the invasion problem itself, right? And so if all we ever do is think about privacy invasion without thinking about the discretion problem, then we're missing something important."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] For Professor Kerr however, the most important issue at stake today regarding the Fourth Amendment is how it will apply to electronic media. - [Orin] Well, the big question I think is how the Fourth Amendment is gonna apply to searches and seizures of computers, of emails, to the internet, new technologies that we all use every day."
Social Studies,"We wake up in the morning and hop online or go on Twitter or whatever you use online, lots and lots of communications online all around the world, and how does the Fourth Amendment apply to that is something that the courts are beginning to answer but they've only started to answer. Some really, really hard questions of kind of translating that physical world concept of the Fourth Amendment to the world of computers that we live today."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, as we've learned, the Fourth Amendment ensures that government authorities can't raid homes, pockets, or papers without a warrant issued by a judge, and then only if there is a probable cause to believe there is a reason for a search. What's tricky is deciding what counts as probable cause and whether it's discriminatory to select some people to search, but not others."
Social Studies,"And how do we translate the Fourth Amendment to a world where our papers are all digital? Should the police be permitted to search our cell phones, our browsing histories, our private social media profiles? You can learn more about the Fourth Amendment by checking out the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"Donald Dripps is the Warren Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of San Diego School of Law. And Steven Saltzburg is the Wallace and Beverly Woodbury University Professor of Law at George Washington Law School. So, Professor Saltzburg could you talk a little bit about why the framers were interested in choosing to protect these rights in particular? - [Saltzburg] The fifth amendment really addresses four different things."
Social Studies,"One, it says that generally you can't be charged with a serious crime unless you're indicted by a grand jury. Two, it says you can't be subjected to double jeopardy. Three, it says you can't be compelled to be a witness against yourself. And four, there is this due process right, not to be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process."
Social Studies,"If you look at it, the three provisions, the grand jury provision, double jeopardy, and the privilege against self-incrimination all have a common history and that is that in England there was a time in which the crown, the King, basically tried to assert power to bringing people to trial for charges that the King wanted brought. And the grand jury served as a protection between the King and ordinary people."
Social Studies,"- [Dripps] Most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights are aimed at preventing the recurrence of some specific abuse that had been known to English history. There are different provisions in the fifth amendment that speak to different abuses. The fundamental one and the one that goes furthest back in the legal history, back to Magna Carta and so on is the due process clause."
Social Studies,"And that clause means that no person can be injured by the government except according to the law of the land and after a fair trial. And that in the very, very distant past back in the 13th century King John had an infamous practice of executing supposed rebellious barons and then holding a solemn trial after the drawing and quartering. And so, that notion of judgment before punishment is really, really fundamental. That's what due process is about at its most basic level."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, so can you say more about the due process clause here? What is due process? - [Saltzburg] Due process is an extraordinarily complicated concept. It means that there are certain procedural and substantive rules that must be honored in the way in which governments approach individuals and entities that they are seeking to regulate. It's not a simple bright line that in order to have due process this is what is required. Due process is somewhat flexible."
Social Studies,"It tends to provide more protections when individuals are faced with more serious consequences. So, in terms of criminal law it's generally understood that the most severe penalties that we have that can legally be imposed upon people are the death penalty, prison, and jail. And generally, you can't impose any of those except as punishment for a crime. And so, the due process in the criminal arena is largely defined by the Bill of Rights."
Social Studies,"And some common law understandings that have been carried forward, let me give you a couple of examples. There is nothing in the Constitution that says the government must prove guilt in a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt, but that is a fundamental part of American law. The Supreme Court has held that that is a part of what due process requires and that is the law throughout the United States not withstanding the fact you don't see it in the Constitution."
Social Studies,"Similarly, the right to a unanimous jury in a criminal case is also not found anywhere in the Constitution. - [Kim] You mentioned a grand jury, so how is that different from an ordinary jury? - [Dripps] The grand jury served a very delicate role in Founding era times because many, many prosecutions were brought by private persons."
Social Studies,There were no police forces of the modern paramilitary 24/7 type and a lot of law enforcement was done by self help and prosecutions were privately funded and sometimes lay people would represent themselves pro se in pressing a criminal prosection. And the grand jury was there to make sure that people weren't subjected to vindictive or malicious prosecutions by ill-spirited neighbors and that sort of thing.
Social Studies,"The framers probably had in mind a famous case of the Earl of Shaftesbury who was suspected of misdeeds and a grand jury famously refused to indict him. And so, they sought as one among many checks against the possible abuse of power by this new federal government. - [Saltzburg] So, a grand jury is a body that decides whether or not to bring a charge against an individual or an entity like a corporation."
Social Studies,"The grand jury in federal court happens to be 23 people, but there isn't anything in the constitution that actually says it has to be that number. Unlike a trial by jury which we call a petty jury, the grand jury does not have to be unanimous. It basically decides to bring a charge by majority vote and the grand jury specifically instructed that its job is not to decide guilt or innocence, its job is to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to bring a job."
Social Studies,"Which we usually say means probable cause to believe that a crime was committed and a particular person committed that crime. So the grand jury's function is to bring a charge, the trial jury's function is to then decide guilt or innocence. - [Kim] Interesting, so how about double jeopardy? This is something that I think we have a maybe rudimentary understanding of in popular culture."
Social Studies,"What does double jeopardy really mean? - [Saltzburg] If we didn't have a double jeopardy clause the executive branch, if it could persuade grand jury to charge somebody with a crime, could prosecute that person and if the person was acquitted then government could do it again. Bring the same change and do it again until they got a conviction and that meant that an individual could be persecuted rather than prosecuted by continuing charges for the exact same thing."
Social Studies,"And the basic function of the double jeopardy clause is to basically tell the government, you get one shot. - [Dripps] Trials are very stressful and very expensive, and the government has more resources than the typical defendant does and so one concern is that you would just have the government have power to bankrupt people by retrying the case over and over again. It becomes very, very complicated saying just what the same offense is."
Social Studies,"The current doctrine is that every statutory crime that includes different factual elements than every other statutory crime arising out of the same course of conduct is a separate crime. - [Kim] Are there an exceptions to double jeopardy, or common misconceptions about how it works? - [Saltzburg] Yes, there are two common misconceptions."
Social Studies,"One of them is that you can only be tried once for the same criminal activity and the reason you can actually be prosecuted more than once is because in our system, federal government in each state is considered to be a separate sovereign which means the federal government can charge someone with a crime, let's say a drug conspiracy. The State of Virginia or California can also prosecute for the same criminal conduct. The states have their own criminal law to enforce."
Social Studies,"So technically, someone could be prosecuted let's say by the Commonwealth of Virginia for a drug conspiracy and convicted. And then could be prosecuted again by the federal government or another state for the same criminal activity and be convicted or acquitted and the double jeopardy clause would not be violated. The second thing about double jeopardy is that it only protects you from being prosecuted a second time by the same sovereign for the same crime."
Social Studies,"It doesn't protect you from being prosecuted for a different crime. Suppose the State of California prosecutes a defendant for murder and the defendant is acquitted, the State of California could then bring a second prosecution for a kidnapping of the same victim that actually occurred before the murder. And because that's a different crime, the double jeopardy clause doesn't bar a separate prosecution."
Social Studies,- [Kim] And so there's also a clause here that says an individual shall not be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
Social Studies,"So, this is what we call taking the fifth, right? What does that mean? - [Dripps] So, the fifth amendment privilege is a privilege that can be asserted by anyone who is called to answer by agents of the government and to claim the privilege it has to be the case that the witness is being compelled to speak will suffer adverse consequences if she doesn't answer the questions the government officers want her to answer."
Social Studies,"Those answers have to tend to incriminate the witness and those answers have to be testimonial, that is to say they have to say in some way they constitute witnessing. - [Saltzburg] Good lawyers, good lawyers will generally advise their clients to take the fifth. That is, claim their privilege against self-incrimination almost any time that the government is seriously investigating them."
Social Studies,"And the reason is people's memories are often bad, that when people are asked question they may believe that something happened in a certain way but they haven't gone back to review it. And when people make mistakes, simple mistakes, that are made in response to a question may look like people deliberately lied. They may make someone look like they were attempting to deceive investigators."
Social Studies,"And therefore, when in doubt, individuals who are being investigated have good reason to invoke their privilege against self-incrimination. - [Dripps] Historically, there were two things that the fifth amendment privilege was really supposed to prevent. One was that while the English system relied on grand juries and petty juries and cross examination, confrontational trials, the European system of the Founding era even as late as the end of the 18th century still relied on juridical torture."
Social Studies,"So, if there was a lot of preliminary proof, if it's super probable cause against a suspect in say France or Germany, the judges will authorize to torture the target into confessing. They didn't want to adopt this inquisitorial practices of continental Europe."
Social Studies,"And the other great abuse behind the privilege was the Court of Star Chamber's use of the oath ex officio which was witnesses were called before the Star Chamber without knowing what the investigation was about, whether they were a target, what they were suspected of doing, and the first thing that happened was they were obliged to swear an oath."
Social Studies,"And there was a famous case involving a man named John Lilburne who refused to take the oath and was torturously punished by the Court of Star Chamber for refusing to take that oath they pilloried him and they flogged him, and his case was seen as kind of an example of the kinds of abuses that might be done by asking questions subject to oaths where the answer might incriminate you or expose your to perjury, or expose your soul to eternal consequences."
Social Studies,"So, those two things were behind the privilege against self-incrimination. The Founders didn't want either of those to come back from the past to haunt the new continent. - [Kim] Say that I have committed a crime, what might happen? Are police or investigators required to tell me about my right not to self-incriminate? - [Saltzburg] Starting 1966, in the case that many people have now heard of Miranda versus Arizona."
Social Studies,"The United States Supreme Court held that when a person is in custody, that is generally has been arrested and the investigators or prosecutors want to question the suspect they have to give a series of warnings which are widely known as the Miranda Warnings. In short, they have to say to the suspect, ""You have the right to remain silent. ""Anything you say can and will be used ""against you in a court of law."
Social Studies,"""You have the right to have a lawyer present ""during any questioning, and if you cannot afford a lawyer, ""one will be appointed for you."" - [Dripps] When the suspect is in custody, they have to give the famous Miranda Warning that everybody knows from movies and television and so forth, and that's the one case where the government is required to be proactive."
Social Studies,"In front of a congressional committee or grand jury investigation, or if you're just a witness at a civil trial, and there's a question that might expose you to criminal liability you have to claim the privilege. You have to say, ""I refuse to answer that question ""on the grounds that it may incriminate me."" When the suspect is under arrest and the police wanna question him, they have a different duty."
Social Studies,"They have a duty to proactively give him a warning to make sure that he understands his rights, that he doesn't have to say anything to the police, that what he does say could be admissible against him. - [Kim] So, we've learned that the fifth amendment protects citizens from possible abuses of power by the government when an individual is charged with a crime. It requires a grand jury to determine whether an individual should be indicted for a crime."
Social Studies,Limits the number of times an individual can be tried for the same crime. Protects people from self-incrimination and requires that the government follow fair procedures in prosecuting the law.

Social Studies,"To learn more about the takings clause, I sought out the help of two experts. Richard Epstein is the Laurence A. Tisch professor of law and director of the Classical Liberal Institute at NYU law. He's also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Eduardo Penñalver is the Allan R. Tessler professor and dean of Cornell Law School."
Social Studies,"So Profess Epstein, can you give us a little background, just what is the takings clause? - [Richard] Well there's a rule in constitutional law that the shorter the provision, the more difficult the interpretation and this is a very short petition."
Social Studies,"It says, ""nor shall private property be taken for public use ""without just compensation,"" and the first thing to understand about the clause is that it's in the passive voice so it doesn't tell you who's taking it and early on, since this was part of the Bill of Rights, it was said to apply only to congress and not to the states and then after the Civil War through the 14th Amendment, it was said to apply to the states. So now it applies to both the states and to the federal government."
Social Studies,- [Eduardo] Many constitutions don't have an explicit property protection clause but there is a fairly strong norm around compensating owners of private property when you essentially commandeer their property for public purposes and that seems to have been the motivation.
Social Studies,I think the clearest reading of it is that it's a provision of the Constitution that makes clear that when the federal government takes your property or when the states take your property for some public use that they have to make you whole by giving you just compensation. - [Richard] Private property's a pretty comprehensive term. Everybody understands that it means land and the things you build on land.
Social Studies,"They also understand that it tends to cover chattels, that is things like books and baseballs that you happen to own and wild animals but it's also, it's much broader than that. It covers all sorts of intangible rights like patents, copyrights, trade secrets."
Social Studies,"These are very complicated and generally speaking, the government doesn't have any obligation to create a patent but once it gives you the patent, it just can't take it from you because the patent, after conferred, it is in fact a property right and then it also may or may not cover other kinds of intangibles like good will which is the value associated with a business knowing that your past customers may come back to you in the future."
Social Studies,"- [Eduardo] On the motives of the framers for including this, talk about things like the confiscation, mostly of personal property during the Revolutionary War by the British government that that was possibly a motivation to make clear that if in future scenarios, if the government wanted to take your property, it would have to compensate you."
Social Studies,"Most historians don't think there was a real problem being addressed by this, a problem of uncompensated taking of property by colonial governments during that period or by the state governments during the Articles of Confederation."
Social Studies,"- [Richard] The framers wanted a system of what we'd call limited government and so what the takings clause essentially says is yes we need your land for fort and it's really very important but if we're gonna take it and use it for fort, that's a public use, we're gonna pay you compensation for the fair market value of the land before the fort was put on and this is in order to make sure that you can't pick and choose your victims and it's a way of assuring government regularity. That's the first."
Social Studies,"Second thing is more economic, less apparent at the time of the framing, pretty apparent today, is that the government can take something and not pay you compensation, it's gonna overtake. So your land is worth 100 thousand dollars as a farm but if you're gonna use it for a fort, it's only worth 10 thousand dollars."
Social Studies,"If you don't have to pay the 100 thousand dollars, well you may take it 'cause you get 10 thousand dollars worth of gain but if you have to pay the fair market value of the property interest taking, you won't do it. So essentially what it does is it makes sure or at least improves the odds that when the government does take property, what does regular, it will in fact improve overall social welfare."
Social Studies,So you have a political function dealing with singling out and you have an economic function dealing with the overall improvement of government behavior from an economic point of view.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Okay so say I had a piece of land and the government decided that they wanted it for some purpose, what would be the legal process for the government to go about acquiring my land? - [Eduardo] Well the process for eminent domain really varies by state but typically there's some notice that the government gives you that it intends to take your property."
Social Studies,"The government goes to court and gets an order of condemnation to take title of the property and then often there's a requirement that the government bargained with you about the value of the property. It will tell you what it thinks the value is, the fair market value is the standard that we use for just compensation, that's the value that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller for the land."
Social Studies,It doesn't include things like your sentimental value or anything like that so it's just the market value of the property. There's some back and forth through this required bargaining. If the government and the property owner can't reach an agreement then the government can go to court and get the court to specify the value of the property that will be paid in compensation and then the payment is made and the deed is transferred and the government becomes the owner of the property.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, so the government has gone through this process to try to acquire my land, what if I'm a real holdout and I just really don't want the government to get my land, what happens then? - [Eduardo] Well you can litigate the various pieces of this and again, it depends a little bit on the state law. So some states put more procedural hurdles in the way of the government."
Social Studies,"Other states make it easier for the government but under the Constitution, there are really only two ways you can resist the taking of your property through eminent domain."
Social Studies,"One is by arguing that the use that the government plans to make of your property doesn't count as legitimate public use because the clause says, ""nor shall private property be taken for public use ""without just compensation,"" and that public use language has been interpreted to be a limitation on the power of eminent domain and then you can argue, the second thing you can argue is that what the government is offering you in terms of just compensation is not adequate compensation."
Social Studies,And you can litigate those through the courts and that can slow the process down quite a bit. Some states make it easier for the government by saying well the government can actually just take title while you're litigating and others make you go...
Social Studies,"Allow you to stop the condemnation process and litigate in advance but there's often what's called a quick take procedure which allows the government to move more quickly and put the litigation on the backend but the public use, if it's found, if the use if found not to be public, what you win is an actual prohibition on the taking itself. You keep your property. If you win on the just compensation side, all you get is more money, they still take your property. - [Kim] So you mentioned public use."
Social Studies,"What counts as public use? - [Eduardo] Well under the current law, any use that generates a public benefit is really a public use. The way the court has put it is anything the government, any purpose the government can pursue through any other means, it can pursue through eminent domain. So if the government wants to create jobs or if the government wants to beautify or if the government wants to remove blight, all those things are things that we think it's legitimate for the government to try to do."
Social Studies,"If it can do those things, it can do them through the use of the eminent domain power."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] One thing that strikes me as interesting is just the fact that this clause is in the Fifth Amendment among things like double jeopardy or self-incrimination so why do you think the framers included this particular clause here as opposed to elsewhere in the Bill of Rights? - [Richard] Well that's a great question to which there's no obvious answer but the one clause that is pretty close to it is the due process clause in the Fifth Amendment that says, ""nor shall any person be deprived of life, ""liberty or property without due process of law."" So if you start with the procedural stuff, somebody's gonna say well how do we know that the procedures aren't fair? And if it turns out that the government uses a set of procedures that don't give you adequate notice, you're always going to end up short on the amount of compensation that you're gonna require."
Social Studies,So bad procedures tend to lead to bad outcomes which tend to lead to property being taken at less than full market value. So what happens is is therefore very close linkage between the procedures used under the due process clause and the substantive protection that you have under takings. - [Kim] Any changes in the interpretation of the takings clause by the Supreme Court over time? - [Richard] Well there's been a huge kind of switch up and down and let me put it the following way.
Social Studies,"In the beginning, there wasn't much of anything that was done with respect to the takings clause. The first federal case to deal with it was called Barron against Baltimore in 1833 or so and it just simply said that the clause does not allow for protection of Mr. Barron against the city of Baltimore because it only binds the federal government, it doesn't bind the state."
Social Studies,"After the Civil War, two things happen, a real distinction, the first thing is you start getting comprehensive regulation of the railroads and the rates they can charge and then public utilities and the rates that they can charge. And then in 1921, there's a case called Block v. Hersch and it's a very close 5-4 decision but they sustain on the grounds that it's a wartime, a temporary two year statute that limits the rents that can be charged in Washington D.C. at the end of the first World War."
Social Studies,- [Eduardo] One of the biggest changes in the interpretation of the takings clause was the extension of the takings clause to government situations in which your property was not appropriated by the government.
Social Studies,"So what we call the regulatory takings doctrine which started in with the case of Pennsylvania Coal versus Mayhon in the 1920s and then has now become much more, it was sort of dormant for a while but become much more active since the 1980s, that's a doctrine that says, ""if the government regulates your use of property ""excessively, then the courts can treat that ""in effect as a confiscation of your property ""and require the payment of just compensation."" That's maybe the most significant change in the interpretation of the clause in its history."
Social Studies,"So there continues to be controversy about the public use doctrine on modern commentators, especially libertarians, who want a very narrowly drawn account of public use and disagree with the breadth of the doctrine as I described it to you. So there's a lot of activism around that. There's been some state law that's been enacted to try to raise the floor there."
Social Studies,"The federal definition of public use is just a floor and states can go beyond that and restrict the power of eminent domain more forcefully if they want to and they have. - [Kim] So we've learned that the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment prevents both federal and state governments from taking private property for public use without just compensation but there are a lot of questions about what counts as private property, public use or just compensation."
Social Studies,"In recent years, debate over the takings clause has centered on whether government regulations about how a private individual can use land also constitute a form of compensation and the extent of acceptable public uses for which the government can seize property. To learn more about the Fifth Amendment, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Sixth Amendment, I sought out the help of two experts. Stephanos Bibas is a United States Circuit Judge for the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He's also a leading scholar of criminal procedure. Jeffrey Fisher is Professor of Law and Co-Director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at Stanford Law School."
Social Studies,"So Judge Bibas, in the case of the Bill of Rights, the Framers were trying to prevent particular abuses of the government, so what was the historical background that led them to want to protect these rights in particular? - [Stephanos] In England in the late 17th and early 18th century, there was a series of treason trials, other political trials, and the king had done some things that bypassed the usual mode of trial in criminal cases. The Anglo-American system is known as the Common Law."
Social Studies,"It involves live testimony in open court before a jury of your peers, and the jury ultimately decides did you do it, were you blameworthy, do you deserve the punishment? The Crown had railroaded some of its political opponents."
Social Studies,"People like Sir Walter Raleigh, people accused in the Popish Plots during the strife between Catholics and Protestants and some of these convictions were later understood to have been wrongful ones and so the colonists in England and then in America insisted on protecting against various ways of diminishing or abridging the trial that would be speedy, that would be public, that would be before a jury, that would have an evenly matched prosecution and defense and would have an opportunity to look the witness in the eye and confront him the way it was always done in England as opposed to on continental Europe."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] There's a varied history, primarily in England of certain periods of time where people were prosecuted in ways that the Founders deemed fundamentally unfair. Probably the most notorious example was the Star Chamber."
Social Studies,That was a moniker given to a king-run tribunal decades before the Founding where people were picked up and arrested and then sentenced to criminal punishment and sometimes to death without ever having an opportunity to challenge the charges against them and sometimes not even knowing what the charges were against them. That kind of a travesty of justice and abuse of power was probably the foremost thing in the Framers' minds. - [Stephanos] This was partly for the benefit of the defendant or the accused.
Social Studies,"It also was very importantly about protecting the citizens' right to control criminal justice. That it wasn't the king who would do this, and the king couldn't just let his royal officers off. It's very important to look at the Declaration of Independence. A bunch of the complaints in the Declaration are complaints that the king is bypassing these usual modes, that he's protecting his soldiers by a mock trial from punishment for murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of the States."
Social Studies,That he's depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury and that he has made the judges subject to his manipulation and pleasure because they don't have stable salaries. The colonists were very suspicious of the king's manipulation of criminal justice.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So how does the Sixth Amendment inform how the US legal system works today? - [Jeffrey] The first important thing to understand is that when the Sixth Amendment was drafted, just like all the other first ten amendments, they applied primarily only to the federal government not to state governments, but in the sixties and seventies the Supreme Court applied all of these rights one-by-one to the states."
Social Studies,Now because the rights apply to both the federal government and to state governments the Sixth Amendment applies every single time somebody is charged with a crime.
Social Studies,"That starts with knowing what you're being charged with, whether it's by what's known as a grand jury indictment or some other method of accusing somebody of committing a crime, and it continues on with the right to an attorney to represent the accused and goes all the way through the decision-making process with how the jury decides whether to convict or not - [Kim] This is fascinating, but there are a couple things that I see in the Sixth Amendment that seem like they might be a little difficult to define, particularly the idea of a speedy trial."
Social Studies,"What actually counts as speedy? - [Stephanos] The speedy trial component is not well-defined. The Supreme Court has ultimately said, ""Well, we're gonna balance a bunch of factors. How long is the delay? What's the reason for the delay? Has the defendant shown any prejudice from the delay? How long did it take after the defendant requested the speedy trial?"" Very rarely does the court actually throw out a case based on that."
Social Studies,"What happens more often is that the defendant makes a request and then judges really try to push the case along to be faster. The court has turned it into really focusing on the defendant's interest in something fast, and that matters a lot when a defendant doesn't make bail and is being held in jail pending trial. Those cases will go to trial in a matter of months. A case where someone is out on bail can easily take a year or two before it ultimately proceeds to trial."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] What's speedy or what's reasonable in 1791 might not be speedy or reasonable in 2017. What the courts have said with respect to speedy is there's not a bright line rule, say, one year, five years, whatever it might be that somebody has to be brought to trial after being charged."
Social Studies,"Rather, what the court does is it considers how diligently the prosecution has tried to pursue the case in light of other factors such as the complexity of the case, whether the defendant himself wants the case to go to trial soon or whether the defendant himself has agreed to certain delays or said that he doesn't mind them, and whether there's prejudice that has occurred which is a legal way of saying whether somebody's been harmed or injured by the delay."
Social Studies,"Say for example a key witness has now died or fled the jurisdiction. Flexible words like speedy in essence translate some measure of discretion and flexibility to the courts. - [Kim] Why is our legal process so much slower than it was in the 18th century? - [Stephanos] That connects up to the second set of rights we've constructed around what makes something a public trial. One of the main things there is the jury right. Juries in the 18th century, we didn't have a jury selection process."
Social Studies,"The first 12 people who didn't know the plaintiff or the defendant or the victim or whoever it was would be empaneled and they would serve all day and they'd hear all the cases that came that day. You didn't have lawyers involved in most of these cases. Usually it was the victim against the defendant himself or herself, no lawyer speaking for either side, that was the norm. The defendant had a right to hire a lawyer but usually couldn't afford it and didn't. There weren't rules of evidence."
Social Studies,"There weren't complicated motions. There weren't technical jury instructions. The trials themselves took, as I said an hour, two hours. Pre-trial proceedings did not involve lots of legal motions 'cause there were no lawyers to run them. The judges themselves often didn't have legal training. There were no law schools in America."
Social Studies,"When you have a system like that, it's not that cumbersome there's very little incentive to bypass it, and you don't have professional lawyers who are looking to get this case done with and get on to the next case or who have seen enough cases that they can bargain back and forth and strike a bargain for this case that's about where the previous cases came out. You didn't have an incentive for plea bargaining, it wasn't slow enough."
Social Studies,"You didn't have the experts who it would take to run plea bargaining and you didn't have the lack of investment in your own case that makes plea bargaining possible or the technical rules. These cases actually all did go to juries and the expectation was they all would go to juries and the jury right wasn't just a right of a defendant, this happened in every case 'cause the public had a right to do justice itself as well as seeing justice done. - [Kim] I have so many questions about this."
Social Studies,"For one thing, do you think our current system is an improvement on this older system of juries and not so much plea bargaining, and also why is there so much plea bargaining today? - [Jeffrey] At the time of the Founding, there were no deals to be made short of a full trial."
Social Studies,"That's a huge contrast with today where over 90% of criminal cases in this country are not resolved by trial but rather by what's called a plea bargain which is a defendant coming in and saying, ""Look, I will plead guilty to a lesser offense, or to the same offense you're charging but with a guarantee of lesser punishment as long as you don't require me to go through a full trial."" The idea is, is that because the system has grown so large and there are so many cases, that it's a relief to the prosecution and the court system not to have to have a trial in every case and the benefit to the defendant is that he gets a slightly better deal or is able to plead to a lesser crime."
Social Studies,"- [Stephanos] Over the course of the 19th century prosecutors are really taking over most of these cases. It goes from a few percent to the lion's share of cases, and then defense lawyers get hired more and more to counteract that. Once you got prosecutors and defense lawyers on both sides, and the Sixth Amendment guarantees you the right to hire a defense lawyer, that's how it's understood in the 18th and 19th centuries."
Social Studies,"The prosecutors and defense lawyers develop rules of evidence and they develop procedures and jury instructions and they argue motions. They get more active and the judge gets more passive or reactive. The judge isn't pushing the case along as much and the prosecutor and defense lawyer are slowing it down. That seems like it makes it fairer, but once it gets to a certain point of being slow the prosecutors wanna get rid of the cases, they have too many of them."
Social Studies,"The judges, they have a bunch of civil cases they need to get rid of and so the prosecutors and the judges and the defense lawyers all get together and find ways to bargain the case away rather than spending, now it's days on each case for trial. From their point of view it makes sense."
Social Studies,"They have a faster system and everyone goes home happy and the prosecutor can pursue more cases and the defendant gets a lighter deal but the prosecution makes sure there's some conviction and sentence, but from the point of view of the public, the public doesn't see justice done and the public doesn't trust these plea bargains. At the end of the day, what the defense lawyer's mostly doing is not making sure there's a speedy and public trial but bargaining 95% of cases away before there's a trial."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] What happens if the defendant can't afford a legal counsel? - [Jeffrey] The history of the right to counsel is actually one of the more interesting components of the Sixth Amendment because many of the components have deep roots in the history of England and so were rights that Englishmen enjoyed for many, many years before they were brought over to the colonies and became part of our Constitution of the United States. The right to counsel is a little bit different in that respect."
Social Studies,"Criminal defendants in England and other countries around the time of our founding often did not have a right to counsel of any kind whether they could pay for it or not. This was a bit of an innovation on the part of the Framers, recognizing that all of the other rights they were identifying to defend yourself in court might not amount to much if you didn't have expert assistance or at least the right to obtain expert assistance."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] You've described a lot of changes to how our legal system works over the years. What do you think would have surprised the Framers most about how our legal system works today? - [Stephanos] I think they would have been shocked that a system that was meant to slow down and check governmental power and protect overreaching and protect the people's role, has been so subverted that the people are involved in a few percent of cases."
Social Studies,They designed a system that's slower and less efficient by design than the criminal justice system of continental Europe because they were worried about the king and the Crown pushing around citizens and abusing their power. They wanted grand juries to authorize every criminal charge. We've largely gotten around that in most cases. They wanted petty juries to ensure that every prosecutor's charge was justified and that the legislature's criminal laws weren't being applied too broadly.
Social Studies,"Again, prosecutors now have so many threats and tools and sentences that they can make almost everybody give up their jury trial rights, but the Framers also weren't dealing with the volume of cases we're talking about, and they weren't focused primarily on the violent crimes."
Social Studies,"The federal crimes they were dealing with were seditious libel, criticizing the government, violations of the revenue laws, so it's also fair to point out that they did not expect that these rights were mainly gonna be limitations that benefited people in rape and murder cases. A lot of these protections are mainly designed to make sure that the innocent people get vindicated against unjust charges."
Social Studies,"They might be a little bit surprised that almost all the litigation is by people who may be factually guilty. - [Jeffrey] The next thing that would have surprised the Framers a great deal, I think, is the role of the jury today. The jury trial right mentioned in the Sixth Amendment is actually one of the only things mentioned twice in the Constitution. The right to a jury trial is actually mentioned in the body of the Constitution itself in Article Four, then it's mentioned again in the Sixth Amendment."
Social Studies,"The reason why is because the jury were truly the people's check on the court system and in particular on the prosecutorial power. Serving on a jury, to the Framers, was an honor. It was an act of deep political participation and meaning. In a way that we joke about jury service today as being something of a nuisance, they viewed it as almost as important as voting for the president on Election Day."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] By guaranteeing speedy public trials by jury and due process by law, the Sixth Amendment ensures that citizens, not the government, control criminal justice, but today as Professor Fisher and Judge Bibas note, the Framers might be surprised to learn that due to the rise of plea bargaining, only a small percentage of cases go to trial by jury, circumventing this process."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Sixth Amendment, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to juries in civil cases, when the value in controversy is greater than $20. To learn more about the Seventh Amendment, I talked with two experts. Renee Lerner is the Donald Philip Rothschild Research Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School. She specializes in U.S. and English legal history, and she's written extensively about the history of American juries."
Social Studies,"Suja Thomas is the Peer and Sarah Pederson Professor of Law at the Illinois College of Law. Her research interests include jury provisions in The Bill of Rights, civil procedure, and employment law."
Social Studies,"Professor Thomas, can you tell us a little bit about why the Framers were so interested in protecting this right in particular? - [Professor Thomas] Historically there were juries in England, and a lot of our Constitution is based on what occurred in England, because of course that was our historical origin, and so colonists were really familiar with juries. They knew that the jury restrained government and preserved liberty, and they also knew what could happen without juries."
Social Studies,"Because of this history, juries were really important to Americans and they put it in the Declaration of Independence. - [Professor Lerner] And the Framers in general were very enthusiastic about juries. One of the reasons was that juries had been important in helping to nullify British laws that the American colonists didn't like. An example of these laws is the customs taxes. These were taxes on shipping and were very unpopular, especially in New England."
Social Studies,"What would happen is merchants, the Boston merchants, were supposed to pay a customs tax on merchandise that they imported into Boston and also, in certain cases, exported. What would happen is these Boston merchants would try to import goods and not pay the tax. Sometimes they would get caught by customs inspectors. If a customs inspector caught one of these merchants trying to smuggle in goods, the customs collector would seize the ship and the cargo and hold it essentially for ransom."
Social Studies,"The customs inspector would then bring an action, a lawsuit, against the ship and the cargo in a court called the Court of Admiralty, which was a type of court that sat without a jury. The judge in the Court of Admiralty would ordinarily require the merchant to pay a large fine in order to get back his ship and his cargo. What the Boston merchants started to do, they were deeply unhappy about these fines, they would bring an action in a court that sat with a jury."
Social Studies,"It was an action for trespass against the customs inspector. - [Professor Thomas] They knew that juries could be really useful because, for example, there was concerns about protecting litigants from bad laws, also concerns about actions by the executive, and they were also concerned about corrupt and biased judges, so for all of these reasons there was a real value put on civil juries."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Just for our general information, how exactly is a civil trial different from a criminal trial? - [Professor Thomas] In a civil trial, someone is suing and wants damages for something that went wrong. So if, for example, you're in an employment situation and you allege your employer discriminated against you, you can bring a civil case and you can try to get damages or money for the wrong that was committed against you."
Social Studies,"In that type of case, people who are trying to prove the case have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that this is what happened to you, that discrimination occurred. Then in the criminal context, on the other hand, someone is accused of doing a crime and sometimes there's a grand jury that decides whether that case should proceed against you, and then a criminal jury decides whether or not you committed that crime and they have to decide by beyond a reasonable doubt. So the standard is different."
Social Studies,"For criminal cases it's beyond a reasonable doubt versus in a civil case by a preponderance of the evidence. So it's a higher standard to prove someone is guilty of a crime than in a civil case to actually win. You see this in the O.J. Simpson case, where he's not convicted but they actually sued him in a civil case and they actually won, and there were different standards."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] You kind of see throughout the fourth through eight amendments, which deal with the protection of the accused, quite an emphasis on juries. Why were the Framers so keen on juries? - [Professor Lerner] In the Revolutionary Era in particular, when tensions between the American colonies and Britain were very high, juries were one way that Americans could get popular representation in government. They were not allowed to elect members of the British Parliament."
Social Studies,"They did elect members of the colonial legislatures, but increasingly the British government was taking power from the colonial legislatures. So, this was a way that without an elected legislature the colonists could get representation. John Adams wrote a very interesting passage in his diary in 1771. He wrote that juries were like popularly elected legislatures. That they served that function in the American colonies."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Thomas] There were some concerns about protection for debtors, that was a big issue at the time, and there were arguments that juries could really protect litigants from bad laws that the legislature passed, from actions by the executive, and from potentially corrupt and biased judges. It wasn't the case that the Framers believed that the jury was actually perfect, but they thought that the jury was the best decision maker."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] It seems that the Seventh Amendment has a very specific origin in the history of the Revolutionary War and in some things that were very dear to the founders. What are some of the ways that it has grown and changed in the years since then? - [Professor Lerner] There is, as you see in the amendment, a $20 amount and controversy requirement is what we call it, and that remains in force today even though there has been considerable inflation, but still we've stuck with the $20 limit."
Social Studies,"The difficulty is today that very, very few cases go to juries, and that is true of the federal courts and also the state courts. - [Professor Thomas] Yeah, that's one of the astounding things that many people don't know about. That less than 1% of civil cases, and we have the federal courts as well as the state courts, but in both of those venues, federal courts and state courts, less than 1% of civil cases are tried by juries."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Wow, so what happened there? How did we get from a point where the majority of the cases went before a jury to less than 1%? - [Professor Lerner] One thing that's affected how many cases go to a jury is that judges now have more power to resolve disputes at an early stage. Parties can file a motion to dismiss the case, if they argue that the other side did not have a claim that would hold up under law. Judges can dismiss a case if they find that that's correct."
Social Studies,"- [Professor Thomas] Around the 1930 period of time, you actually see a number of decisions against jury authority where the Supreme Court actually had ruled in favor of jury authority on the exact same issue. So, something's going on in this time frame, around the 1930 period of time."
Social Studies,"It's not exactly easy to figure out what that is, but some of the things that I've seen in some of the public documents that are out there, you actually see comments including by a former Supreme Court Justice saying that judges are actually better than juries."
Social Studies,"A New York State judge stated around this time, ""Yes, a judge should be preferred to a jury."" That's certainly part of what's going on in the story, and then part of what was going on in the story may be to do with the juries getting more diverse around this period of time, and maybe there's an effort by other certain parts of society to not want diverse juries to decide their cases. These are just a couple of different ideas that I think are contributors to why juries decide few cases today."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Interesting, and so by this diversity do you mean like diversity of people from different classes or different genders or different races? What kind of diversity is entering in that time period? - [Professor Thomas] Particularly we're talking about ... We'd be talking about sex and race, yeah, yeah, but I think class is definitely part of that today as well. Then another example that is something that I've spent a good amount of time in my career talking about is something called summary judgment."
Social Studies,"Summary judgment is a procedure where a judge can decide what a reasonable jury could find, and if the judge decides a reasonable jury could not find for the person who brought the case, the judge can dismiss the case."
Social Studies,"If someone brings a case for employment discrimination and there's discovery and that is documents being exchanged between the parties and depositions or questions being asked between different witnesses, and so then an employer can say, ""Okay, you accused us ""of employment discrimination, ""but we think you don't have enough evidence, ""and Judge, we think that no reasonable jury ""could find for this employee."
Social Studies,"""You should order summary judgment for us ""and throw this case out of court."" What has actually happened is in over 70% of the cases where a employer makes a motion for summary judgment in an employment discrimination case, that case will be dismissed in whole or in part. - [Professor Lerner] So, judges can in certain cases end the case before it gets to a jury, but by far the most common way that a dispute ends is by settlement between the parties."
Social Studies,"What has encouraged settlement is that it's much more expensive to bring a case and go to jury verdict today than it was back at the time of the founding. One of the reasons it's so much more expensive is that we now have a system of what we call discovery. That is the parties can ask for information from each other before the trial. They can formally question witnesses, they can ask for documents, they can require questions to be answered."
Social Studies,"All of that goes on before the trial, and that's expensive to do and they want to save money. They want to save money that's involved in this pretrial discovery, and they want to save money at the trial, and so they go ahead and they settle. The reason it's so important for the parties to save money is that in our system each side in a dispute, in a case, has to pay its own legal fees, even if they win, and so the parties have an incentive to settle the case."
Social Studies,"That way they save expenses and also they get a predictable result. Many parties are afraid of going before a jury because they don't know what the result will be. For all these reasons, settlement has become very important. Much more so than it was at the time of the founding."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, we've learned that the Seventh Amendment's protections for jury trials in civil cases derives from the context of the Revolutionary War, when colonists felt that juries were perhaps the only way they could have a voice in the law. Despite this protection, fewer than 1% of civil cases go to trial today, since trials have become prohibitively expensive and their outcomes are unpredictable."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Seventh Amendment, visit the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"John Stinneford is the assistant director of the Criminal Justice Center at the University of Florida Law School. John Bessler is an associate professor of law at the University of Baltimore Law School. So, Professor Bessler, why were the framers so keen to include the 8th Amendment? Why did they wanna protect these rights in particular? - [John B.] Well, these rights were actually enshrined in the English Bill of Rights of 1689."
Social Studies,"And so, when the Americans got into the dispute with Great Britain, they decided they wanted to have the same rights that Englishman had. And so, it was not too surprising that when George Mason actually wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776, that he looked to English law to see what rights the English had because he wanted exactly the same rights."
Social Studies,"And so, this 16 words in the 8th Amendment have been subject to a lot of controversy over the years, but, I think, one of the reasons that the founders wanted this was that, like the English would have problems with the monarch imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, inflicting cruel and unusual punishments, the founders also knew that was a risk that there was abuse from the government in the United States. And so, they also wanted those rights."
Social Studies,"Because, originally, in the Constitution, these rights were not protected against, and the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 which ensured that there would be protections against these cruel and unusual punishments, and excessive bail and excessive fines. - [John S.] If you look at the 8th Amendment, there's three clauses, right? The excessive bail clause, the excessive fines clause, and the cruel and unusual punishments clause."
Social Studies,"And these all have one thing in common, which is that these are all penalties, essentially, that the government inflicts on people usually as the result of either being accused of crime or of being convicted of crime. So if you've been arrested, you're waiting for trial, very often your only way to get out of jail before trial is to make bail. And, of course, after you've been convicted, the court might impose a fine on you, or some other kind of punishment."
Social Studies,"And so, the 8th Amendment is designed to prevent the government from doing things that are excessive. When the government punishes a person, that's the most coercive thing the government does short of war, right? Other than shooting you in battle, picking you up and throwing you in a jail cell is about as bad as it gets. And so, the framers wanted to make sure that we had a constitutional protection when it comes to criminal punishment."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, in a lot of cases in the Bill of Rights you see the framers reacting to some historical evil that they hope to prevent. For example, the 3rd Amendment says you can't quarter soldiers in private citizens' homes because that had been such a important tipping point in the American Revolution."
Social Studies,"Was there something that the framers had in mind as a particular historical evil that they wanted to prevent? - [John B.] Well, there was some historical evils, and the English Bill of Rights went into place in 1689, and when that went into place there was actually a controversy in England around a person by the name of Titus Oates. Titus Oates was somebody who had false accusation, what was had committed perjury resulted, actually, that allegation in the execution of 15 Catholics."
Social Studies,"And the plot that he'd alleged was one to assassinate the king of England. - [John S.] The question is what to do with Oates, right? Because as a sort of a moral matter, he's about as bad as it gets. In fact, in 2005, English historians voted him the worst Briton of the 17th century (Kim laughs) and the third worst Briton of the last 1,000 years, or something like that. So a very bad guy, you could think of him as a sort of a serial killer."
Social Studies,"But the problem is that the actual crime he committed was the crime of perjury. And even though his perjury resulted in the deaths of many innocent people, nonetheless he could only be convicted of perjury, which at the time was a misdemeanor. Which meant that he could not be executed for his crime."
Social Studies,"So when it came time for his sentencing, the judge, Chief Justice Jeffreys, who is a famous hanging judge from English history, says to Oates, ""Well, Oates, we can't take your life, ""we can't take your limb, ""but we have something special prepared for you."" And it turns out that what they had prepared for him was, number one, a huge fine, they fined him like 2,000 marks."
Social Studies,"They sentenced that he'd be dragged across the city of London while being flogged, he was dragged from Aldgate to Newgate while being flogged, and then two days later, just as the scabs were starting to form on his wounds, he's dragged back across the city of London from Newgate to Tyburn, again while being flogged. Many people think the hope was that he would die from the flogging, but, like a cockroach in a nuclear war, he survived."
Social Studies,"- [John B.] This punishment was actually a very severe punishment, and after the English Bill of Rights, it was promulgated. The Titus Oates' punishment was challenged and some of the members of the House of Lords actually called the punishment barbarous, inhumane, and unchristian, and contrary to the English Bill of Rights. And so, there was no precedence to warrant the punishments of whipping and committing to prison for life for the crime of perjury."
Social Studies,"This punishment was eventually remitted, in the sense that Oates was later released. - [John S.] Although, the House of Lords refused to vote to suspend the judgment against Oates 'cause they hated him so much they said, ""So ill a man shouldn't get the benefit of any relief."" But they all agreed that the punishment was cruel and unusual, and what's interesting is in the debate they say things like, ""This punishment is contrary to law and ancient practice."
Social Studies,"""It is without precedent, ""and it'll be a bad precedent for the future."" So, in other words, it's cruel and the way we know it's cruel is because it's so much harsher than has previously been inflicted for the crime of perjury, right? So the Oates case shows us that when the words cruel and unusual were first used, they were used to describe punishments that are harsher than the Common law would permit, or harsher than long-standing prior practice would permit."
Social Studies,"And this means that, among other things, the cruel and unusual punishments clause is not limited to gruesome punishments like torture and the rack and all that kind of thing. Because, in fact, the punishments inflicted on Oates, although they were very harsh for the crime of perjury, were not as harsh as some other punishments that the Common law permitted for other crimes like treason. - [Kim] Wow! So that tells us a lot about the English context of cruel and unusual punishment."
Social Studies,"Do we know what cruel and unusual meant to the framers of the U.S. Bill of Rights? - [John S.] So, punishments were cruel and unusual, again if they're too harsh in light of long-standing prior practice for the crime for which they're inflicted. There's another problem with statutory law, or with decisions of a judge or a king or a president for that matter, that's also really relevant when we think about the 8th Amendment. And that is, sometimes the government gets really mad at someone."
Social Studies,"They either think of a person as an enemy of the state and they wanna inflict the worst punishment they can on that person, or perhaps there's a panic about a certain group in society. So, for example, in American society recently, there have been panics about drug crime, or panics about sex offenses, and every time that happens, the government tries to respond with new forms of punishment that are much, much harsher than what came before."
Social Studies,"And so, the insight behind the 8th Amendment is that when the government wants to inflict a new punishment, you have to compare it against long-standing prior practice, that is you have to compare it against the Common law, right? So the Common law was called the law of custom and long usage, right? So, if something comported with the Common law, it was usual. If it was contrary to the Common law, it was unusual, and that's where we get the phrase cruel and unusual punishments."
Social Studies,"It's basically punishments that are cruel in light of or in comparison to long-standing prior practice. So the basic point of the 8th Amendment from a historical point of view is to prohibit the government from innovating in a cruel manner, making up new cruel punishments in response to some actual or perceived provocation by a criminal. - [John B.] When the U.S. Bill of Rights was adopted, many years later, many decades later, they had their own issues that they were struggling with."
Social Studies,"And so, the history shows that the American founders probably meant something different than the English meant because it was done over 100 years later, but no one knows exactly what was meant when they adopted that wording. To give you an example, when the bill was debated in Congress, a delegate from South Carolina, a representative from South Carolina said that he objected to the words nor cruel and unusual punishments because he said the import of them was too indefinite."
Social Studies,"And there was another legislator, Mr. Livermore from New Hampshire, who said that, ""The clause seems to express a great deal of humanity ""in which account I have no objection to it, ""but as it seems to have no meaning in it, ""I do not think it necessary. What is meant by the terms excessive bail?"", he asked. ""Who are to be the judges?"", he also asked."
Social Studies,"""What is understood by excessive fines? It lies with the Court to determine."" And so, that's really where we are today in a lot of ways, the Court is still deciding, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court, is still deciding what the 8th Amendment line what it actually means today. - [John S.] The modern case law, especially starting in the 1970s, revolved a lot around the death penalty."
Social Studies,"And so, the question was, is it still okay to execute people for various crimes short of murder? Since the 70s, the Court has continued to do that in a number of areas so it's said you can't execute the mentally disabled anymore, you can't execute minors, you can't execute anyone for a non-homicide offense."
Social Studies,"Although it's limited the death penalty in the name of current standards of decency, it's really not clear how the Court has set about to determine whether a punishment meets current standards of decency. When the Court is kind of on its own saying that a punishment violates current standards of decency, despite the fact that most democratically elected legislators actually approved the practice that it looks like the Court's acting as sort of a political body."
Social Studies,"It sort of led the Court to ignore what I think is the real danger of cruelty, which is that when there's a public panic and the legislature responds by ratcheting a punishment to new and unprecedented levels of punishment. And that's actually happened quite a lot in the last 40 years. And every time there's a panic, you'll predicatively see the legislators coming up with new punishments that are much, much harsher than what came before."
Social Studies,"And so, for example, with registered sex offenders, there are now a bunch of states that actually impose chemical castration as a form of punishment for sex offenders. Now, castration as a form of punishment fell out of usage in the 13th century. We're literally getting medieval on sex offenders, but the Court can't do anything really to stop it or at least hasn't because these are very popular forms of punishment, everyone hates sex offenders."
Social Studies,"- [John B.] The UN has actually decided that anything more than 15 days use of solitary confinement should not be permitted. Justice Anthony Kennedy actually raised the issue of solitary confinement in recent opinion. He authored for the Supreme Court, he actually raised the issue on his own, had a whole argument at one point talking about how long people actually spent in solitary confinement in American prisons, including on death row."
Social Studies,"And you have cases actually where people are spending not just years, but sometimes decades on death row in these kinds of conditions. Justice Breyer just wrote a dissent in a case where the person had been on death row for more than 40 years, so literally four decades in these kinds of very harsh conditions of confinement."
Social Studies,"Other countries have decided that is not something that they want to permit and they've actually set out a rule that anybody that's on death row for a certain number of years, for example, would have their sentence commuted to a life sentence because of the psychological aspect of sorta waiting for one's own death. - [Kim] In the Bill of Rights, this is the last of four amendments actually, that are concerned with protections for the accused."
Social Studies,"So, why do you think there's so much in the Bill of Rights about the justice system? Were the framers particularly interested in making sure that the accused had rights? - [John S.] Yeah, they were."
Social Studies,"And, in particular, Americans were very devoted to the idea of the Common law as a source of rights, right? In fact, that's why we had the American Revolution in the first place, was that England was denying to Americans Common law rights, like the right not to be taxed without representation in parliament, but also more specifically to the criminal law, they were denying them the right to a jury trial in criminal cases. And so, Americans wanted to make sure that when the U.S."
Social Studies,"Constitution was adopted, that those Common law rights that had built up over time in England would be preserved in the new American constitutional order. And many of those rights had to do with criminal law, both criminal procedures and, to some degree, subset of criminal law and, of course, criminal punishments. And again, the reason gets back to sort of what I said at the beginning, which is that when the government punishes someone, that's about the worst thing it can do."
Social Studies,"And because the early Americans who framed the Constitution were very powerfully concerned with liberty, they wanted to make sure the government would preserve their liberty, protect their liberty, and not become tyrannical, right? And so, one of the main ways that they wanted to make sure this happened was by limiting the power of the government to punish whoever it wanted to for any reason that it wanted to."
Social Studies,"And so, we have a, really the majority of the protections in the Bill of Rights have to do with the protections for criminal defendants. - [Kim] What about excessive bail and excessive fines? How can we define what kind of, financial penalty, is proportionate to a crime? - [John B.] The courts have said, essentially, they've looked at dictionary definitions that excessive means more than is necessary. One of the core principles actually go back to look at Beccaria's work in the 1760s."
Social Studies,"He talked about this idea of a scale of crimes and a scale of punishments, and he said that there should be proportionality between the two. And so, that proportionality principle is one that we're really still wrestling with today."
Social Studies,"- [John S.] Now, the point of bail is not to punish someone, but rather just to make sure that they will appear at trial, right? And so, the amount of money you have to impose for bail doesn't depend so much on what crime you committed, but what your financial resources are, right? It depends partially on the crime too, but largely on your financial resources."
Social Studies,"So the amount of money necessary to make sure that a poor man appears at trial is probably gonna be much lower than the amount of money necessary to make sure that a rich man appears at trial. And so, it's a standard that depends partly on the nature of the crime, but also partially on the nature of the offender. - [Kim] I imagine that what seems like cruel and unusual punishment in the 18th century might not be what we consider cruel and unusual today."
Social Studies,"For example, we don't do whipping as a punishment anymore. How has what counts as cruel and unusual punishment changed over time? - [John B.] The law really changes gradually over time, as you know. And so, when you look back at history they actually had a large collection of pretty gruesome punishments back in the 18th century."
Social Studies,"And we had non-lethal corporal punishments, they used things like branding people, they, of course, were whipping slaves back then, slavery was still around, this was well before the Civil War ended, the institution of slavery. And we also had things like ear cropping, people would get their ears cut off."
Social Studies,"In the Crimes Act of 1790, which was passed just the year before the ratification of the 8th Amendment, the Congress actually authorized public whipping, lashing of people, and also authorized the pillory, the same punishment that had been used against Titus Oates. So, there was these non-lethal corporal punishments, and really the death penalty is sort of the last vestige of bodily punishment that the 8th Amendment, the Supreme Court has read the 8th Amendment to allow the use of capital punishment."
Social Studies,"That issue is still a very live one before the Supreme Court. We're now seeing challenges about lethal injection, protocols. We saw a challenge to a protocol in Kentucky in 2008. We saw one to a protocol in Oklahoma in 2015. These, of course, are things that the founding fathers would never have envisioned . - [John S.] Lethal injection typically involves a three-drug cocktail. So there's a barbiturate, which is supposed to put you to sleep."
Social Studies,"There's a paralyzing agent, which paralyzes your body and also stops your lungs from moving. And there's a heart-stopping agent. Give the offender all three and they're supposed to die quickly and painlessly. But the problem is if the sedative doesn't put you completely, deeply unconscious, then the other two drugs are likely to make you suffer quite a bit before you die."
Social Studies,"And so, the question is this cruel and unusual, or is it not cruel and unusual? And to date, the Supreme Court has twice held that lethal injection is not cruel and unusual, and their main reason has been that the state's not trying to torture you to death. And so, if maybe, or sometimes accidentally, tortured to death, well, that's just too bad, but it's not a cruel and unusual punishment. - [John B.] So, the Supreme Court has approved various methods of execution."
Social Studies,"At the same time, however, the 8th Amendment has been read to protect prisoners. So, in general, the 8th Amendment is sort of a protective shield that prohibits prison guards from gratuitously beating up inmates. It requires prisons to provide some level of healthcare to prisoners because they cannot get it themselves, they're sort of wards of the state once they're put in prison. It requires inmates be fed and sheltered."
Social Studies,"So, in a lot of ways, the 8th Amendment is a protective shield protecting inmates, but then in the use of the capital punishment it becomes what I like to call kind of a, it's kind of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde kind of jurisprudence that the 8th Amendment has right now. - [Kim] So we've learned that the 8th Amendment seeks to limit the power of the government in meting out punishment to people who have been accused or convicted of a crime."
Social Studies,"Although it's hard to tell exactly what constitutes excessive fines or bail, in general, it's accepted that those punishments should be proportional to the crimes in question. Today, one of the biggest debates concerns whether, or how, the 8th Amendment may limit the death penalty. To learn more about the 8th Amendment, visit the National Constituiton Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Ninth Amendment, I talked with two experts. Kurt Lash is the E. Claiborne Robins Distinguished Chair in Law at the University of Richmond School of Law. Jeffrey Rosen is the president and CEO of the National Constitution Center. He has written extensively on the history of the Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"Professor Lash, can you tell us a little bit more about this amendment? Why did the Framers include this amendment in the first place? - [Kurt] The Ninth Amendment, like rest of the Bill of Rights, was added at the insistence of the states. Although the advocates of the proposed Constitution had claimed that the national government would have only limited enumerated power, the state ratifying conventions wanted that promise put in writing."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] Originally, the Constitution didn't contain a bill of rights 'cause James Madison said a bill of rights would be unnecessary or dangerous, unnecessary 'cause the Constitution itself was a bill of rights."
Social Studies,"It only granted Congress limited powers, and therefore, Congress had no power to infringe free speech, for example, or religious liberty, and therefore, wouldn't be able to do so, and dangerous, Madison said, because if you had a bill of rights, people might wrongly assume that if a right wasn't written down, it wasn't protected, but in response to objections by anti-federalists, that is those opposed to the ratification of the Constitution, led by George Mason of Virginia, as well as Edmund Randolph of Virginia and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, so those three guys said, ""Hey, ""unless we include a bill of rights ""for greater security and safety, ""then we don't think the Constitution should be ratified."" In response to their objections and those in ratifying conventions, many of which demanded a bill of rights, Madison changed his mind, and he included a bill of rights, which he cut-and-pasted from revolutionary-era state constitutions, and viewers and listeners can check those out at the Interactive Constitution."
Social Studies,"Then that raised an interpretive problem. Madison and others were worried, if you just had a limited list of rights, 10 amendments in particular, protecting particular rights, people might assume that if a right wasn't written down, then it wasn't protected, and the Framers didn't want you to reach that conclusion because they believed that our rights come from God or nature and not from government."
Social Studies,"Thomas Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence, said we're all endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. - [Kurt] When you look at these amendments, our first 10 amendments, you'll notice that some address specific issues, like speech and the right to bear arms. The last two amendments on that list, however, address broader issues of Constitutional interpretation. These are rules of construction."
Social Studies,The Tenth Amendment declares that all powers not delegated away remain under the control of the people in the states. The Ninth Amendment addresses the problem potentially raised by adding this list in a bill of rights.
Social Studies,"The Ninth Amendment tells us that just because the Constitution lists certain important limitations on federal power, this doesn't mean that the federal government has otherwise unlimited power, or, as the Ninth Amendment puts it, ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, ""shall not be construed to deny or disparage ""others retained by the people."" In this way, those two last rules of construction ensure that every subject not placed under the control of the national government would remain under the control of the people in the states and remain there as a matter of right."
Social Studies,These amendments protect the people's retained right to local self government.
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] I talked a bit about natural rights because that same notion of the idea that you retain natural rights when you move from the state of nature to the civil society is picked up in the language of the Ninth Amendment, which says that the enumeration ""of certain rights ""shall not be construed to deny or disparage others ""retained by the people,"" so one big theory of the Ninth Amendment is that it refers to these natural rights that come from God or nature and that you retain during the transition from the state of nature to civil society."
Social Studies,- [Kim] Can you give us a few examples of what those unenumerated rights that people have debated have been? - [Jeffrey] The paradigmatic source for identifying what unenumerated rights are protected is a case called Corfield v. Coryell.
Social Studies,"It was decided in the early 19th Century, and it was cited repeatedly by the people who wrote the Privileges or Immunities Clause to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and basically, the Privileges or Immunities Clause says that no state shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, and the question is what are those privileges or immunities? In trying to define them, John Bingham, who wrote the Fourteenth Amendment, and a lot of other people said, ""Well, some of the privileges or immunities ""include the rights written down in the Bill of Rights, ""but others are not written down in the Bill of Rights, ""and you can find them in the Corfield and Coryell case."
Social Studies,"They're rights that are fundamental. They're uniform from state to state, and they've been considered basic rights of Americans from the beginning. Some of these rights include the right to make and enforce contracts, to sue and be sued, to have basic economic rights, and also to have the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus, which is in the original Constitution, and that's the right to challenge the constitutionality of your conviction. It's in the original Constitution, but not in the Bill of Rights."
Social Studies,"Those are just some examples of the unenumerated economic rights that the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment considered to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and by implication, by the Ninth Amendment too, 'cause they are natural rights, as we heard Roger Sherman say, the basic rights of acquiring and possessing property and obtaining happiness and safety, those are some of those rights."
Social Studies,"- [Kurt] The Ninth Amendment raises the difficult issue of how exactly you determine what the rights are that are actually retained by the people. The text of the Ninth Amendment itself tells us very little about the specific content of our retained rights, but in fact, these retained rights are as numerous as the stars in the sky."
Social Studies,"They include everything from wearing a hat to walking on the sidewalk, to purchasing life insurance, or determining where you can park your car, or what classes should be offered in the local high school, basically everything that was never meant to be handed to the control of the national government, all of these are rights retained to the control of the people in the several states, and all of these rights will be protected if you limit the scope of federal power."
Social Studies,"A limited interpretation of the Commerce Clause, for example, preserves the people's retained right to establish local educational policy and to pass all manner of local civil rights legislation that's not expressly covered by the federal Constitution. The greater the limits on federal power, the greater the freedom of local communities. By making a limited interpretation of federal power a right, this ensure the matter can be litigated in federal court and not just left to political compromise."
Social Studies,"Over time, courts will produce a body of law that invalidates attempts by the federal government to regulate our lives in forbidden ways, such as not having the power under the Commerce Clause to force us to purchase private health insurance or not having the power to commandeer state official and force them to enforce federal immigration policy."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Does this refer back to some extent to kind of the common law of England and the things that were considered the natural rights of Englishmen? - [Jeffrey] Yes, it does, although we should distinguish it if we're gonna be precise, which we should. Not all of the common law rights of Englishmen were natural rights. Common law rights, basically, are rights that were traditionally protected by English law. They're rights that had been recognized by English judges over centuries."
Social Studies,"Natural rights come from God or nature, not from government. There's overlap between those groups, but there might've been some common law rights of English people that were recognized by tradition, like the right to jury trial, for example. That's not a natural right 'cause there are no juries in the state of nature. There are just people who are (laughs) imagining forming governments."
Social Studies,"It makes it a little tricky, but it's actually not that analytically tricky, and it's so interesting that over and over again, the Framers said, ""You know, this is just, everyone knows what these ""natural rights are."" They're the ones that are recognized in Corfield and Coryell, and then other enumerated rights might include the common law rights of Englishmen, but it was a pretty short list, and the best way to just figure out which rights were natural, go to the Interactive Constitution, click down, and look at the Virginia Declaration of Rights."
Social Studies,"Look at the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, the New Hampshire Constitution. It has this beautiful preamble about what a natural right is, and you'll just see that all of these state constitutions are recognizing the same natural rights over and over again. - [Kim] Has the Supreme Court ever decided a case based on the Ninth Amendment? - [Kurt] The first judicial opinion was actually written by Justice Joseph Story, one of the most famous justices in American history."
Social Studies,"In his opinion in Houston Against Moore, decided in 1820, Story explained that the spirit and letter of the Ninth Amendment called for the limited interpreting of the scope of federal power in order to avoid interfering with state laws regarding the local militia. In fact, it wasn't until the 20th Century that you find scholars and justices trying to invert the Ninth Amendment in a manner that allowed or even required federal interference with local policies."
Social Studies,"In Griswold against Connecticut, for example, Justice Arthur Goldberg argued that the Ninth Amendment supported the court's invalidation of state contraception laws. - [Jeffrey] Douglas says in this case that the Constitution and the particular rights and the Bill of Rights include certain penumbras formed be emanations, from the particular guarantees that may create broader unenumerated rights, and privacy was one of them."
Social Studies,Douglas says privacy is protected in different ways in different parts of the Bill of Rights. The Fourth Amendment protects our right against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Third Amendment protects the right not to have soldiers quartered in the home.
Social Studies,"The First Amendment protects a right of freedom of association, and from these particular expressions of privacy, Douglas extracted, or inferred, a broader and more sweeping right of privacy, which could be extended to cover a married couple's right to use contraception. - [Kim] When the Bill of Rights was ratified in the late 18th Century, it only applied to the federal government."
Social Studies,"It was not until after the Civil War, in the late 1860s and early 1870s, that the Fourteenth Amendment applied some of the protections of the Bill of Rights to state governments. How does the Fourteenth Amendment impact our understanding of the Ninth Amendment? - [Kurt] Most Constitutional historians believe that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was originally understood as applying the first eight amendments against the states."
Social Studies,"What of the Ninth Amendment? Is it possible that the Privileges or Immunities Clause turns the Ninth Amendment from a provision protecting local government to one that interferes with local government? Many libertarian scholars believe so. A close look at the historical record, however, shows that this is not likely."
Social Studies,"To begin with, John Bingham, the man who framed the Privileges or Immunities Clause, publicly declared at the House of Representatives that the Privileges or Immunities Clause made the first eight amendments enforceable against the states. He said nothing about either the Ninth or Tenth Amendments."
Social Studies,"Meanwhile, in the Senate, the man who introduced the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to his college, Jacob Howard, also said that the Privileges or Immunities Clause would apply the first eight amendments against the states, and he too said nothing about the Ninth or Tenth Amendments. Finally, the public that debated and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment remained broadly committed to the federalist principle of dividing power between the state and local governments."
Social Studies,"It had been the slave-holding rebel sates that had violated this principle by demanding that slavery be enforced throughout the nation, regardless of local freedom laws. If we look at the period in which they adopted the Fourteenth Amendment, it appears that that ammendment did, in fact, apply the textual rights of the first eight amendments against the states, but it left everything else to local control, subject only to the requirements of due process and equal protection."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] The Ninth Amendment, at the very least, is a question of interpretation. It says don't assume that if a right isn't written down it's not protected. When the late Robert Bork, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1987 but didn't get through, said that the Ninth Amendment should be treated as an ink blot because we can't know what rights are actually protected by the Ninth Amendment, it should be ignored, that can't be right. That's the one thing that Madison said don't do."
Social Studies,"Don't assume that if the right isn't written down, it's not protected. Saying that that matter of construction is important and that there are certain rights not enumerated in the Constitution that are protected doesn't tell us which rights are protected, and that's where all of the action and all of the drama and all of the excitement and Constitutional interpretation in the 20th and 21st Century has come from."
Social Studies,"How do we identify the rights that are not written down, are not enumerated, but are protected? There's a whole lot to say about that. In fact, that's why we teach Constitutional law, is to study the methodologies of interpretation that lead people to different conclusions about which unenumerated rights are protected. - [Kim] We've learned that the Ninth Amendment served as an assurance that the Bill of Rights was not an exhaustive list of the rights retained by the people or the states."
Social Studies,"How can you protect unenumerated rights, which, by their very definition, aren't named in the Constitution? Kurt Lash sees the original meaning of the Ninth Amendment as a restriction on federal power. Jeff Rosen reminds us that although it's difficult to tell which rights the Framers intended to protect with the Ninth Amendment, it's likely that those rights included the same natural, unalienable rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence."
Social Studies,"To learn more about the Ninth Amendment, visit the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution in Khan Academy resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"It reads, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. So what does this actually mean? To learn more, I sought out the help of some experts. Randy Barnett is the Carmack Waterhouse professor of legal theory at the Georgetown University Law Center and director of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution."
Social Studies,"Robert Schapiro is the Asa Griggs Candler professor of law and dean of Emory Law School. So, Professor Barnett, can you tell us a little bit just about what that means? It's a little dense. - [Prof. Barnett] During the ratification debates there was lots of opposition to the Constitution. In fact, the Constitution only was ratified after the proponents of the Constitution, who called themselves Federalists, promised that amendments would be made to the Constitution."
Social Studies,"Because it was the lack of a Bill of Rights and other changes that caused people to oppose it. And so they said they would put a bill of rights on afterwards and at that point in these ratification conventions, conventions started proposing amendments to Congress that accompanied their ratification. So they ratified it and they said, but here are some changes we want to see made. And one of the changes that several states asked for was wording that was very much like what became the 10th amendment."
Social Studies,"A reaffirmation of the fact that the federal government was going to be one of limited and enumerated powers. - [Prof. Schapiro] And the 10th amendment is an expression of the idea that while there are more powers given to the central government of the United States it's still the case that the only power that the central government, the national government, can exercise are powers specifically given to it by the Constitution."
Social Studies,"So the 10th amendment is an embodiment of the structural principle that the only powers that the national government has are those that are delegated to it in the Constitution. As opposed to the states who have general powers within their boundaries. - [Kim] One of the things that I think we see in the Bill of Rights is many examples of the framers responding to particular historical evils that they had witnessed in England or in Europe, more generally."
Social Studies,"So was there something in particular they had in mind they were trying to prevent with the 10th amendment? - [Prof. Schapiro] I think the particular evil they were concerned with was the concern of a distant, powerful, centralized government. That had been the government of King George. They wanted to make sure that wasn't the government of President George Washington and the 10th amendment states that the national government is not an all powerful body with general authority to do whatever it wants."
Social Studies,"It's in line with the structure of the Constitution which says there are certain powers given to the national government, there certainly are definite powers given to them but only some powers. And that idea of being concerned of a distant, strong government far away from the people is really what underlies the principle of the Constitution. And that's what we see in the 10th amendment, specifying that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are reserved to the states."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So what would you say is important about the 10th amendment? - [Prof. Barnett] It reaffirms that the basic structure of the Constitution is one of limited and enumerated powers. How limited, of course, is a matter of debate. But the fact that they are limited and that all other powers are reserved to the states respectively or to the people is now a matter of Constitutional law, it's a matter of the text."
Social Studies,"The other thing that's interesting about the 10th amendment is that in Congress they added the phrase, or to the people at the end. The states did not propose that language. The states proposed the wording of the 10th amendment and it just would have stopped where it said are reserved to the states. And so that made the ninth amendment less a states' rights provision than the states had wanted and less a states' rights provision than people read it today. So the people have rights."
Social Studies,"In fact, nowhere in the Constitution does it say anyone except individuals or persons have rights. It doesn't say states have rights. The 10th amendment is about reserved powers and those are the powers that the people have to govern themselves as well as other powers and what this shows is that the people not only have rights they also have powers. Perhaps the most important thing, however, is to note that these two are separate provisions."
Social Studies,"That the Supreme Court has sometimes read the 10th amendment, or the ninth amendment, as meaning basically the 10th amendment that the people have reserved powers. But we know they're different because they are put in there separately and in fact Madison placed a much higher premium on the importance of the ninth amendment as opposed to the 10th. - [Prof."
Social Studies,"Schapiro] The 10th amendment and the ninth amendment really speak to the structure of the Constitutional system, what it means to have a Constitution setting up a national government, The 10th amendment is really a statement of the overall structure of what we call Federalism. Certain powers given to the national government and then powers reserved to the states. The ninth amendment speaks more to the rights side of things, that is, we have certain rights which are set forth in the Bill of Rights."
Social Studies,"The first amendment about freedom of speech and religion, the fourth amendment about protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and there was some concern expressed in the late 1700s that if you specified those rights, did that somehow mean that the national government could do whatever else it wanted? And so the ninth amendment says, the enumeration of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
Social Studies,So it's in line with the idea that national government has certain powers but they are limited because other powers are reserved to the states. And the power of the national government may also be limited because there are rights that are reserved to the people. - [Kim] How do you think the 10th amendment tells us that the framers intended the federal government and the state governments to relate to each other? - [Prof.
Social Studies,"Schapiro] The 10th amendment really is a little more about structure than about specific content. So I think the 10th amendment embodies the idea that we should think carefully about what are the powers given to the national government, understanding that whatever's given to the national government may take powers away from the states. And so the 10th amendment is really a text that embodies the overall principle of Federalism that is implicit throughout the United States Constitution. - [Prof."
Social Studies,"Barnett] In fact, the 10th amendment is in some respects kind of a replay of the first sentence of Article One that says that Congress only has the powers herein granted. States have the powers, by contrast, and the 10th amendment affirms, the states have the powers that are not granted to the federal government but are granted to them under state constitutions."
Social Studies,"So just as the federal government has the powers it has under the US Constitution, state governments have the powers they have under state constitutions and the people reserve all other powers to themselves. - [Kim] So how has the 10th amendment been interpreted by the Supreme Court over time? I imagine there have been some cases about this as the federal government has gotten more powerful. - [Prof."
Social Studies,"Schapiro] Exactly, so the 10th amendment, which really is just about the structure of government, saying some power is given to the national government and there's a concern about the power reserved to the states, the understanding of that has really evolved with the understanding of the breadth, of the power of the national government. And what we've seen over the course of history in the United States is that there's been a broader understanding of the power of the government of the United States."
Social Studies,"That expansion has really come mainly in two forms. One is with regard to the government's power to regulate interstate commerce and the broad interpretation of the national government's power to regulate commerce. We saw that particularly in the context of the great depression when there was viewed to be tremendous social dislocation, tremendous economic problems in the United States to the point at which some feared that the American democracy might collapse."
Social Studies,"And the national government then was allowed to exercise more authority over the economy. - [Prof. Barnett] The Supreme Court, in the New Deal, declared the 10th amendment as a truism, meaning as long as you find a power then you can't have a 10th amendment objection to that power. That's right, as a logical matter, except that if you continue to expand your interpretation of those powers then you are basically violating the spirit, if not the letter, of the 10th amendment."
Social Studies,"And finally then, during the Rehnquist Court, until today the Supreme Courts started using the 10th amendment to enforce the spirit of the Constitution which preserved the existence of states even when Congress was claiming powers that went far beyond those that were originally mentioned in the Constitution's text. - [Prof."
Social Studies,"Schapiro] So, in some cases in the early 20th century you did see the United States Supreme Court interpreting the 10th amendment to limit, to some extent, what the national government could do if, say, the issue were child labor or minimum wage laws, things like that."
Social Studies,"A question is, is that really something that the national government can do? But in the wake of, we say, the New Deal legislation that was put forward by Congress in the great depression of the 1930s and approved by the Supreme Court, we've seen the Supreme Court take a much narrower understanding of the 10th amendment. Or, again, we can really see the 10th amendment in balance with the power of the national government."
Social Studies,And as we've understood a broader role for the national government the role reserved to the states has shrunk. - [Kim] This is fascinating. So one thing that interests me about this in terms of US history is the way that later on the 14th amendment is interpreted to incorporate the Bill of Rights in to the states. So how does the 14th amendment's protection of equal citizenship rights then intersect with the idea that states have certain individual powers? - [Prof.
Social Studies,"Schapiro] So certainly in the wake of the Civil War we saw the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments."
Social Studies,"The 13th amendment banning slavery, the 14th amendment guaranteeing rights of national citizenship and equal protection and due process and the 15th amendment guaranteeing the right to vote, all of which expanded the power of the national government and particularly the 14th amendment and its guarantee of equal protection of laws and due process of laws were really new national restrictions on state authority, a new empowerment of the national government to protect individuals no matter what state they were."
Social Studies,"So since the structure of the 10th amendment is not about protecting a particular body of power, it would be natural that as the 14th amendment expands the role of the national government that there'd be less for the states to do completely immune from federal intrusion. - [Prof. Barnett] The 14th amendment represents a fundamental change to our system of Federalism."
Social Studies,Precisely because it has a section five in the 14th amendment which empowers Congress to enforce the provisions of the previous four sections including section one which has the citizenship clause and the privileges or immunities clause and the due process clause and the equal protection clause. So Congress is given an enumerated power to protect individuals from their own state governments violating their fundamental rights under those section one provisions.
Social Studies,"That's a change in our Federalism that is consistent with the 10th amendment because it's a power that is delegated to Congress by the Constitution, by section five of the 14th amendment. What happened to that, however, immediately after it was enacted is the Supreme Court decided, and I think quite consciously in their minds decided, that this change in our system of Federalism was objectionable. In fact it was the product of radical republicans in Congress and it really needed to be undone."
Social Studies,"And so in one of the earliest examples of what I would call living Constitutionalism, in a series of cases the Supreme Court cut back on the powers of Congress to protect individuals from the rights of their citizens in cases like the Slaughterhouse cases or United States versus Crookshank, or Plessy versus Ferguson."
Social Studies,"These are cases, the civil rights cases are more in which the Supreme Court actually cut back on the scope in order to restore the Federalism that existed prior to the Civil War that the justices preferred. - [Prof. Schapiro] I think based on its text and its interpretation over time we see the 10th amendment really being a recognition of the Federalist structure of the United States Constitution, meaning there will be a national government and there will be states. And that has not changed over time."
Social Studies,What has changed over time is an understanding about the scope of the role of the national government. How much power the national government needs either to regulate the national economy or to protect individual rights. Certainly the interpretation of the interstate commerce clause and the enactment of the 14th amendment have been key elements in expanding the role of national power. - [Prof.
Social Studies,Barnett] But all of this expansion of national power is completely consistent with the language of the 10th amendment which again does not specify any particular kind of power reserved to the states. It just recognizes that there will be a national government and there will be states. - [Kim] So how have the courts been utilizing the 10th amendment in recent years? - [Prof. Barnett] In recent years the courts have been using the 10th amendment not so much for what it says but for its spirit.
Social Studies,"The idea that it reaffirms the importance of states in our Constitutional structure. What's happened since the New Deal is the powers of Congress under its enumerated powers have been so broadly or expansively interpreted that if they were all to be applied to states they way they are applied to private individuals and private companies essentially Congress could basically run all the states using it's commerce power combined with its necessary and proper clause power, et cetera."
Social Studies,"What the Supreme Court has done in recent years is said this violates the first principles of our Constitutional order which says states are important, the 10th amendment affirms that. And therefore they've created certain carve out or special protections for states from these broadly or expansively read Congressional powers."
Social Studies,"None of this is really stemming from the original meaning of the 10th amendment because what's already happened is the original meaning of the enumerated powers has already been exceeded. But what it's attempting to do is to keep in place the balance between federal and state powers that the 10th amendment represented. But doing so in a way that's basically modern. It's adding the states to a list of protected entities, protected from expansive federal power."
Social Studies,- [Kim] So we've learned that the 10th amendment reaffirms that the federal government of the United States will be a limited government with enumerated powers. But as the scope of the federal government has grown so has debate over the interpretation of the 10th amendment.
Social Studies,Which actions of the states can the federal government regulate and which exceed federal power? To learn more about the 10th amendment visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics..
Social Studies,"So what were those two proposed amendments that weren't ratified along with the other 10? The unadopted amendments. To learn more, I talked to Fergus Bordewich. He's a writer and a historian, and the author of The First Congress: How James Madison, George Washington, and a Group of Extraordinary Men Invented the Government."
Social Studies,"These unadopted amendments which weren't included in the Bill of Rights aren't nearly as well known, so what were they? - [Fergus] Well, to put it in context, there were more than 200 amendments originally proposed during the First Congress. James Madison had the responsibility of winnowing those 200 down to a manageable number. He compressed them finally down to 19, then to 17, and finally, to 12. Twelve were approved by the First Congress."
Social Studies,"Ten of them are the ones that we today call the Bill of Rights, but nobody then referred to them as the Bill of Rights. Madison and other members of the First Congress referred to them as adjustments of the Constitution, alterations of the Constitution, and sometimes as amendments, but the term Bill of Rights only came into use in the 20th century. - [Kim] Really, I had no idea."
Social Studies,"- [Fergus] Members of the First Congress often talked about the lack of a Bill of Rights, and they referred to Bills of Rights that some states had, but the first ten amendments to the Constitution were not treated as a Bill of Rights. In fact, those who most wanted a Bill of Rights said this isn't one. - [Kim] Okay, so we end up with 12 adjustments to the Constitution, but in today's Bill of Rights, there are only 10."
Social Studies,"So what were those other two? - [Fergus] One of them had to do with the apportionment of seats in Congress, how many seats would there be, and how many people would each member of the House of Representatives represent. That was one amendment. The other had to do with the method of providing salaries for members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. - [Kim] All right, so we have the text of these two unadopted amendments here."
Social Studies,"One says, after the first enumeration required by the first article of the Constitution, there shall be one Representative for every 30,000, until the number shall amount to one hundred, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress that there shall not be less than 100 Representatives, nor less than one Representative for every 40,000 persons until the number of Representatives shall amount to 200, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than 200 Representatives, nor more than one Representative for every 50,000 persons."
Social Studies,"Okay, so it seems like the general gist here is setting up a proportional arrangement about the House of Representatives. The other one's a little bit shorter. It says, no law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened. So you can't change how much Senators and Representatives get paid without an election in-between, so they can't raise their own salaries."
Social Studies,"So why did these two amendments end up on the cutting room floor? - [Fergus] Well, bear in mind that both of these were approved by Congress. Then they went out to the states, they had to be ratified by the states. The states ratified the other ten that we're all familiar with. They almost ratified the amendment having to do with the apportionment of seats in Congress. That ratification fell short by one state."
Social Studies,"The other one having to do with the salaries of Congress, although it was very uncontroversial, simply didn't generate enough interest to be ratified. The two amendments which failed to be ratified, were the only two that strictly do not have to do with rights. I don't think that there was a very passionate concern for them among the voting public. Did the Constitution need to be amended in order to establish a process for setting member salaries? Well no, it didn't. We know that it did not."
Social Studies,"Was it necessary to amend the Constitution to set a principle of apportionment? Well, apparently not. I think, by and large, Americans and our Representatives recognize principles that rise to the level of Constitutional amendment. With respect to these two amendments, neither of them really has to do with rights, and that's why we somewhat misunderstand them if we're always referring to a Bill of Rights, because these two are not rights. They're essentially more on the order of Congressional housekeeping."
Social Studies,"There was virtually no debate in Congress at all about the proposed amendment that would enable Congress to provide salaries for members. Everybody thought this is a pretty good idea. In point of fact, as we all know, in the 200 years plus since then, Congressional salaries have been raised by legislation when needed. It turned out that the amendment absolutely wasn't necessary, even though it was finally ratified in 1992."
Social Studies,"Now, there was a great deal of debate, however, over the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives. In the first House of Representatives, there were only 59 members. They represented districts of widely varying size. For example, one representative from Georgia represented 16,000 people. A representative from the Maine district of Massachusetts, Maine was not a separate state then, represented 96,000."
Social Studies,"The sharpest debate was over how many individuals would a given member of the House represent. They had to come up with a number. It wasn't obvious what the number should be. The debate really was over whether each Representative would represent 30,000 or 40,000. This doesn't sound important today, but our country was much smaller, obviously much smaller, and these were fairly big numbers for the time. Those who argued for each Representative representing 30,000, wanted a larger House of Representatives."
Social Studies,"It was a more populist kind of idea. The people who argued most forcefully for it were anti-Federalists, that's to say, those were the people who really didn't like the Constitution at all. They didn't even want it. They wanted what they saw as a more democratic House of Representatives. More conservative members argued for a smaller House of Representatives based on the idea that the larger it would be, the less manageable it would be."
Social Studies,"James Madison himself was very hostile to the idea of a larger House of Representatives, arguing that it would be a step towards tyranny because a body too large would fall victim to demagogues. - [Kim] This is really fascinating, because even if we had gone with 30,000 or 40,000, today the House of Representatives would have more than 10,000 people in it. But today, we only have 435 Representatives in the House."
Social Studies,"How did we get from there to here? - [Fergus] Well, Congress did provide for the incremental increase in the size of congressional districts, knowing that population would increase. Everybody knew it was going to increase. Nobody in 1789 or 1790 could imagine a country of two hundred million people. The outermost number that they contemplated in 1790 was about 200. We now know it's 435. Over time in the 19th century, as we admitted more states, we added more population and more representatives."
Social Studies,"The politics of stopping it at 435 is frankly a little intricate. But at any rate, the number continued to increase through the 19th century into the 20th century. There was no reapportionment after the census of 1920. The Republicans who dominated in Congress at the time worried that reapportioning after 1920 would increase the number of Democrats. It became a partisan issue. There was no reapportionment until later in the 1920s, when it was stopped at 435."
Social Studies,"Since then, there's basically been a consensus that this is a manageable number. - [Kim] One of these amendments actually reappeared and was passed in 1992. Can you tell us a little bit about the story of this lost amendment? - [Fergus] Yeah, it's a cute story."
Social Studies,"A student at the University of Texas in the 1980s was writing a paper for history class and stumbled across this long forgotten amendment, and wrote about it, and was given, I believe, a C grade for it because his professor considered the subject irrelevant and inconsequential. His name was Gregory Watson. He was so, I think, frustrated by the grade but also inspired by the story of this forgotten amendment that he began to wage initially a one-man, a one-student lobbying campaign."
Social Studies,"Astonishingly enough, within a decade, nearly every state ratified that amendment, all but four states. So it has now since '92, been an amendment to the Constitution. Frankly, a not very relevant one because Congress has raised congressional salaries by ordinary legislation for more than 200 years. They didn't really need the amendment to do so. - [Kim] Looking back over the history of Constitutional amendments, you see that they kind of come in bunches."
Social Studies,"There are the ten that come immediately after the adoption of the Constitution. Then there are the Reconstruction amendments that come right after the Civil War. Then there are the Progressive-era amendments, ones like Prohibition or women's right to vote. Then there's been kind of a lull in Constitutional amendments This 1992 amendment is the 27th and final. So are there more amendments coming and if so, what might they be about? - [Fergus] Well, it's very difficult to amend the Constitution."
Social Studies,"That's one reason there are so few. There are other countries which have immensely long Constitutions and amend them all the time. We're extremely conservative as a nation historically in tampering with or altering our Constitution. Let's look at a couple of recent ones. There was the Equal Rights Amendment, an amendment to guarantee, across the board, equal rights to women, which almost passed. I believe it fell short by only one state, back in the 1970s. That came within a hair of being ratified."
Social Studies,"Another amendment that had some vigor in it in recent years was one to provide a voting member for the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia is not a state. It's a unique entity. The Constitution does not provide for the seat of government to be a state. So it's very tricky, legally and constitutionally, what is the District of Columbia. There was a proposed amendment that would enable D.C. to have a voting member."
Social Studies,"I think both of these amendments, which were proposed but were not ratified, may return. I do think at some point, D.C. will be given a status that enables it to have voting representation in Congress. I'm not sure what the formula will be. There is a renewed effort underway currently to reintroduce the Equal Rights Amendment. I think as women increasingly have a higher profile and more influence politically that the possibility of that one day becoming an amendment to the Constitution is foreseeable."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] One thing that we haven't discussed so far is that when the Bill of Rights originally was passed, it only applied to the federal government, not to the states. How does that intersect with these unadopted amendments? - [Fergus] Very important point."
Social Studies,"James Madison, who did more than any other member of Congress to shape what we now call the Bill of Rights, Madison argued that these amendments should also apply, and especially the protections of civil rights that we find in the First Amendment and others, that they should apply to states. He argued vigorously that they should be meant to apply to states. He failed, he wanted that to be explicit in the Bill of Rights."
Social Studies,"It is not, because the power of states rights within Congress was still so great in 1790, that states would not accept it. When did that change? The Reconstruction-era amendments, designed initially to provide rights for black Americans, for African Americans coming out of slavery, made clear that the Bill of Rights had to be applied across the board in states. Was it, practically speaking? No, it wasn't."
Social Studies,"In point of fact, those Reconstruction amendments were largely disregarded and ignored for many years, until the 20th century civil rights movement, particularly beginning in the 1950s, began to put federal muscle behind the enforcement of those amendments."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] And here, we're specifically discussing the 14th Amendment and its equal protection clause, which was passed after the Civil War to guarantee citizenship rights to African Americans but was really, as we know from the Jim Crow laws, something that existed on paper but not in reality. It took the work of civil rights groups and federal enforcement to make these rights that existed on paper, a reality. - [Fergus] Absolutely correct. It's really a modern notion."
Social Studies,"When I say modern, I mean a 20th century notion, that all Americans should expect to have equal rights in practice under the law. In the 19th century, equal rights were not enforced, regardless of what the Constitution or the Bill of Rights says. Without a federal government committed to it, they won't be enforced. - [Kim] So we've learned that there were more than 200 proposed amendments to the US Constitution, that James Madison whittled down to just 12."
Social Studies,"Of those, only ten were ratified at the time of the Framing. The unadopted amendments show us just how important ratification is to the amendment process. Even if an amendment is proposed and passed by Congress or a special convention of the states, to become law, three-quarters of the states must ratify it, which is really hard to do."
Social Studies,"What do you think the next Constitutional amendment will be? The Equal Rights Amendment? Representation for the District of Columbia, or something completely different?

Social Studies,Michael Klarman is a legal historian and the Kirkland and Ellis Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Kevin Walsh is a professor of law at the University if Richmond Law School.
Social Studies,"So, Professor Walsh, can you tell us a little bit about what was happening in this case? Can you set the stage? - [Kevin] Sure, you're right, the case wasn't decided until 1803, but to understand where it came from, you really have to go back to the election of 1800, and this election pitted John Adams, the incumbent, Federalist president, against his former vice president, Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic Republican."
Social Studies,"And long story short, Jefferson ended up being President, and we have skipped a lot of really interesting things there, but Jefferson ultimately won. The Federalist who controlled Congress, seeing what was happening, made a present for the incoming administration in the form of some laws that created some new judgeships. So some new federal judges, as well as some justices of the peace in the District of Columbia."
Social Studies,"And then they proceeded to stuff those offices with loyal Federalists, and these were people like William Marbury, who was granted a commission as justice of the peace in DC."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] Marbury was appointed by the Federalist President, the outgoing Federalist President, John Adams, to be a justice of the peace in Washington DC, but John Marshall, who was both Secretary of State and Chief Justice of the United States under John Adams, he didn't have a chance to deliver the commission, because these were midnight judges who were appointed almost at the last minute, as the Adams Administration was going out the door."
Social Studies,"So the commission for Marbury was still sitting on the desk of the new Secretary of State, James Madison, when the Jefferson Administration took over. And the Jeffersonians were outraged by what they saw as an effort to pack the judiciary by the outgoing administration, so they were refusing to deliver the commission."
Social Studies,"Marbury wants his commission, so he brings a lawsuit in the United States Supreme Court demanding that Secretary of State, James Madison, deliver the commission to him, and that's what leads to the case Marbury versus Madison. - [Kevin] So really, this is a case about some men trying to get the jobs that President Adams had appointed them to, but that they weren't able to get because President Jefferson and his administration refused to deliver the piece of paper entitling them to actually take the job."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Very interesting, so this election of 1800, I think, is very significant in American history because it was the first peaceful transfer of power between two political parties. The Federalists, kind of led by John Adams, who added this stronger central government as one of their core ideals, and then the anti-Federalists, or Democratic Republicans, led by Madison and Jefferson who wanted a weaker central government, more power to the states."
Social Studies,"So I think it's one of the coolest things in American history that a political party voluntarily gave up power, like when else in the history of the world did a ruling party just say, ah, you know what, now our enemies can rule. But, there's also this political fallout from this transfer of power between parties."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] And this is the first time that Jeffersonian Republicans are gonna be able to take control of the national government, and the Federalists, the outgoing Adams Administration, are horrified by this. They think of Jefferson as an anarchist, an atheist, they accused him during the campaign of being a miscegenator. They allege, it turns out correctly, that he sleeps with his slaves."
Social Studies,"They allege that in New England he'll be stealing their Bibles if elected, and the Jeffersonians don't think much better of John Adams. They think he wants to be a king. He nearly got the country into an unnecessary war with France. So there's tremendous political animosity. Neither side really sees the opposite side as the loyal political opposition, and then there's personal acrimony as well. Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall, both from Virginia, are distant cousins. They hate each other."
Social Studies,"John Marshall certainly didn't think Jefferson ought to be elected President in 1800, and Jefferson thinks that John Marshall as chief justice is trying to undermine the federal republic through his nationalist rulings on the Supreme Court. - [Kevin] Well, it wasn't a pretty transfer. John Adams left in a huff the morning that Jefferson was going to be inaugurated, but it was, as you say, it was a peaceful transition."
Social Studies,"But the thing is, is a lot of the issues that come with transferring power from one political party to another, these were new issues for the country. And understandably, the Jefferson Administration resented the Federalist's attempt to put their loyalists into the judiciary. - [Michael] The Jeffersonians have won the presidential election, they've won the congressional elections by even more."
Social Studies,"The only branch of the federal government still controlled by the Federalists is the judiciary, and now they're packing the judiciary. They're creating 16 new federal court of appeals judges, 42 new justices of the peace, they're actually diminishing the size of the Supreme Court from six to five so as to deprive Jefferson of an opportunity to appoint a new justice for one of those who is retiring. This is outrageous."
Social Studies,"And Jefferson also thinks it's outrageous that Marbury has filed a suit in the Supreme Court and has asked the Supreme Court to order the President of the United States to do something, which Jefferson thinks is a violation of the separation of powers. - [Kim] So, William Marbury is one of these judges that John Adams had appointed in the midnight hour."
Social Studies,"He decides to sue, and this is directly to the Supreme Court, right? 'Cause it's in the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction? - [Kevin] Okay, so he sues directly in the Supreme Court. Right now we think of the Supreme Court generally as a court that hears appeals, right? Usually you don't go there in the first instance. But as we said, this was a new thing. And it was also new to be suing the executive branch."
Social Studies,"So it makes sense, if you think about it, if you're going after the President and the President's Secretary of State to go directly to the Supreme Court. - [Michael] Marbury brought the suit in the Supreme Court, but the question and the case is whether the Supreme Court can here this within its constitutional original jurisdiction."
Social Studies,"So under the Article III of the constitution, at least as John Marshall chooses to interpret it, in Marbury versus Madison, this particular case can't be in the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. It could only be filed somewhere else and then appealed to the Supreme Court. - [Kim] So John Marshall's a pretty big figure in the history of the Supreme Court. Can you tell us just a little bit more about who he is and why he's so important? - [Kevin] Sure, he is still the longest serving chief justice."
Social Studies,"John Marshall was chief justice from 1801 to 1835. He was appointed by President Adams in early 1801. This was one of the final acts of Adams' administration, and he went on to say that it was the proudest thing he had done for the American people. Marshall was a Federalist from Virginia. So this made him a little bit odd, because the leading political figures in Virginia were Democratic Republicans. But Marshall had been a soldier in the Continental Army."
Social Studies,"He was at Valley Forge with Washington and with Hamilton, and his experience is under the Continental Congress and under the Articles of Confederation, and then later serving in state government in Virginia, made him realize that we needed a much stronger national government. And that's what turned him into a Federalist. So he was really in the mold of Washington and Hamilton. And so this put him at odds with the new President Jefferson when Jefferson took office."
Social Studies,"Nevertheless, over the course of the three and a half decades that he was on the Supreme Court, Marshall gained a reputation for being above politics, above party, and he was really successful in bringing the court together as an institution, to speak usually with one voice, for the constitution. So his great success was to identify himself with the Court, to identify the Court with the Constitution, and to identify the Constitution with the people."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] All right, so Marbury sues for his commission as a federal judge, and then Marshall and the Supreme Court are tasked with this issue of figuring out whether Marbury should get his commission or not. So can you take us through Marshall's thinking? How did he reason his way to the answer in this case? - [Michael] So there are two different dimensions to Marshall's thinking. One is the dimension of a lawyer, and the other is the dimension of a political strategist."
Social Studies,"Marshall understands that if he issues an order to the Jefferson Administration to deliver the commission he will be defied. He knows that almost to a certainty. James Madison has refused even to show up in court in response to an order to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not be issued. - [Kevin] So mandamus is from the same root as mandatory or mandate, right? It's an order."
Social Studies,"And here the issue was did the judiciary have the power using this writ of mandamus, to order the Secretary of State to do something. - [Michael] So Marshall has to figure out, what can he do that isn't gonna make the court look hopelessly weak, if he just says there's no jurisdiction then people are gonna think he's supine and he's afraid to challenge the President."
Social Studies,"But if he orders the President to deliver the commission, which is what he'd like to do, he knows Jefferson will defy him, and he has no authority, he has no enforcement capacity. So then the court will just look impotent. So what he wants to do instead is, he wants to act by indirection. The first thing he says is, the President's not above the law. The President can be mandamused. The second thing he says, in this particular case a writ of mandamus would be the appropriate remedy."
Social Studies,"But the third thing he says is, I have to ask whether I have jurisdiction in this case. - [Kevin] The problem is, the list of cases in the Constitution that can be heard by the Supreme Court in its original jurisdiction did not include cases like Marbury's. So this was a problem because Congress had passed a law purportedly telling the Supreme Court that it could hear cases like this. - [Kim] Ah, okay. - [Kevin] That's what Marbury was relying on."
Social Studies,"Right? He wasn't just thinking, oh I'm gonna go to the biggest court in the country. He was relying on a federal statute that seemed to give the court jurisdiction. But Marshall said that statute conflicts with what the Constitution says. It goes beyond the limits set for this court in the Constitution. And when you have a conflict between the Constitution and a federal law or any law, the Constitution wins. Right? So this is the principle that has been called Judicial Review."
Social Studies,"The idea is you have to review the laws to make sure they comply with the Constitution. And if a law is unconstitutional it can't be enforced by the Supreme Court. So it's a long way of saying that Marbury lost because the court didn't have jurisdiction. The court didn't have jurisdiction because the law that said it had jurisdiction was unconstitutional. - [Kim] Wow, okay."
Social Studies,"So there's a lot going on here, but one of the big takeaways is this notion of Judicial Review, or the idea that the Constitution wins and it's up to the Supreme Court to decide whether that's the case. Can you talk more about the affects of Judicial Review? How does it check the power of the other branches of government? - [Kevin] In order for a law to be enforced against anybody, all three branches of the government have to have taken some kind of action."
Social Studies,"So Congress had to have passed a law and the President has to sign it. Then the law has to be enforced against somebody in a way that gives rise to a legal case. And then the judiciary gets the final word in that legal case as to whether the law is constitutional. So the one way that Judicial Review operates as a check on the President and the executive, is providing a backstop against the enforcement of unconstitutional laws."
Social Studies,"- [Michael] So when the courts strike down President Trump's travel ban, that's Judicial Review. Or when the Supreme Court said President Truman exceeded his authority in ordering the seizure of the steal mills during the Korean War, that's Judicial Review. Or when the Supreme Court recently almost struck down the Affordable Care Act, that would be an exercise of Judicial Review."
Social Studies,"- [ Kim] Interesting, so this case and perhaps just Marshall as chief justice, in general made the court, I think much more powerful than it had been. Do you think this new power for the court or expansion of power for the court would have surprised the framers? - [Michael] At the Philadelphia Convention, more of the framers spoke in favor of Judicial Review than against, but the issue didn't come up very much."
Social Studies,"There wasn't that concerted a discussion of it, and they neglected to explicitly authorize the practice and the Constitution, which was kind of an oversight. It's just not a subject they spent a great deal of time talking about. And even to the extent they believed in Judicial Review, they probably didn't think the practice would be anywhere near as extensive as it's become over the course of American history."
Social Studies,"The Supreme Court just wasn't that powerful an institution in 1803, and the fact that it was declaring the power of Judicial Review, but then was declining to exercise it in Marbury is very revealing of how lacking in power the court was. - [Kevin] This was the first time that the Supreme Court exercised this power of Judicial Review, and it is something that everyone agrees, a power that everyone agrees that the Supreme Court has."
Social Studies,"And it's a big awesome power, and so it affects us because we're still arguing over how that power should be exercised, and that is an argument worth having. - [Kim] So we learned that far from simply being a case about one man's commission getting lost in the mail, Marbury versus Madison tested whether the President or Congress was above the law in the United States. Chief justice John Marshall's answer was emphatically no."
Social Studies,"And the decision in this case established an essential precedent for the Supreme Court, the power of Judicial Review. To learn more about Marbury versus Madison, check out the National Constitutional Center's interactive Constitution and Kahn Academy's resources on US Government and Politics.."
Social Studies,"To learn more, I sought out the help of two experts. Randy Barnett is the Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at the Georgetown University Law Center and Director of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution. Neil Siegel is the David W. Ichel Professor of Law and Professor of Political Science at Duke Law School."
Social Studies,"So, Professor Barnett, could you kind of set the stage for us, what was happening in this case? What was the overall context? - Well, McCulloch versus Maryland was a culmination of a 30-year old constitutional controversy."
Social Studies,"In fact, it was the culmination of one of the earliest controversies that we had in the country, and that is over whether Congress had the power to establish a national bank, a bank that would be a corporation formed by Congress and which would have certain privileges that Congress granted it."
Social Studies,"This was a proposal that had been made by Alexander Hamilton when he was Secretary of the Treasury in the Washington administration in the very first year of the Washington administration, and it went to Congress, and there was a very, very robust debate in Congress as to whether this measure was within the powers of Congress to enact."
Social Studies,"Eventually, Congress voted that it was, and then before he signed the bill, President Washington asked some of his cabinet members to give him their opinion on whether it was constitutional, and he heard from several of his cabinet members. He heard from his Attorney General, Edmund Randolph, he said it was unconstitutional. He heard from his Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, Jefferson said it was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"And finally, he heard from his Secretary of Treasury, who had proposed it, Alexander Hamilton, who said it was constitutional. And Washington signed the bill and it became law. And it established the First National Bank of the United States. - [Siegel] This case arose in May of 1818 when Maryland sued McCulloch, and he was the cashier at the Baltimore branch of the bank. And Maryland sued him in state court to recover a tax assessed by Maryland on the bank."
Social Studies,"And this was a time of intense hostility towards the national bank in a number of states. The state banks competed with the national bank, and there had been an economic panic in 1818, when the U.S. bank halted its loans and state banks that had loans from the federal bank were crippled. And in response, a number of states passed nearly annhilative taxes on the federal bank, and that's the environment in which, in 1819, McCulloch against Maryland came before the Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] I find this very interesting, because this is something that we talk a lot about in the early 19th century, the Bank of the United States. And what was good about it and what was bad about it. And there are certain people who were certainly enemies of the bank, like Thomas Jefferson, and then later, Andrew Jackson. Why did people object to the Bank of the United States so much? - [Siegel] Yeah, there were a variety of objections."
Social Studies,"There was a real political policy disagreement about whether it was a good idea. Hamilton had a nation-building, economy-building objective as the first Secretary of the Treasury. He wanted to pay off both the national debt and the state debts from the Revolutionary War, which remained unpaid. He was emphasizing manufacturing and commerce and a national bank was a key part of his plan."
Social Studies,"The bank would make it easier for the national government to raise taxes, to pay off debts, to make payments, to obtain short-term loans. The notes issued by the bank could function as a national currency, it could also provide a source of capital for financing businesses. But the opponents had different ideas. - [Barnett] One of the leading opponents in Congress was James Madison, who at the time was a representative from Orange County, Virginia."
Social Studies,"And what concerned him, and I think it's what concerned many people, was no expressed enumerated power in the Constitution for Congress to make a bank. There was an enumerated power to create a post office, but there was no enumerated power to create a bank. So the question is whether the failure or the silence of the Constitution on whether there was this power should be construed in favor of having such a power, or not having such a power."
Social Studies,"And Madison's concern was that to imply such a power, especially when the way in which it was being implied was very remotely connected to one of the enumerated powers that were in the Constitution, was very dangerous because by that form of reasoning, Congress can essentially do whatever it wished, and that would violate the basic pledge that this was going to be a national government of limited and enumerated powers."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So in Congress, what was the power that proponents of the bank used to justify passing it? - [Barnett] The principle power that they used is called the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Necessary and Proper Clause says Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution its foregoing powers, those powers on the list, and all other powers vested by the Constitution in the government of the United States or any department or officer thereof."
Social Studies,"This is called the Necessary and Proper Clause. It allows for Congress to make laws incidental to the enumerated powers to effectuate, or carry into execution, those powers. And supporters of the bill said that the bank carried into execution a number of powers, it carried into execution the taxing power, it carried into execution the commerce power. The opponents of the bank said, well, it may do that, but it only does that in a very attenuated way."
Social Studies,"And therefore, if it can do this in order to effectuate that power, then it pretty much can do anything to effectuate power, and therefore it can pretty much do anything. And that's a big problem. - [Kim] So Maryland sues McCulloch, and then what happens? - [Siegel] Maryland sues McCulloch, because Maryland didn't pass the annihilative tax, it was a tax of around two percent of the banknotes issued by the National Bank."
Social Studies,"And Maryland won in the state trial court, and Maryland won in the state supreme court, and this was really not a surprise at the time, - (laughter) state courts were, let's just say, solicitous of the views of the state and after the state supreme court decided, the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court on appeal."
Social Studies,"So even though Maryland sues McCulloch, by the time it gets to the Supreme Court, it's called McCulloch against Maryland because McCulloch, the cashier at the Baltimore branch, is now the petitioner, he's requesting the U.S. Supreme Court review of the decision of the Maryland high court. And McCulloch is asking the Supreme Court to intervene and, in essence, side with the federal government over the state. - [Kim] Interesting."
Social Studies,"So what are the constitutional issues at stake once the McCulloch case gets to the Supreme Court? - [Barnett] Well, the Supreme Court in a very lengthy opinion has to consider a couple of different matters. First it has to consider whether the states have the power to tax a federal entity like a bank."
Social Studies,"And that's where you have the famous statement by John Marshall that says, ""the power to tax can be the power to destroy."" What he's talking about is the power of states to tax a federal entity like a bank, might be the power of states to destroy a federal entity, and he ruled against that claim. And he basically argued that states couldn't have that kind of power."
Social Studies,"- [Siegel] And a threshold question before the Supreme Court decides that question of state authority to tax the national government, is whether the national bank can exist to begin with. Is there federal power to create a national bank? Part of what Maryland is arguing is that there's no federal power to create the bank, and so in fact, this taxation that it's engaging in is unproblematic."
Social Studies,"The first question is whether the federal government can create the bank, and if the answer is no, then the case is over. If the answer is yes, then you get to the second question of whether the states can tax this part of the federal government, the national bank. - [Kim] So at this time, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is John Marshall, very well-known as being kind of the Chief Justice that brought the Supreme Court to be a major player in the U.S. governmental system."
Social Studies,"How did he interpret what was going on, what did he and the other justices decide? - [Siegel] He borrowed extensively from Hamilton's arguments. And so Marshall adopted Hamilton's arguments in defense of the constitutionality of the bank, that Hamilton originally articulated back in 1790, 1791. So the court held an opinion by the great Chief Justice, first, that Congress does possess the authority to create the bank and secondly, that states have no authority to tax the bank."
Social Studies,"- [Barnett] And that is what Marshall concluded was within Congress' power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact. And in fact, when it got to the court in McCulloch versus Maryland, it was the state of Maryland who basically adopted the Jeffersonian approach and said that a measure must be, in its words, indispensably requisite, or what you might call absolutely necessary in order for it to be constitutional. And whereas the defenders of the bank bill said that it could be a lot less than that."
Social Studies,"So, I think there's basically three positions that you can have. It has to be indispensably requisite, or logically necessary, that's the Jefferson and Maryland view. It could be merely a matter of convenience or expediency, meaning basically Congress can do whatever it wants. That's the liberal view that's sometimes attributed to John Marshall in McCulloch versus Maryland, but he denied it."
Social Studies,"And there's the in-between position that I think both Madison and Hamilton were favoring, and that is the requirement of some degree of means-ends fit, so that a measure really is aimed at a particular end, and it's not really trying to accomplish something that Congress isn't given the power over."
Social Studies,"- [Siegel] What I think is less well-known about this case is that this part of the case was over and the court had already decided, that this federal power to create the bank, before it even got to the Necessary and Proper Clause. This case is a great example of what's called Structural Constitutional Interpretation. Hamilton articulated two structural principles. First, that the federal government is supreme within it's sphere of action."
Social Studies,"And second, if some kind of end is within federal power, is listed in the Constitution, then any convenient or useful means to accomplishing that end is also within the scope. And so Marshall decides that drawing inferences from his understanding of the theory and structure of government created by the Constitution, and only after he does that, does he then turn to the Necessary and Proper Clause to confirm what he has already deduced through what he calls general reasoning."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So, McCulloch versus Maryland is frequently paired with Marbury versus Madison as being two cases that really decide the extent of federal power in this early era. Do you think these two cases are related? What do they tell us about the ideas at this time period about federal power? - [Barnett] Well, they're very important. I don't think they are quite as extreme as they've come to be read after the New Deal."
Social Studies,"When the New Deal Court and the rest of advocates for a New Deal were going back into the past and seeking justifications for what they wanted to do, they read McCulloch versus Maryland very broadly. They also read Marbury versus Madison, actually they read Marbury versus Madison, in some respects, very narrowly because they didn't want courts invalidating their New Deal legislations. Marbury versus Madison was not a huge deal at the time it was decided."
Social Studies,The idea that judges had a duty to follow the higher law when it was in conflict with the mere statute was widely accepted at the time of the founding. And so Marbury was not announcing a new policy.
Social Studies,"McCulloch versus Maryland, on the other hand, was extremely controversial when it was decided, and in fact quite oddly, James Madison, who had signed the bill authorizing the second bank into law, greatly, strenuously objected to John Marshall's opinion in McCulloch versus Maryland upholding the bill that Madison had signed into law."
Social Studies,"So, Madison still maintained that Marshall had a latitudinarian or overly-broad interpretation of federal power even in upholding the bill that Madison, by this time, had come to believe was constitutional. - [Kim] So what ultimately happened with the Bank of the United States? - [Siegel] What ultimately happened is both the bill creating the First Bank and the Second Bank had what's called a sunset provision, which means after a certain amount of time, and it was 20 years, it expires."
Social Studies,"And so to reauthorize it, it puts the burden on inertia on those who want the thing to continue. And so Congress had to pass another bill reauthorizing the bank, and President Andrew Jackson opposed reauthorization. - [Barnett] President Andrew Jackson vetoed the reauthorization of the bank, and it was very interesting because he vetoed it on constitutional grounds, he said it was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"And yet, what happened in McCulloch versus Maryland, if McCulloch versus Maryland said the bank was constitutional, how could President Jackson say that it was unconstitutional? Well, it was interesting."
Social Studies,"Because what McCulloch said was that the bank was constitutional as an exercise of Congress' power to make laws that are necessary and proper, that Congress believed was necessary and proper, and because Congress believed it was necessary, and because the measure was plainly adapted to a legitimate end in the Constitution, then it was constitutional."
Social Studies,"What Jackson said was, hey look, the court said that it's up to Congress to decide whether something is necessary and therefore constitutional, and I as president exercise a veto power as part of the legislative process, therefore, it is up to me to decide whether the measure is necessary and therefore is constitutional, so I as president have decided that a bank is not necessary and therefore, because the bank is not necessary, it is unconstitutional, and McCulloch versus Maryland allows me as a participant in the legislative process to make that call."
Social Studies,- [Siegel] Congress did not override Jackson's veto and the bank expired and the story ended in 1836. And I think this speaks to one of many morals of the story of the Bank of the United States. The Supreme Court doesn't have the last word on Constitutional questions when it upholds exercises of federal power. It's then left to the political process to decide whether or not it wants to continue whatever controversial action or legislation was at issue.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So is there any aspect of McCulloch versus Maryland that still affects us today? - [Barnett] One reading of McCulloch is that it gives Congress a power so broad, that allows Congress to exercise any power that it deems convenient to the exercise of one of its enumerated powers, that is how McCulloch has come to be interpreted. I think that is an over-reading of McCulloch."
Social Studies,"And it also overlooks one of the key passages of McCulloch versus Maryland that nowadays is given no legal effect by the Supreme Court. This is what John Marshall said: should Congress, under the pretext of executing its powers, pass laws for the accomplishments of objects not entrusted to the government, it would become the painful duty of this tribunal, should a case requiring such a decision come before it, to say that such an act was not the law of the land."
Social Studies,"So what Marshall is saying there is that just because Congress says a law is necessary to one of its enumerated powers, doesn't make it so."
Social Studies,"And if there is a lack of fit between means and ends suggesting that in fact Congress is trying to pursue one of the powers that was not given to it under the Constitution, it really would be the painful duty of the tribunal to say it was not the law of the land, and that's what connects this case back up with Marbury versus Madison, in which it is the painful duty of the Supreme Court to say that a statute is not the law of the land if it's unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"That aspect of McCulloch versus Maryland is no longer followed in part because during the New Deal, the Supreme Court said it would not inquire into the motives of Congress in enacting laws. And in fact, what McCulloch is saying here is to inquire into the motives, it's to say, hey look, it purports to be doing one thing but it's really doing something else and that is pre-textual."
Social Studies,"- [Siegel] There has been irreconcilable disagreement on basic Constitutional questions from the very beginning of the Constitution. Madison and Hamilton, who come together and write the Federalist Papers, they disagree about this fundamental question of strict versus loose construction of Congress' enumerated powers. They also disagree about Congress' spending powers, they disagree about inherent executive power."
Social Studies,"So sometimes, originalist constitutional arguments presuppose a greater degree of consensus about what the Constitution means at the start of the country that I don't see when I study the history. We have always disagreed. We've always managed to find some kind of community in disagreement. It's the conflicts and disagreements that have binded us together as much, if not more, than the agreements we've had about what the Constitution means."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that McCulloch versus Maryland was about far more than just a tax on a bank. It bolstered the power of the federal government by broadly defining the Necessary and Proper Clause and by confirming that federal law is supreme to state law. To learn more about McCulloch versus Maryland, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and politics.."
Social Studies,"Originally a case about whether one man ought to be free, Dred Scott versus Sandford transformed into a case about African-American citizenship and the future of the institution of slavery itself. To learn more, I sought out help of two experts. Christopher Bracey is a Professor of Law at the George Washington University School of Law. He's an expert in US race relations, individual rights and criminal procedure. Timothy Huebner is the Irma O."
Social Studies,"Sternberg Professor of History at Rhodes College and the author of Liberty and Union: The Civil War Era and American Constitutionalism. Professor Bracey can you take us through a little bit, just who was Dred Scott and why did he bring this case? - [Christopher] So Dred Scott was born around 1800 and was the slave of Peter and Elizabeth Taylor Blow. In 1818, Peter Blow decides to move his family and Dred Scott to Alabama where he'd bought a cotton plantation."
Social Studies,"That didn't go so well, so he sells the plantation and moves the family and Dred to St. Louis, Missouri, where he'd purchased a boarding house called The Jefferson Hotel. - [Timothy] And that period really was a period during which the nation was arguing over the status of slaves and the rights of slaveholders and the future of slavery in new western territories."
Social Studies,"And this issue came up in a very significant way and a very controversial way in the question of the future of slavery in the territory and ultimately the state of Missouri. After two years of arguing over this, finally in 1820 and 1821, a sort of compromise was set out by members of Congress. North of the southern border of Missouri, with the exception of the state of Missouri, slavery would be banned. - [Christopher] In 1830, Elizabeth Taylor Blow dies and Peter himself dies two years later."
Social Studies,"But before he does, he makes an arrangement to sell Dred to an Army physician by the name of Dr. Emerson. Dr. Emerson is an Army physician, so he's gonna be stationed in a lot of different places, not just in the slave state of Missouri. In fact, it turns out that Dr. Emerson's first posting with Dred takes him to Fort Armstrong, which is located in Rock Island, Illinois and Illinois is of course a free state."
Social Studies,"Under both federal law and Missouri law as understood at the time, Dred would have lost his slave status and become a free man as soon as he stepped foot onto free territory. This was known as the Extra-territorial Emancipation Doctrine. - [Timothy] It was perfectly legal and perfectly possible for a slave sojourner, a slave who had been taken into a free state or free territory, to file suit for his freedom. - [Christopher] Dr. Emerson marries Eliza Irene Sandford of St. Louis. Dr."
Social Studies,"Emerson eventually dies in 1843 and he leaves the entire estate, including the Scotts, to Mrs. Emerson. Mrs. Emerson decides she would like to hire Dred out to make some money for herself. Rather than be hired out, Dred offers to purchase his own freedom, and the freedom of his entire family. But Mrs. Emerson refuses to allow Dred to buy out the freedom of his family. So Dred Scott files a civil lawsuit, what was called a Freedom Suit back then, in the Missouri State court. And his claim was that Mrs."
Social Studies,"Emerson was falsely imprisoning him and his family. - [Timothy] And he was able to do this with the help of the sons of his formers owners. - [Christopher] The lawyer is being paid by the children of Peter and Elizabeth Taylor Blow, - [Narrator] Wow. Dred Scott's first master. In the meantime you have a new development, Mrs. Emerson has remarried to Republican congressman Calvin Chaffee, from Massachusetts and he can't be a slave owner and still be a Republican congressman from Massachusetts. So Mrs."
Social Studies,"Emerson transfers title of the Scotts to her brother John Sandford who is a resident of New York, with business ties in St. Louis. - [Timothy] Now it was eligible for the case to go into Federal Court in that it involved people who lived in two different states."
Social Studies,"- [Christopher] So now you might be thinking, ""Well, filing a lawsuit against your purported master, that's pretty brave stuff."" But as it turns out freedoms suits of this nature were not that uncommon, particularly in border states where the slavery question was hotly disputed. Indeed there were some 300 or so of these freedom suits that were filed in Missouri during the period in which Dred Scott filed his case."
Social Studies,Many people viewed the Missouri Compromise as not so much of a compromise but as something that was forced upon the slave states. And then you've got the Kansas-Nebraska Act which gave similar autonomy to those areas to decide the slavery question and whether or not it would be introduced into those territories.
Social Studies,"- [Narrator] Interesting, so people in the North who opposed slavery or at the very least didn't want slavery to expand, would have been looking in the 1850s and saying, ""Hey I thought we already decided this, there wouldn't be slavery north of this line and now you're saying maybe Kansas and Nebraska could be slave states."" - [Timothy] Right and that was a huge issue in national politics because northerners are starting to grow very suspicious of southerners on the slavery issue."
Social Studies,"They're starting to speak of what they called the slave power, that southern slaveholders held all of this power in Washington and that they were running the show. And that this 1854 act had made it possible for slavery to potentially expand into an area where previously it had been banned."
Social Studies,- [Christopher] And you really do get this escalation of tension and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 which basically forced requirements upon free states to ensure the longevity of the slave states by requiring them to undertake certain behaviors and the return of fugitive slaves only escalated the tension and concern about the status of slavery in American life.
Social Studies,"- [Narrator] Alright so we're in this incredibly tense time of the 1850s with the slavery question yet unanswered and Dred Scott and his case gets to the Supreme Court. So how does the Supreme Court rule on this? - [Christopher] In a seven to two ruling, the Supreme Court held that Dred Scott was not a citizen of the United States, and so therefore he could not bring his freedom suit before federal court, which is really a jurisdictional question."
Social Studies,"But then the Court also goes on to invalidate the Missouri Compromise, despite finding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. - [Timothy] What happens when the case is being argued is that one of the arguments that's introduced is this idea that when Scott had been taken into free territory, he wasn't necessarily free because the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"And so what the Court ends up doing is not only ruling on the status of Scott, but also on the status of slavery in these federal territories in the west and the extent of the powers of Congress over slavery in the west. - [Narrator] Interesting so Chief Justice Roger Taney is then leading the Supreme Court and he, I guess, leads the reasoning about this case."
Social Studies,"So what were some of the arguments that he eventually accepted and made in his decision? - [Timothy] Chief Justice Taney's a very interesting figure. He had been on the court for many years. He, in his early years, had been moderately anti-slavery, had freed most of his own slaves, and had made anti-slavery statements. But by 1857 Taney reflected the larger change that had taken place within his political party, Taney was a Democrat."
Social Studies,"And the Democratic party had become more Southern dominated and more pro-slavery. And Taney then, by 1857, really is a symbol of pro-slavery Southern thought. - [Christopher] Justice Taney's opinion is somewhat notorious. He makes a series of arguments and one is legal, the others are really not legal arguments as I'll explain. What he starts out by saying is that just because you're a citizen of a state, that does not make you a citizen of the United States."
Social Studies,He says basically the federal government has exclusive authority to decide who is a citizen of the United States. Then he makes a second argument and he says even if Dred Scott were a citizen of the state of Missouri he would not be a citizen of the United States because he's black. And what he meant by that is that the word citizen as used in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence categorically excluded members of the Negro race.
Social Studies,"- [Narrator] This is fascinating because it seems to me like Justice Taney may have been ignoring a long history of free people of color in the United States who had voting rights, who had property rights. - [Timothy] He was and that was part of the criticism of the majority opinion that comes in, especially the dissent written by Justice Benjamin Curtis."
Social Studies,"Curtis had the lengthier of the two dissents and the more thorough legal argument because, as you point out, that in five states at the time of the founding, that African-Americans did exercise the right to vote that was a sign or some sort of an indication of their status as citizens."
Social Studies,"And so the argument made by Justice Curtis then, is that Taney's reading of history was that the founders had not intended for African-Americans to be part of the people or the citizens that were referred to in the text of the US Constitution."
Social Studies,"- [Christopher] What Justice Taney has done here has basically created a blind spot for himself and he goes on to point out that this is not his belief, this belief in Negro inferiority, but he said that it was a fixed and universal belief within the civilized portion of the white race, he said it was an axiom, a truth. But what's interesting is that he says this without a citation."
Social Studies,"He says that these aren't his views, these are the views of the framers, the great men who were high in literary accomplishment, high in their sense of honor. He said that they perfectly understood the language that they used, and how it would be understood by others."
Social Studies,"And there's this great quote in the opinion where he says that they, the framers, knew that it would not in any part of the civilized world be supposed to embrace the Negro race, which by common consent had been excluded from civilized governments and the family of nations and doomed to slavery. What Justice Taney has done here, is he's attempted to rewrite history."
Social Studies,"- [Narrator] So how the American people respond to the Dred Scott decision at large? Where they generally for it, or aghast by it? - [Timothy] Well as you might expect, things were split exactly down the middle. What we see in the South is white Southerners believe that the ruling is a vindication of what they had been arguing. Southerners had been arguing for many years going back to John C. Calhoun, that Southerners and that Southern slave holders had a bundle of rights."
Social Studies,And they argued that they had the right to own slaves as property in the southern states. They argued that they had a right to recapture fugitive slaves who escaped into the north and they also argued that they had a right to take slaves into the west. And so Southerners then feel that the Court and the US Constitution are on their side.
Social Studies,"You see a lot of folks in the north who are hostile to what the Court has done, because once again they see it as further evidence that the Court is dominated by the Democratic party, by the slave power. And many of these folks then are going to be members of a new party, and that was of course the Republican Party."
Social Studies,"- [Christopher] I think the abolitionists were furious and I think Frederick Douglas' statement calling it a brazen misstatement of facts of history, a scandalous and devilish perversion of the Constitution resonated and even future Presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, that same summer that the case was decided, went out and denounced it publicly. - [Narrator] So Lincoln of course wins the election of November 1860 which becomes a precipitating event of the Civil War."
Social Studies,"Do you see the Dred Scott decision as being a really important cause of the Civil War? - [Timothy] Yeah so these things are all linked, absolutely. Think about the ruling by Taney in Dred Scott ruling that slave-holders rights are absolute. Taney rules African-Americans have no rights, slaveholders have total rights. This makes it possible for Lincoln to rise as a political leader in the north because he has something that he can strongly criticize."
Social Studies,"Lincoln basically makes the argument that the founders had hoped for slavery to disappear ultimately. And Taney's making exactly the opposite argument. So the interesting thing is, if you think about how this story ends, it ends in March of 1861 when Abraham Lincoln is sworn-in as the 16th President. And who swears him in? Of course Roger B. Taney."
Social Studies,"So between the time when Lincoln was elected in November of 1860 and the time when he takes that oath of office in March of 1861, seven Southern slave-holding states, those are the states that leave the Federal Union first. Four other states of course will join them, but not until after the Civil War has already started. - [Narrator] So there's no Compromise of 1860, instead what we get is a four-year long Civil War where more than 620,000 Americans are killed."
Social Studies,"And at the end of that war, the North, the United States is victorious and slavery in the 13th Amendment is abolished forever. How does the end of the Civil War relate back to the Dred Scott case? - [Timothy] The 13th Amendment ends slavery, the 14th Amendment has to undermine or overturn the other part of the Supreme Court's ruling which was this issue of the rights of those who previously had been held as slaves."
Social Studies,"And the 14th Amendment is going to do that work by stating that all who were born in this country, by virtue of their birth here are citizens and that they have rights that will be protected by the Federal government. And if you think about it, what has changed, what has shifted, is the whole national discourse of rights, from the emphasis on the rights of slaveholders that we see in 1857, to an emphasis on the rights of those who previously had been held as slaves."
Social Studies,"And arguably then what we see during the Civil War and Reconstruction is the advent of a new discourse focusing on human rights. And that I would argue is profoundly significant. - [Narrator] So what happened to Dred Scott after this? Did he and his wife live to see the end of the Civil War and the end of slavery? - [Christopher] Unfortunately Dred Scott did not. The Supreme Court renders its decision in 1857 but he dies, unfortunately in 1858. His wife Harriet though, lives on to about 1876."
Social Studies,"So she did live to see the end of the Civil War and the end of slavery. The Dred Scott case made clear, at the time, that the struggle for citizenship and of course the later struggle for civil rights, is about the desire to be treated with equal dignity, to be viewed as possessing equal humanity."
Social Studies,"And what is perhaps most moving, I think, about the Dred Scott case is the dignity with which the Scotts carried themselves throughout the entire ordeal, despite the Court's best efforts to deprive them of that dignity. It was ultimately Dred and Harriet who gained the respect of the nation. And it was the inhumanity of the Court and the institution of slavery that was laid bare for all to see."
Social Studies,- [Narrator] So we've learned that the ruling in Dred Scott helped bring about the Civil War by further dividing the North and South over the issue of slavery. Opposition to the case's outcome propelled Abraham Lincoln to the national political stage and opposition to Abraham Lincoln propelled slave states to secede after his election as President. But the Dred Scott case was also about the lives and fates of one man and his family.
Social Studies,"Although Dred didn't survive to see the end of slavery and the passage of the 14th Amendment granting equal citizenship to African-Americans, his family lived to see the rewards of the struggle he began. To learn more about the Dred Scott case, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution and Khan Academy's resources on US history.."
Social Studies,"And today, we're learning more about the landmark case, Plessy versus Ferguson, which asks whether separate but equal accommodations for Black and White Americans violated the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. To learn more about this case, I spoke with two experts. Jamal Greene is the Dwight Professor of Law at Columbia Law School. Earl Maltz is a Distinguished Professor of Law at Rutgers Law School."
Social Studies,"So Professor Greene, could you kind of set the stage for us in this time period? After the Civil War, what was the legal and social status of former slaves? - [Jamal] Well, of course, the Civil War ended in 1865. And it was fought in large part over the institution of chattel slavery, so slavery of, generally speaking, Black or African American slaves. And right at the end of the Civil War, the 13th Amendment was passed."
Social Studies,"And the 13th Amendment basically said that there shouldn't be any slavery or involuntary servitude in the United States. So the institution of slavery itself had ended, but the passage of the 13th Amendment did not mean that former slaves had equal rights."
Social Studies,"A number of the former states of the Confederacy, the, generally speaking, Southern states, passed a number of racially discriminatory laws immediately after the end of slavery that prevented Black Americans from participating in civil society on equal terms with Whites. For example, laws restricting the ability of Blacks to enter into and enforce contracts, restricting the ability of Blacks to own property, to sit on juries, to vote, to testify in court, and so forth."
Social Studies,"So there were a number of openly discriminatory laws. There were also laws that required Blacks to be employed on pain of having their labor forced, so ways of essentially re-instituting the institution of slavery. - [Kim] And these were known as the Black Codes. - [Jamal] Those were known as the Black Codes, exactly."
Social Studies,"- [Earl] In the Reconstruction period between say the late 1860s and the mid 1870s, there was a concerted effort by the federal government to improve the social status and political rights of African Americans. In 1876, there was part of the settlement of the presidential election of 1876, the federal government drew back some. But most of the so-called Redeemer movement really took off in the 1890s."
Social Studies,"I think 1891 is when the last real effort is made by the federal government to have a serious Voting Rights Act. After that, the South is pretty much under control of the people who sympathized with ex-Confederates. - [Jamal] In both Northern and Southern states, there was widespread racial segregation. So there were laws that were basically codifying long-existing social practices of segregated housing, segregated schools, and segregated public conveyances like steamships and rail cars."
Social Studies,"But much of that changed in the years immediately following the Civil War. Congress passed a number of federal laws that banned racial discrimination, particularly in contracting and in housing. Quite significantly, in addition to the actual federal laws that Congress passed, the country passed and ratified the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So I think one thing that is very hard for me to understand and that I've seen students struggle with is you have the passage of the 14th Amendment and the 15th Amendment in 1868, 1870. And these are supposed to guarantee equal protection and citizenship and voting rights for African Americans, specifically men in the 15th Amendment. And then, you have Jim Crow."
Social Studies,"So how did we get from this moment after the Civil War where things really seem like they're looking up in terms of African American citizenship to the system of Jim Crow that's going to persist into the 1960s and 70s. - [Jamal] The Civil War did not end racism. It simply ended slavery. And so, we're still living in a racist society in which residential and school segregation remained both in Southern states and in Northern states notwithstanding the Civil Rights Amendments."
Social Studies,"And in Southern states, Reconstruction, the process of trying to bring former slaves fully into civil society, was enforced by the presence of federal troops in Southern states on the theory, the very well-founded theory, that states that had just gone to war in order to perpetuate the institution of slavery were not going to willingly adopt equal rights for the former slaves that they had just been holding in bondage."
Social Studies,"And so, there was a federal military occupation of a number of former Confederate states for a good decade plus after the Civil War really ending in 1877. - [Earl] And at that point, again through the Redeemer movement, people who were the White power structure, most of which had sympathized with the Secessionist Movement, the White power structure and its successors took power back in the beginning and mid 1870s in the Southern states. And as part of their campaign, they imposed the Jim Crow system."
Social Studies,"- [Jamal] Slavery was not just about labor. It was really a system of racial hierarchy. And many in the United States remained committed to that system even after bondage itself ended. And if you don't have the political will within the Northern states to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments, you had really a retrenchment of deep racial inequality within the Southern states, but not just within the Southern states, but also within a number of Northern states as well."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So let's kind of dial into the case Plessy versus Ferguson. Who was Homer Plessy? And why did he take issue with segregation? - [Earl] Well the law that was at issue required what was in theory separate but equal accommodation of African Americans and Whites on public transportation. Homer Plessy objected to it because A, the facilities weren't really equal. And he objected to it in part because he was classified as Black, but also in general because he thought that that was demeaning."
Social Studies,"Obviously, a majority of members of the Supreme Court believed that the Southern states should have at least some leeway and to establish their the system of racial segregation. - [Jamal] And so, Plessy was in league with the railroad and with the civil rights organization that recruited him to set up a case. So he agreed with the railroad to board the White area of the railway car on a car going from New Orleans to a town called Covington. And it was agreed that the railway would ask him to leave."
Social Studies,"He would refuse. And then, he would be arrested. And once he was arrested, that would enable him to challenge the law under which he was arrested under the Constitution. The railroads didn't like this law. They didn't like this law because they didn't want to be subject to fines or liability for not properly maintaining separate cars. It was really up to the conductors to make sure that separate cars were maintained. And the conductors themselves could be fined by the state for not doing so."
Social Studies,"And they could also be fined by passengers for mistakenly putting someone in the wrong car. So the railroads didn't really wanna be bothered with this kind of law. And so, this particular railroad, Eastern Railway, was willing to agree to set up a situation to challenge the law. - [Kim] So Homer Plessy, he gets on this train and he challenges the statute. I believe he sat in a Whites-only car and announced that he was African American. And then, he was arrested."
Social Studies,"So what happened next? - [Jamal] He's arrested. And then, he is eventually charged with a crime, with a violation of the statute. And there's a fine associated with violating the state law. And his lawyers bring a claim that the law violates the Federal Constitution. So initially, it goes through the state courts of Louisiana. And then eventually, they rule against Homer Plessy in favor of the law. And then, his lawyers appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So how did the court rule? - [Jamal] In the years leading up to the case, the lawyers for Homer Plessy were quite concerned about the composition of the court because they weren't sure if they could count five votes in favor of Black civil rights. Because none of the justices on the court were considered to be particularly friends of Black Americans."
Social Studies,"- [Earl] In the civil rights cases in 1883, the court had already held that Congress lacked authority to prohibit segregation in public accommodations, which meant they viewed public accommodations as something fairly private rather than a civil right, a quasi-governmental right or a quasi-public right. And that's one of the big distinctions between the majority and the dissent in both the civil rights cases and in Plessy versus Ferguson."
Social Studies,"The court ruled that in fact that so long as the state of Louisiana maintained separate but equal facilities, they could do that, that that was not prohibited by the 14th Amendment. - [Jamal] The Supreme Court in 1896 rules seven to one that the Separate Car Act is constitutional. So a state is allowed to segregate its public conveyances, including rail cars, by race. The court denies that the Separate Car Act violates the 14th Amendment to the Constitution."
Social Studies,"What the court basically says is: look, the law says the railway cars have to be equal, even if they're separate. And all the 14th Amendment requires is that basic equality in civil rights. - [Earl] John Marshall Harlan, of course, dissented from that. I think that it's important to understand what was the actual nature of Harlan's dissent rather than the way that it is actually portrayed."
Social Studies,"Harlan is famous talking about the colorblind Constitution, but in fact, what he says is: ""With respect to civil rights common to all citizens,"" I don't have the exact language before me, ""that the Constitution which required to be colorblind."" So one of the big distinctions between the majority and the dissent is that Harlan does in fact believe that the right to use public transportation counted as a civil right, and therefore, was protected against segregation by Section 1 of the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"I wanna make that point because it's pretty clear that Harlan believed, for example, that maintenance of segregated schools would be constitutional. And it's also true that Harlan voted for to say that miscegenation laws were constitutional. - [Jamal] The dissenting judge, Justice Harlan himself a former supporter of slavery, who changed his views and eventually became known as a champion of Black civil rights. So Justice Harlan, the lone dissenter, one of the only Southern judges on the court."
Social Studies,"But the others were basically Northern, both Republican and Democrat. They didn't have strong views about race. They didn't have unusually strong views about race for their time. And they maintained this distinction between social and civil rights. It's important to understand in trying to understand the context of Plessy versus Ferguson that the Supreme Court used to distinguish between what it called civil rights and what it called social rights."
Social Studies,"Civil rights were basically rights to participate in civil society, and included rights like the right to enter into contracts, the right to buy property, the right to testify in court. The court understood social rights as something very different from that, which is really the right to do all of those things in the company of people of a different race. - [Kim] That's fascinating. So what was the effect of this ruling in Plessy versus Ferguson? - [Earl] There are two ways that you could look at it."
Social Studies,"That until 1954, the effect of the ruling was to say that the state governments were allowed to segregate their citizenry on the basis of race. That's one way you could look at it. Now one of the interesting questions is how much difference it would have made given the sort of culture of the Southern states even if the court had held that it was unconstitutional for the state to formally require segregation among the races."
Social Studies,"That is, that there were a lot of informal pressures which would have pushed toward segregation even if the court had said that the statute was unconstitutional. But we'll never know that. So in other words, the question in Plessy is not whether the federal government was going to mandate segregation, but rather whether the federal government was simply going to leave the states and their citizenry to their own devices in determining whether to segregate their public transportation and some other thing."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this concept of separate but equal is I think the most important thing that comes out of Plessy versus Ferguson, and then later will be at issue in the 20th century. So was separate ever equal in theory or in practice? - [Jamal] It was very clear at the time. And Justice Harlan says so in his dissenting opinion in Plessy that the practice of separating railway cars or any number of other public accommodations by race was not designed for the comfort of Black Americans."
Social Studies,"It was designed in order to maintain their social inferiority through legal institutions. So once you no longer have the institution of slavery, there was a felt need among many in the South to maintain the system of social relations that slavery represented. And that's what Jim Crow was all about. And everyone knew that's what Jim Crow was all about. So Jim Crow was really kind of in its infancy when Plessy versus Ferguson was decided."
Social Studies,"Laws that prevented Blacks from voting through a number of literacy requirements and property requirements and good character requirements and so forth, those kinds of laws were very much in their infancy at the time Plessy versus Ferguson was decided. And so, the whole system of segregation is really revving up in the 1890s. And the court just gives it carte blanche to continue after that."
Social Studies,"And it's important to remember that as of the 1890s, the Supreme Court had not admitted to ever having reversed one of its own decisions. Whereas your Plessy case was quite clear about this. The assumption was that once the court ruled, it was going to be an awfully long time before you could get the court to reverse itself. And that's in fact what happened. So the court does not reverse Plessy versus Ferguson until Brown versus Board of Education in 1954."
Social Studies,"And so, you had an almost 60-year period in which practices of institutionalized segregation had the blessing of the Supreme Court. - [Kim] So we've learned that in Plessy versus Ferguson, the Supreme Court took a narrow view of the Equal Protection Clause, ruling that separate but equal accommodations for White and Black Americans did not violate the 14th Amendment."
Social Studies,"Earl Maltz suggests that it's difficult to tell if a different outcome in Plessy versus Ferguson would have made much difference in the actions of Southern states if there was no political will to enforce integration anyway. Jamal Greene, by contrast, reminds us that segregation was just getting started at the time of the Plessy case. And this ruling by the court legitimized Jim Crow laws that would continue to spread for nearly 60 years."
Social Studies,"To learn more about Plessy versus Ferguson, check out the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution in Khan Academy's resources on U.S. government and history.."
Social Studies,"that opened the door for desegregation and the Modern Civil Rights Movement. In Brown, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools for white and black children, which had been prevalent throughout the American South since the 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson legalized segregation, were in fact inherently unequal."
Social Studies,"The named plaintiff in this case, Oliver Brown, was the father of Linda, a third-grader who had to take a bus to a segregated elementary school that was much farther from her home than the nearby school for white children. To learn more about the Brown case, I sought out the help of two experts. Theodore Shaw is the Julius L. Chambers Distinguished Professor of Law, and Director of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina School of Law."
Social Studies,"Michael McConnell is the Richard and Frances Mallery Professor, and Director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, and a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. So Prof. Shaw, could you just kinda set the stage for us? What was the overall social and political context behind this case? - [Prof. Shaw] Well Brown was decided in the Cold War era. I think that's important for reasons that I'll come back to."
Social Studies,"But it also was decided, I guess it was 58 years after the Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that separate but equal railway cars were constitutional. Of course that extended to all walks of life in the South. And so what you had was Jim Crow segregation sustained and set in place by law. And Brown was the case that cracked the edifice of Jim Crow segregation. So, it was an enormously important case. It came after a long campaign by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to overturn Plessy."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] One thing that I think is really confusing about Plessy v. Ferguson is how it interacts with the 14th Amendment. So immediately after the Civil War, Congress passed, and the states ratified, the 14th Amendment which gives equal protection under the law to all citizens. But then Plessy v. Ferguson just a couple decades later, legalizes segregation. Can you talk a little bit more about how the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment has been interpreted in Plessy, and then later in Brown v."
Social Studies,"Board? - [Prof. McConnell] The doctrine of separate but equal was itself a departure from the prior understanding of what the 14th Amendment meant. In the immediate wake of the 14th Amendment, segregation was understood to be a violation of equal rights. The Congress of the United States passed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which prohibited mandatory segregation of among other things, railroads."
Social Studies,"Now that was struck down in 1883, I believe it was 1886, but for reasons not related to separate but equal or segregation. But it's only in the late 1880s and 1890s that states began passing Jim Crow legislation, like the law in Plessy v. Ferguson. I think Plessy very likely would've come out a different way, had it come up 25 years earlier."
Social Studies,"It's really very difficult to understand the logic of Plessy, because Plessy takes the point of view that segregation is okay because it treats everyone the same way, and the sense of inferiority or insult that comes from segregation, the court just ignored. You can read the opinion different ways, and people do and have read the opinion different ways."
Social Studies,"A portion of the opinion makes it sound as though this is kind of social science conclusion, that segregation breeds a feeling of inferiority, that has a deleterious effect on the black students' performance in school. - [Prof. Shaw] There's a famous footnote in Brown v. Board of Education, Footnote 11 in which some social scientists, and particularly Dr."
Social Studies,"Kenneth Clark, did a series of tests, the doll tests, in which they showed black and white dolls who were otherwise identical to little children, little black children, and they asked who was the good doll, who was the bad doll, who was the pretty doll, who was the ugly doll. And the black children would invariably choose the white dolls as the better dolls, and the black dolls as the inferior dolls."
Social Studies,"And then finally the bombshell question, which one looks like you? And they would stop and choose the black doll, and many times, tears would come to their eyes. And so this old notion of the inferiority that segregation imbued in black school children was important, and the Supreme Court had some very eloquent language about that. - [Prof."
Social Studies,"McConnell] Everyone knew that the only reason to have laws requiring black and white to be separate, was because of the feeling on the part of the dominant white group, that the African race was inferior. I think it was a failure of political will really, rather than a matter of constitutional or legal logic that led to that. And then it took almost 60 years before the Supreme Court would turn itself around. - [Prof. Shaw] The late A."
Social Studies,"Leon Higginbotham who sat on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia, he used to say that Plessy was wrong the day it was decided. And I believe he was right about that. If you go back and look at the rationale stated in Plessy, it didn't hold up. It's not an intellectually honest decision, and having said that, if you look at Brown, it really did not overrule Plessy on its face with respect to segregation and Jim Crow across the board."
Social Studies,"What it did was say that in the field of public education, separate but equal is unconstitutional. Separate schools cannot be equal. And what followed Brown was a series of cases in all kinds of areas in which the court sometimes without much of an opinion, cited Brown, but struck down segregation in public libraries and public accommodations, and transportation, et cetera."
Social Studies,"The case that settled the long-running boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, that catapulted Martin Luther King into the national and world stage, it was decided, it was resolved finally. The boycott was important, but it was resolved by this case that the Supreme Court decided and had cited Brown. - [Kim] And so, Thurgood Marshall and the Legal Defense Fund had kind of been chipping away at the edges of segregation, and then they turned directly to school segregation in the Brown cases."
Social Studies,"So what kind of arguments did they use to challenge the system of school segregation? - [Prof. McConnell] Thurgood Marshall and his co-council in the NAACP established a very careful strategy of one case at a time, sort of pushing the envelope of this idea that segregation is inconsistent with demands of equal protection."
Social Studies,"And the interesting thing about Brown itself, the case challenging segregation in Topeka, Kansas, you know, why Topeka, Kansas? Why was this such an excellent place to raise the challenge? And the reason is that the schools in Topeka were very substantially equal in quality. In Topeka they actually had integrated high schools and middle schools."
Social Studies,"It was only the elementary schools that were segregated, and the District Court found, and the Supreme Court did not disagree that in terms of their material advantages, the black school was essentially just as good as the white school. And that's why the NAACP wanted to go after Topeka, because then it went to the principle of the thing."
Social Studies,"You know it's one thing to attack segregation when separate but equal is really just a fiction, but when separate but equal is a reality, at least pretty close to it, as in Topeka, you have to go after the actual principle that segregation is wrong in principle and not just wrong because it tends most of the time to lead to material disadvantage. - [Prof. Shaw] Brown was actually five cases. The Brown case itself came from Topeka, Kansas."
Social Studies,"In many ways, the Supreme Court might've chosen to lead with the Brown case because it wasn't part of the South, and so in some ways it might've been viewed as taking pressure off of the South. But there were five cases altogether. There was a case out of South Carolina, a case out of Virginia, a case out of Delaware, a case out of Washington DC, and then the Topeka case. And the Brown family was actually not even the only family named Brown in the Topeka case."
Social Studies,"And the other Brown case did not have their father available as the lead voice, and they wanted a man, and so Oliver Brown was the one they chose. They stipulated that the schools were in fact equal in all respects, and of course they weren't. It was never possible to make separate but equal, equal."
Social Studies,"But they stipulated that these schools were equal, the black and the white schools, because they wanted the court to be able to, or to have to, confront the issue of whether separate but equal per se was unconstitutional. - [Kim] Interesting, so it's this place where they're hoping not to have a ruling that for example, oh the schools for black children need to be brought up to code, to be the same as white children, but they're trying to strike down the idea of segregation altogether."
Social Studies,"And indeed they rule unanimously that separate but equal facilities are inherently unequal. - [Prof. McConnell] The Supreme Court in Brown says well whatever may have been the status of education as a civil right back then, back in the 19th century, by now it surely is a civil right, and therefore there can be no discrimination with regard to it."
Social Studies,"And one other thing that changed that I think the Supreme Court doesn't refer to, but many historians think was surely in the back of their minds, has to do with foreign policy of all things, that during this time the United States in the wake of World War II was playing a very major role in opposing colonialism, opposing communism, in trying to spread the gospel of liberty around the world. And when we had segregation at home, this looked like rank hypocrisy. - [Prof. Shaw] This was the Cold War period."
Social Studies,"These soldiers came home from fighting a form of racism in Europe, Nazi Germany, you know the Holocaust. And when they came back, they came back to segregated America. And there are many stories that are painful about what their experiences were. But meanwhile the United States is having this Cold War with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union was exploiting this inconsistency in what America said it was, and what it was."
Social Studies,"And though the Supreme Court never said a word about that in the Brown cases, that was very much context for that decision. - [Kim] So what did it take for desegregation to really come about? Do you think we've achieved desegregation? - [Prof. Shaw] Yes and no. There was a long battle to implement Brown, and in fact for the most part, Brown was not implemented fully to the extent it ever was until the early 1970s when the Supreme Court decided a case called Swann v."
Social Studies,"Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education in North Carolina, and sanctioned the use of busing. - [Prof. McConnell] This does not depend upon what social scientists might think about how people do in school."
Social Studies,"This is a much more fundamental principle of equality under the law, that our law must treat black and white the same, that for the government to draw racial distinctions is fundamentally unequal, and unconstitutional, and wrong, and unjust, fundamentally so and not just as a matter of social science evidence. - [Prof."
Social Studies,"Shaw] I don't wanna sound despairing, you know, but I think if anybody looks at our public schools today, and many of our communities, and our towns, and cities, and our counties, we have to acknowledge honestly that there's still a great deal of segregation, and there are many schools that are identifiably white, or identifiably black. And now Latinos, Hispanics, large degree of segregation there also."
Social Studies,"And even voluntary desegregation efforts have been found by the Supreme Court a few years ago to be largely unconstitutional and illegal, and that's tragic. But that doesn't mean that Brown wasn't significant. I was born in the year of Brown v. Board of Education. The America that I grew up in is a very different country than the one that proceeded it. In spite of our flaws and our warts, no Brown v. Board of Education, no Civil Rights Movement, I would say."
Social Studies,"And ultimately no desegregation of our society to the extent that we've accomplished it, and we have to a great degree, and no Barack Obama. So I think Brown stands, as I said, as a dividing point in America, but we can do better. - [Kim] So we've learned that under the leadership of Thurgood Marshall, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the decision in Brown v. Board of Education struck a major blow to the system of segregation."
Social Studies,"After World War II, amidst the ideological struggle of the Cold War, the Supreme Court overturned the precedent set in Plessy v. Ferguson, and ruled that segregated education constituted a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. To learn more about Brown v. Board, visit the National Constitution Center's interactive Constitution, and Khan Academy's resources on US government and politics.."
Social Studies,"Baker versus Carr grappled with an incredibly important issue. Whether one person's vote is equal to another person's vote. That seems pretty straight forward to us now, but as we'll learn in this video, before Baker versus Carr, it wasn't always the case. To learn more, I talked with two experts. Theodore Olson is a partner at the law firm of Gibson Dunn, and served as solicitor general of the United States from 2001 to 2004."
Social Studies,"Charles is the Edward Ellen Schwarzman professor of law and the founding director of the Duke Law Center on law, race, and politics. Mr. Olson, could you kind of set the stage for us. What was the overall historical and political context that led up to the issues of Baker versus Carr. - [Olson] Well, it is a very, very important decision. Earl Warrent who was chief justice at the time the case was decided later said that it was one of the most important decisions of his tenure as chief justice."
Social Studies,"Prior to the decision in Baker versus Carr, and a couple of subsequent decisions, legislatures throughout the country were organized in a way based upon geography and other considerations rather than population. We take the phrase one person, one vote for granted now."
Social Studies,"But prior to that time, rural counties particularly, all over the United States, dominated state legislators and individuals in cities, particularly, might be electing one representative when a rural county or a rural geographical area, much smaller in terms of population, would also have the same amount of votes."
Social Studies,"So there was a disproportionate weight to smaller communities based upon population, which had very significant political consequences with respect to allocation of money and resources and the like. - [Charles] So in the US we draw lines as a way of aggregating voters together so that way we can elect people to various representative bodies. So the process of doing so, drawing the lines, is called, depending on when it's done, reapportionment or redistricting or districting."
Social Studies,"So we draw lines through districts for the purposes of representation. And that has been the practice in the US for basically time immemorial, but the way of districting for the purpose of representation. Well, many states, especially in the late 19th century to early 20th century, refused. They drew the lines, in the case of Tennessee, they drew the line in 1901."
Social Studies,"That was the last time they reapportioned where they counted the number of voters in the state and then they decided how many voters were going to be in each particular district. So a lot of time has passed from 1901 to when the case was decided in 1961, and many people moved from the rural areas to the urban areas, or from the rural areas to the suburbs, and the districts were just not equal. There weren't the same number of voters in each particular district."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this case took place originally in Tennessee and was brought by a man named Charles Baker. So who was Charles Baker and why did he object to how districting was done in Tennessee? - [Olson] Well he was among a group of citizens in a way, like many other supreme court cases, it's an accident that his name is the one by which we remember the case."
Social Studies,"So he came together, along with some lawyers and other citizens in this Tennessee area, and brought the case because of they listed the participants as plaintiffs alphabetically, Mr. Baker was the first one on the list and he became the plaintiff. There were a group of citizens in Tennessee, he was on the board of judicial body in Tennessee, but he was among several citizens who objected to the way the state legislature was apportioned. - [Instructor] Suppose that we have a class term."
Social Studies,"I'd say we have an AP history class and we're deciding I want to take the class out to dinner and we're making two decisions, a seafood place or a steak place. Let's suppose that we have 10 people in the class and we have three districts, all right. So we're gonna make it when the basis of the decision of those three districts. Okay, so we've got one district of two people who like seafood, another district of two others who like seafood, and a district of six people who like steak, all right."
Social Studies,"But we're gonna decide on the basis of the votes of each of the districts and the outcome, the majority of the votes in the district will decide the outcome. So remember the first district had two people and both of those people like seafood. Our second district also had two people, and both of those like seafood. And our third district had six people, and those six like steak."
Social Studies,"Now, on the basis of the decision of the district, right, so each district counts for one vote, seafood wins two to one, all right. But, if you look at the total number of people and the total preferences, there are actually six people who like steak and four people who like seafood. So really, the decision should be in favor of steak as the majority of the people or the voters in that classroom preferred steak over seafood."
Social Studies,"But we can rejigger that outcome by just dividing the people into districts and dividing them into unequal districts, and then saying each district gets one vote. Well, for all intents and purposes, this is exactly what Tennessee had done. They basically divided the state into districts so that way, and elect representatives from that district."
Social Studies,"But some districts only had let's say 100 people, and others had 1,000 people, and some had 400, some had 10,000, I'm making up the numbers here, but just to give you an example of what the disparities were like. But each counted essentially as one. Each district had one vote, even though they weren't equal in the number of people that were in the district. When a student comes to me and says, well, wait a minute, there are many more people who prefer steak, it's a majority."
Social Studies,"I'm not going to change the system because the system reflects my preferences and it was the same thing in Tennessee. The state legislature did not have the incentive to change the system because if they did they would lose their seats. - [Kim] So it's pretty quirky. This is of course, the supreme court is turning to the Constitution for its interpretation."
Social Studies,"So what does the Constitution say about apportioning representatives? Does it make any mention of how districts are supposed the be drawn? - [Olson] It does not. It's very interesting that our Constitution, as everyone knows, gives two senators for each state and then apportions the house of representatives by district, which is required to be redetermined every 10 years after the census."
Social Studies,"But, prior to Baker versus Carr, there was very little regard to the fact that some districts were more populous than other districts, which meant that an individual voter in a populous district, who had the same amount, had a vote, that was diluted in a sense that he shared that vote, or that weight of his vote with many more persons. And this was rampant all over the United States."
Social Studies,"In California, Los Angeles County had, which was 40 percent of the population of the state of California, had one representative because it was a county and it had lots of people in it. And then there were three smaller counties who had very, very few people, maybe had 10 or 15,000 people in the county, and they each had one vote as well."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So Charles Baker takes this case to the courts, and then what happens? How does this case make its way through the courts? - [Charles] Well, the one thing to think about, the reason why Baker versus Carr is such an important case, we have to remember that the federal courts and particulars through the United States Supreme Court had said in a case called Colegrove versus Green, look, we, the federal courts, are not going to involve ourselves in any of these redistricting type cases."
Social Studies,"We don't wanna have anything to do with them. We don't believe we have the power to hear them, so in '46, the court said we don't have the power to hear these cases and no matter what happens, those are cases that belong to the political process. Those are not cases that belong in the federal courts. And large part, an important part because we don't think the constitution has anything to say about those cases."
Social Studies,"- [Olson] So when it got to the supreme court again in Baker versus Carr, the question was whether the court would reverse that earlier decision and decide this is something that we, as a court, can deal with as opposed to something that must remain in the political realm. And the case was argued twice, in April of 1961 and again in October of 1961."
Social Studies,"The court set it for rearguement because the first time it was argued, one of the justices was undecided and they were divided four to four and they decided to set it for reargument again. And when the case was then decided after the second argument, the court ruled six to two. One of the justices became disabled at the end of the deliberation, so it was only eight rather than nine."
Social Studies,"But they decided six to two the narrow, relatively narrow question, not one person one vote, but the narrow question is this something that the Constitution gives us permission to decide."
Social Studies,"And reciting the 14th amendment to the Constitution which contains the well known due process and equal protection clause, the court and Baker versus Carr decided we can look at the Constitution to discern from the equal protection clause that there is, and due process clause, but mostly the equal protection clause, there is a basis for us to decide that it might violate an individuals constitutional right to equal protection of the laws."
Social Studies,"If they're placed in a political situation where their vote counts less than someone else's vote. - [Charles] And so that's the way that the court got around that question. And the technical legal term is to say that these cases are justiciable, which means that the courts can hear them, that the federal courts have the power to decide these types of cases. Now, the court did not decide the second question in Baker versus Carr, which is okay."
Social Studies,"Suppose that it's true, right, which if the court says it's so, it is now true, that federal courts do have the power to make those decisions, how do we determine what is the standard that we're going to use to determine whether the constitution is violated? And that question the court put off to the side. The court said something to the effect that look, we know that there are standards, they are available."
Social Studies,"What we're deciding now is that we have the power because the equal protection clause, in fact, means that the state can't draw lines that are so malapportioned that they undermine the equality of voters. - [Kim] Baker versus Carr says that the courts then can rule on redistricting. Did this bring in a flood of cases about redistricting? - [Olson] It did."
Social Studies,"Once the court decided that this was fair game, that this was appropriate for courts to consider whether or not disparities in voting power as a result of packing people into different districts in different ways constituted a violation of the Constitution, then in a relatively short term by supreme court standards in 1963 and 1964 and other decisions that all came about before the end of the '60's."
Social Studies,"The court pronounced in case after case that one person, one vote did indeed have to, was required by the Constitution. So, Baker versus Carr opened the door for a stream of decisions from the supreme court that put into our constitutional fabric the concept of one person one vote. Which changed probably more than anything, the structure of our political government in the United States."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Do you think that our election system today conforms to this standard of one person one vote? - [Olson] Well, we probably haven't solved all of the problems, but compared to where we were in 1961 before Baker versus Carr, we've really crossed that rubicon. Most districts are relatively equal. There is a census every 10 years so that we can count the number of persons in districts."
Social Studies,"There's still cases that come along, there are cases involving the allocation of persons by race and whether there are systems in place that discriminate on the basis of race. - [Charles] Some states have passed laws requiring voters to present photo identification when the voter goes to vote at the polling place. And one objection to the photo ID is that it's a violation of the equal protection clause."
Social Studies,"It's a violation of the idea of of equality that voters are not being treated equally via 71 and other because some voters have voter ID's and others have a hard time getting them for whatever reason. And there are some, there might be racial disproportionate effects, might be class effects, there might be gender effects."
Social Studies,"So this raises a violation of the equal protection clause and these are the types of arguments that are now available to someone challenging the problem of inequality in voting pose after Baker v. Carr that were not available before that Baker versus Carr. And to fully answer your question, some people might be say look, we don't fully have one person one vote because we have a lot of laws that treat voters unequally."
Social Studies,"- [Olson] If the political party A, controls both houses of a legislature in a particular state and the person who's in the governors mansion, then those lines can be drawn to favor that political party. So that you might have situations where a political party maybe only has 40 percent of the registered voters in a particular state, but maybe 55 percent of the elected representatives. That's called political gerrymandering. And those issues have come before the court."
Social Studies,"- [Charles] We still haven't achieved the type of equality that was promised by the Baker line of cases. - [Kim] So we've learned that in Baker versus Carr the supreme court ruled that redistricting was a justiciable issue, or something that the federal courts could decide because ensuring that votes have equal weight is important to ensuring equal protection under the law."
Social Studies,"The standard of one person, one vote opened the flood gate for cases about equality of representation in districting which are still being litigated at the supreme court today.

Social Studies,"To learn more about the case, I spoke with two experts. Jeffrey Rosen is the president and CEO of the National Constitution Center who's written extensively about the Supreme Court. Paul Cassell is the Ronald N. Boyce Presidential Professor of Criminal Law at The University of Utah School of Law. He's a leading researcher on criminal procedure and crime victims rights."
Social Studies,"So Jeff, if we actually go back to the time of this case what was going on at this time in constitutional law, why was the Miranda case so important? - [Jeff] The Miranda case was hugely important because it represented the high water mark of the Warren Court's criminal procedure revolution. The 1960's were a time when there was a lot of concern about the third degree."
Social Studies,Southern states were interrogating African American defendants in ways that struck many people as unfair but the Supreme Court took a long time to respond.
Social Studies,"- [Paul] Historically the admissibility of confessions into a trial had been determined by what is called, The Voluntariness Test and that required a judge to decide was the confession voluntarily given or had the police used unfair, overly aggressive tactics to extract it but making those kinds of determinations had proven challenging for some courts and so there was interest in coming up with, I guess what you might call a bright-line rule, a single test for determining whether confessions were or were not voluntary."
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] The court didn't really settle on a standard for deciding whether or not a confession was voluntary or not. A test emerged and it was called, the Totality of The Circumstances Test which basically gave judges a lot of discretion to weigh different factors."
Social Studies,"Was the defendant well educated, what was his physical health, his emotional characteristics but lots of people were uncomfortable with the amorphousness of this test and at a time when there's renewed concern in the 1960's about the unfairness of the third degree, there's pressure to come up with a crisper and more constitutionally rooted way ensuring that confessions are not only involuntary in the sense of not being beaten out of the suspect but not involuntary in the sense of not reflecting the subtle coercive pressures of the confession room."
Social Studies,- [Paul] So Miranda was arrested on suspicion of rape and at the time the law on confessions was somewhat in flux. He appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court and then ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court which agreed to review his case and determine the issue. - [Kim] So who was Ernesto Miranda? What was his background? - [Jeff] Ernesto Miranda was a 23 year old Hispanic man. He was accused of raping a woman called Patricia.
Social Studies,"That was a pseudonym for her real name, she was basically forced into a car after getting off of a bus and assaulted in this terrible way. - [Paul] Miranda was a laborer, he was poorly educated I think is fair to say and I think it's also important to remember that he was a rapist. There doesn't seem to be any doubt that he in fact had sexually assaulted a young 18 year old girl as she was walking home from work late one night."
Social Studies,"He grabbed her off the street, threw her into the back of his car and drove her out into the desert and raped her and so those are all things that I think are important to recall when we talk about the Miranda decision. - [Jeff] And he was identified after a friend of hers saw a car similar to the one that she described a week later and the police tracked the registration down to Miranda's girlfriend who identified him."
Social Studies,"- [Paul] So the police got the report of the crime from the victim and they also had report of an unusual car that was involved and so eventually they were able to identify a car that was similar to that described by the victim that came back as registered to Miranda and so they picked him up for questioning, they took him into the station house. He denied having any involvement but then the police pulled a ploy, they had the victim come and look at Miranda along with a couple of other people in a lineup."
Social Studies,"A group of similarly appearing people and the victim thought that maybe Miranda was the person who'd committed the crime but she wasn't sure. So the police went back to Miranda and they said, ""Well, she's identified you."" and Miranda at that point said, ""Well I guess I better tell you what happened then."" and he made a confession to the rape as well as to some other crimes as well. - [Jeff] The question was whether this confession was consistent with the Fifth Amendment."
Social Studies,"He might or might not have met the totality of the circumstances test as Justice Harlan noted in his dissent. Miranda was 23 years old, indigent, educated to the extent of completing half the ninth grade, had an emotional illness of the schizophrenic type and the question was whether he made a knowing and intelligent waiver of these rights but the Supreme Court decided not to stick to that old totality of the circumstances test and rethink the entire way that confessions should be evaluated."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So the Supreme Court was kind of looking for an example case right, to try to figure out what this line should be about confessions and how the police should treat suspects."
Social Studies,Why did they choose this case in particular? - [Jeff] The court chose the Miranda case 'cause it came up at the right time at a time when all of the judges were increasingly impatient with this totality of the circumstances test including the great liberal textualist Hugo Black who had been a opponent of the voluntariness test 'cause he just thought it was too subjective. So they took the case.
Social Studies,It was certainly not a sympathetic one in the sense that Miranda was not the most sympathetic defendant but the court thought the time was right and they decided in Miranda to rethink the Fifth Amendment law.
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Wow, so during his case what did Miranda argue? So why did he think that his confession should be thrown out? - [Paul] Well Miranda's case attracted a lot of attention because everyone knew the Supreme Court were very interested in the law of confessions and trying to come up with a new rule for addressing some of the issues and so he had a very good lawyer, John Flynn. Flynn interestingly enough argued that Miranda's right to counsel had been violated."
Social Studies,"It was only the police and Miranda who were in the interview room talking to each other and there was no lawyer there and so Flynn argued that this violated Miranda's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. However as the case developed and ultimately the opinion was released, the Supreme Court rejected the Sixth Amendment argument and instead went with the Fifth Amendment argument."
Social Studies,The court said that what had been violated by the procedures here was Miranda's right against being compelled to incriminate himself and the court said that there needed to be certain warnings given to Miranda and certain procedures followed to make sure that confessions given by suspects like him were admissible in court.
Social Studies,"- [Jeff] Flynn never said the confession was compelled in the sense that it was coerced by threats or promises or compulsion or at gunpoint but the fact that he gave the confession without knowing his rights, to silence or having an attorney present while in police custody made him in effect surrender a right that he didn't fully realize and appreciate."
Social Studies,"The State was represented by very prominent attorney Telford Taylor and he said that you should retain the totality of the circumstances test and not change the law but the Supreme Court disagreed and on June 13th 1966, it announced its five to four decision in the Miranda case. - [Kim] So what actually happened to Ernesto Miranda after this Supreme Court case? - [Jeff] Well the fallout from the decision was interesting."
Social Studies,"Miranda assumed that he was going to be released because the Supreme Court had ruled his confession inadmissible and that was a pivotal piece of evidence without which the prosecution was not going to be able to prove that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and so Miranda's father ordered a bottle of whisky that they were going to open to celebrate his release. But unfortunately for Miranda and I suspect fortunately for the citizens of Phoenix, Miranda had made a few statements along the way."
Social Studies,"He had threatened his common-law wife that he was going to get out and was going to come back and try to take the kids away from her and she went to police and reported that Miranda had confessed the crime to her and of course a confession to a private citizen, a common-law wife is not the same thing as a confession to a police officer and so the case was retried. Miranda's confession to his common-law wife was used in evidence against him."
Social Studies,"Miranda was convicted and I guess it's fair to say that bottle of whisky went unopened. - [Kim] Alright this is very interesting because we see this a lot on TV procedurals and also just in our sort of everyday policing. So how is this Miranda rule applied today? Has it developed at all over time? - [Paul] Yes, what the Supreme Court said was basically two things were going to have to happen before a confession given by someone who was in police custody could be admitted at a trial."
Social Studies,"The first is that the suspect would have to be given Miranda warnings. That is, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you. You have a right to an attorney before you answer any questions and if you cannot afford an attorney one will provided for you."
Social Studies,So those are the famous Miranda warnings that I think a lot of have seen those on TV shows or other programs and there is a second feature though of Miranda that I think is much more important and in some ways much more harmful to society. It's what is known as the waiver requirement.
Social Studies,"Police officers must ask a suspect, ""Do you agree to answer questions?"" and if the suspect says no then the police can't ask that suspect any questions no matter how briefly, no matter how reasonable the questions might be and so it's this warning and waiver procedure that the Supreme Court put in place. - [Jeff] So that core right remains the law of the land. - [Paul] So there are some situations where Miranda is not in place. One of them is if a suspect is not in custody."
Social Studies,For example if the police are responding to a crime and question people on the scene there. That's not a situation where there is what's known in the Miranda opinion as the inherent compulsion of police questioning. That's just ordinary citizen police interaction and special warnings aren't required there.
Social Studies,"Also a suspect's agreed to come down to the police station and talk, there's no requirement of a Miranda warning and in very rare situations, if there is an extremely pressing public safety need police officers need not give Miranda warnings. For example if they've apprehended a terrorist who's hidden a bomb, police can ask questions without giving the Miranda warnings."
Social Studies,- [Kim] How has the Miranda case and later cases that interpret Miranda reflect the way that the court balances individual liberty and the constitutional rights of defendants with public safety and the needs of law enforcement? - [Paul] When the Supreme Court looked at the Miranda case there were two competing concerns at play.
Social Studies,"One was to make sure that suspects like Miranda were treated fairly but the other was to make sure that law enforcement agencies could effectively investigate crime and what resulted out of Miranda was I think it's fair to say, something of a compromised decision. There were some who argued that police officers should never be able to question suspects once they were taken into custody that suspects should receive a lawyer and of course a lawyer would immediately tell a suspect, don't say anything at all."
Social Studies,Miranda didn't go that far and I think the reason it didn't go that far is there are very significant countervailing concerns. A lot of crimes cannot be solved unless a suspect is willing to give some statements and provide information that police can check out. The Miranda case itself is a good illustration of that.
Social Studies,"The victim in that case, because the crime was committed at nighttime and in the dark was unable to give a positive identification of Miranda and it was only when police were able to get a statement from him that they were in a position to move forward and prosecute him and to take a dangerous rapist off the streets of Phoenix, Arizona."
Social Studies,- [Jeff] Listeners should definitely check out Professor Cassell's study written with Richard Fowles in 1998 called Handcuffing The Cops which looked at FBI data for crime clearance rates in the two years after Miranda which fell significantly and they concluded that Miranda warnings were the main cause of this decline.
Social Studies,"But it's really important to stress that other scholars have questioned the study and have also noted that even if Miranda initially made it more difficult for officials to interrogate suspects, the police have since adjusted to Miranda."
Social Studies,"In fact they've come often to embrace it concluding that basically saying the magic words and mirandizing suspects frees up the police to employ a range of sophisticated strategies to get people to confess anyway and for this reason when the Miranda case was reaffirmed, far from being upset, the police in many cases welcomed the certainty that Miranda provides."
Social Studies,"So for all these reasons I think it's fair to say, just descriptively that Miranda regardless of the empirical dispute about whether or not it has discouraged confessions has been accepted by law enforcement by and large. It's been affirmed by the Supreme Court and at least for the immediate future, it's here to stay."
Social Studies,- [Kim] So we've learned that the ruling in Miranda versus Arizona arose out of concern that suspects in police custody might confess out of coercion or lack of knowledge about their own rights. The decision in Miranda that suspects must be informed of their rights helps to protect individuals accused of a crime from surrendering their Fifth Amendment right not to self incriminate.
Social Studies,But has Miranda harmed the ability of police to investigate crimes by preventing them from obtaining important information? Professor Cassell suggests that the broad application of Miranda has hampered police investigations. By contrast Jeff Rosen argues that police have adjusted to working within the confines of Miranda and use other techniques to investigate crime.

Social Studies,"Clarke Forsythe is Senior Counsel for Americans United for Life and the author of Abuse of Discretion: The Inside Story of Roe V. Wade. Melissa Murray is the Alexander F. and May T. Morrison Professor of Law at Berkeley Law School, where she also serves as the Faculty Director for the Center for Reproductive Rights and Justice. Mr. Forsythe, could you set the stage for us a little bit."
Social Studies,"What was going on at this time period? - [Clarke] Well, there were efforts in the 1960s to repeal abortion laws in the states and when abortion activists were dissatisfied with those efforts, they decided to go into the courts. And around 1969, they took some cases into the courts and ultimately, there were 20 or more cases challenging state laws in the courts between 1969 and 1973 and Roe versus Wade was the case from Texas. - [Melissa] Roe was litigated in the early 1970s."
Social Studies,"It was a period of enormous change in the United States. We were beginning to see beginnings of the women's rights movements, the beginning of the gay rights movement, and of course, the civil rights movement of the 1960s was moving in a lot of different directions. At the time, the question of abortion was very much on the minds of lots of different state legislatures because there had been moves to liberalize much of the criminal law that dealt with matters of sex and sexuality, including abortion."
Social Studies,"At the time, four states, New York, Alaska, Hawaii, and I believe Washington, had actually taken steps to repeal their laws criminalizing abortion. And about 13 other states had taken efforts to liberalize their laws criminalizing abortions, but in number of other states, around, at least 20 or more, there remained on the books, laws that absolutely criminalized abortion, except in situations where it would be necessary to preserve the woman's health or life, or in cases of rape, incest, or fetal anomaly."
Social Studies,"- [Clarke] Abortion rights attorneys sought plaintiffs who could challenge the Texas law and the Georgia law. There were two attorneys from Texas who found Norma McCorvey, who they gave the pseudonym of Jane Roe, for purposes of protecting her privacy. And she became the nominal plaintiff. - [Melissa] And so Norma McCorvey brought this case. She was a 22 year old woman living in Dallas County, Texas, who found herself pregnant for the third time."
Social Studies,"She was unmarried, her first child had been born, a daughter, and she had ultimately signed over custody of her daughter to her mother to raise, because she was having a bit of itinerant life, was unable to take care of her child. The second child that she bore, she gave up for adoption. And so when she found herself pregnant for a third time, she wasn't willing to do either of these things again and wanted to safely and legally terminate her pregnancy. But this was impossible under the Texas law."
Social Studies,"Texas had, since the 19th century absolutely criminalized abortion except in cases where it was necessary for the health and safety of the mother. And so she then was faced with the question of what was she going to do. And the only thing she could think to do then, was to actually challenge the law. So she was put in contact with Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, two young women who had recently graduated from law school."
Social Studies,"Sarah Weddington was only 26 years old at the time she helped Norma McCorvey bring this case. But they decided to sue the State of Texas to challenge the constitutionality of Texas' criminal abortion ban. - [Clarke] But as the history shows, there was no trial, there was no evidence, there were no expert witnesses. Jane Roe never testified. As you know, she never got an abortion. She gave birth and placed her child for adoption."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Okay, so Roe was Norma McCorvey, who was Wade? - [Clarke] Henry Wade was the District Attorney for Dallas, Texas, where the case was filed in Federal District Court."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So this case, I assume kind of wends it's way through the courts and how did the Supreme Court rule? - [Clarke] The Justices declared the Texas and Georgia laws unconstitutional and then rewrote a national law, a national abortion law, in which they said that the states could not regulate or limit abortion in the first trimester."
Social Studies,"They could regulate more in the second trimester, the second three months of pregnancy, to protect maternal health and they could regulate in the last three months of pregnancy, the last trimester, to protect maternal health or fetal life."
Social Studies,"The attorneys for the plaintiffs claimed that abortion fell within the right to privacy, even though privacy is not in the text of the Constitution, they said it was derived, or based in the language of the 14th amendment of the Constitution even though the 14th amendment doesn't say anything about abortion, or the unborn child, it just uses the term liberty. And ultimately the Court said that the right to abortion is part of the right to privacy based on the 14th amendment."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] That's very interesting. So I've learned through many of these interviews, that this right to privacy is something that is never actually explicitly stated throughout the Bill of Rights, but there's a penumbra of privacy that you see in a few ways."
Social Studies,"What was the Court's reasoning that it was abortion that could fall under this zone of privacy? - [Clarke] If you read the Roe opinion, on page 152 of the Roe opinion, Justice Blackmun starts out by saying that, he cites a string of cases since about 1910, a string of Supreme Court cases and says that these lead to the right of privacy and we think abortion, or that the right of privacy is broad enough to encompass abortion."
Social Studies,"But then four pages later, on page 156, Blackmun turns around and says, but abortion because it involves the taking of a life, is inherently different from all those other cases that make up the right of privacy. - [Melissa] So the right of privacy doesn't actually come from Roe versus Wade, it comes from a case decided about eight years earlier, in 1965 called, Griswold versus Connecticut."
Social Studies,"In Griswold, at issue was a Connecticut state statute that made it a crime to use contraception or even to counsel patients about contraception. Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut opened up a birth control clinic in New Haven, Connecticut. They were promptly arrested and the clinic was closed and then they were able to bring this case. And they argued that the right to be able to use contraception was the right of the individual."
Social Studies,"The right of the doctor to advise patients about contraception was also an individual right. And the Court, in an opinion authored by William O. Douglas agrees with them. And the Court articulates for the first time this right of privacy and this is a right that the majority in Griswold says is actually been percolating in the Court's decisions for some time."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Did any of the Justices dissent in the Roe decision and if so, why? - [Clarke] Well there were two dissents by Justice White and by Justice Rehnquist and Justice White said that the Court was engaging in raw judicial power and that the Justices did not have the right or the authority to strike down the abortion laws of the States and could not rely upon a doctrine called, substantive due process."
Social Studies,"Justice Rehnquist said that there is clear historical evidence that many states passed abortion limits and prohibitions precisely at the time of the framing of the 14th amendment in the 1860s leading up to 1868 and that the evidentiary history, this history of state limits and prohibitions on abortion contradicted any proposition that the 14th amendment was intended to include a right to abortion and that was kind of the heart of his dissent."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So Roe was not the last word on abortion in the United States. There have been several later cases that were important to this as well, like Planned Parenthood versus Casey, or Whole Woman's Health versus Hellerstedt. Can you talk a little bit about how those cases have altered the scope of the right to abortion? - [Melissa] As soon as Roe is decided in 1973, there is an effort to sort of roll it back and hem it in a little bit."
Social Studies,"Frank Church, who's a Senator from Idaho, announces the Church amendment, which basically says that physicians don't have to perform abortions if doing so would conflict with their conscience or conscientious beliefs. So, again, that's one opportunity to sort of limit the reach of this right, by limiting the number of providers who are available to offer abortions. - [Clarke] In fact the Court has kind of cut back on Roe versus Wade in four cases over the years."
Social Studies,"Harris versus McRae involving abortion funding. Planned Parenthood versus Casey and in other cases, they've given more deference to the states, allowed the states to pass more and more limits at least around the margins, even though they've continued holding to the basic right that Roe created, that there was a right to abortion for virtually any reason, at any time of pregnancy."
Social Studies,"That's still the scope of the right, but they've allowed marginal regulations, like limits on public funding, parental notice and consent, informed consent laws. But then the Court flip flopped in 2016, in June of 2016 in Whole Woman's Health versus Hellerstedt. - [Melissa] The case makes its way to the Supreme Court and in an opinion that's authored by Justice Stephen Breyer and it's only an eight person Court because Justice Scalia passes away in February of 2016, so just eight people on the Court."
Social Studies,"In this decision, it's a five to three decision, Justice Stephen Breyer notes that the provisions that were challenged do not offer the medical benefits that they claimed to offer, sufficient to justify the burdens on access that each of those provisions imposes. - [Kim] What do you see as the future of Roe versus Wade? - [Clarke] Well, the Court has failed as the national abortion control board. It can not monitor abortion."
Social Studies,"It can't intervene, it can't regulate or legislate itself, it can't act as public health administrators It can't investigate and I believe it's absolutely certain that the Court, sooner or later, will have to overturn the Roe versus Wade decision because of this failure and return the issue to the states."
Social Studies,"- [Melissa] When we are talking about repealing or reforming these laws in the 1960s and 70s, it's also around a social movement where one of the critical questions is, what will be the role of women going forth in a modern society. When the questions of contraception come before the Court, one of the questions is whether women will be allowed to choose when and how to have children, whether they can space the timing of births to accommodate careers."
Social Studies,"It's the same issue that comes up in abortion, like this allowing women freedom to be able to go into the workforce, to determine when and how they will become mothers. And so, it's not surprising that the same questions that arose in 19th century about the place of women, about what happens in a society that's undergoing change, whether its immigration or changes in the demography of the country, are also coming up in the 1960s and 1970s at a time of incredible social change."
Social Studies,"And I think abortion and these rights involving a woman's role really do come to the fore and are incredibly controversial. - [Kim] So we've learned that the decision to legalize abortion in Roe versus Wade was based on the right of privacy, which the court has inferred from the due process clause of the 14th amendment. Since the Roe decision, a number of other cases have set limits on abortion and abortion clinics."
Social Studies,"Clarke Forsythe argues that the Supreme Court has failed in regulating abortion and that the issue should be returned to the states. Melissa Murray, by contrast, suggests that the decision in Roe is crucial to giving women the freedom to join the workforce and make decisions about when to have children.

Social Studies,"Elizabeth Wydra is a Supreme Court litigator and the president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. So, Miss Wydra, could you set the stage for us? Who were the challengers in this case and why did they decide to sue? - [Elizabeth] The lead plaintiff is or was Otis McDonald, then 76 year old African American retired maintenance engineer who lived in a part of Chicago and wanted to have a gun for self defense, a handgun, to protect himself and his family in his home."
Social Studies,He lived in a neighborhood that had grown increasingly troubled with gang and drug related violence and he felt that he wanted to have a handgun to protect his wife and his family after his home had been broken into several times.
Social Studies,"But because the city of Chicago had strict rules barring handguns, he and three other Chicago residents brought their case into court asking the court to find that the individual right to keep and bear arms, including a handgun for self defense in the home that had been recognized just a few years earlier by the Supreme Court with respect to the federal government, also applies to the states and cities like Chicago."
Social Studies,"- [Alan] In 2008, the Supreme Court had held that the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution guarantees Americans the right to have guns for the purpose of self defense, but that case took place in Washington D.C., and Washington D.C. is sort of a unique creature in our law."
Social Studies,"It's a federal city, it's not located in any particular state, and so everything that the city of Washington does is essentially done by the federal government or a unit of the federal government to which the Bill of Rights applies directly, but historically, the Bill of Rights was never thought to apply directly to limit what cities and states could do."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So what were some of competing interpretations that were at issue in this case? - [Alan] Well, there were a number of interpretations that were at issue. The 14th Amendment has several parts to it."
Social Studies,"In the first section of the 14th Amendment, it states that, ""no state shall make or enforce ""any law which shall abridge the privileges ""or immunities of citizens of the United States."" And then it also says, among other things, that ""states can't deprive people of due process ""when it comes time to regulating their life, liberty, ""or property."" States may not deprive anyone of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."
Social Studies,"When it comes to your basic civil rights, the question had always been whether or not the states are bound not to violate your civil rights because they are told not to abridge the privileges or immunities of American citizens or are your rights not to be violated because the states can't deprive you of due process of law."
Social Studies,"- [Elizabeth] So when the drafters of the 14th Amendment were coming together to think about what rights would be protected in the 14th Amendment, they looked at a lot of the abuses by state governments of key rights that had been previously protected against federal government action in the Bill of Rights. And when they were debating what rights would be included in these protections against state action, they talked repeatedly about the importance of the right to keep and bear arms."
Social Studies,"But the way they talked about it was very different from the way that we think about the 18th century revolutionary founders talking about the right to keep and bear arms. In that case, it was very much about the militia and preventing the tyranny of government action. In the 14th Amendment context, the right to keep and bear arms was very much an individual right."
Social Studies,"They were concerned about freed persons being subject to white militia violence and being able to protect themselves with a gun in their house, and so that was really one of the ways in which they wanted to protect the individual right to keep and bear arms, different from the way that I think the founders thought about it when they were drafting the 2nd Amendment."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] Yeah, this is a really interesting point because you can kind of see how these things evolve over time and particularly in the 1860s after the Civil War, there are many local or state statutes known as the Black Codes that specifically prevented newly free African Americans from owning firearms or any kind of weapon."
Social Studies,"- [Elizabeth] Exactly, and that was a concern because, one, it was a right that they considered to be a right of citizenship, but two, and more practically and more immediately of concern for the people who were being targeted by this racial violence, it was something that was a question of life or death for them, and the debates on this by the drafters of the 14th Amendment were very clear and very colorful."
Social Studies,"Senator Samuel Pomeroy described how indispensable the right to keep and bear arms was and how important it was that the 14th Amendment protect that right. He said during the debates, ""every man should have ""the right to bear arms for the defense of himself, ""and family, and his homestead."
Social Studies,"""And if the cabin door of the freedman is broken open, ""and the intruder enters for purposes as vile ""as were known to slavery, then should a well-loaded musket ""be in the hand of the occupant, to send the polluted wretch ""to another world, where his wretchedness ""will forever remain complete."" - [Kim] So going back to the McDonald case, how did the court rule in this case? - [Alan] In McDonald, we made two arguments for why we should win."
Social Studies,"The first argument we made was the historically more obvious one, although it's one that the courts had not often entertained, and that's the argument that says that when the 14th Amendment provided that the people cannot be deprived of the privileges or immunities of American citizenship. That means they couldn't be deprived of their basic fundamental rights. Right there in the text of the 14th Amendment it tells you that you can't be deprived of the rights of American citizenship."
Social Studies,"Secondly, we made the argument that, and this is the argument that the courts have been more open to over the years, we made the argument that where the state is prohibited from depriving Otis McDonald and other Chicago residents of due process of law, and you can't deprive someone of due process."
Social Studies,"That means not just that the state can do things arbitrarily, not just that Otis McDonald is entitled to some procedural protections in the way that he's regulated, but also that there's some results, some things that simply cannot be done, and taking away someone's firearms in violation of the 2nd Amendment rights is not something that the state can do. There's no procedure that the state could create to achieve that. They would still be considered to be giving somebody due process of law."
Social Studies,"- [Elizabeth] So the court said what we have done when we've looked at individual rights under the 14th Amendment, and whether or not original Bill of Rights rights that were initially understood to limit the federal government applied to the states, is look at whether or not they are part of what we generally talk about as fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, or stated another way, the question is whether the right is firmly rooted in this nation's history and tradition, and when they looked at that question with respect to the right to keep and bear arms, they looked at a lot of the Reconstruction history and said this was clearly something that the drafters of the 14th Amendment considered to be very fundamental to ordered liberty and thought that, indeed, the freedmen, the African American people of the South who had been subject to the slave power and people across the country who'd been subject to discrimination from the states should be able to look to the Constitution to protect the right to keep and bear arms as their individual right, just as the court had held in the Heller case, they could be able to look to the Constitution for protection of that right against the federal government."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So in the McDonald case, how did the majority of the court rule? - [Alan] The justices broke down in multiple different ways. There were four justices, led by Justice Alito, who refused to look any further at the privileges or immunities clause. They thought it was old, it was water under the bridge."
Social Studies,"They were not interested in looking to see whether or not the courts erasing of that provision was legitimate, even it's widely agreed to be illegitimate today, but the court didn't wanna go there, and instead those four justices, led by Justice Alito, held that the due process clause incorporates the 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms as against the states because it is a fundamental right. It's deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions."
Social Studies,"It's something that's very basic to our understanding of our civil and political institutions. The four justices thought the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental. - [Elizabeth] There was actually a debate among the members of the majority who all believe that there was a right to have a handgun in the house for self defense that was protected against state and local government regulations, but Justice Thomas would have found that right through another means."
Social Studies,"He would have looked at the privileges or immunities clause of the 14th Amendment, instead of the now accepted method of looking at due process liberty clause of the 14th Amendment, which is how these other provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated against the states."
Social Studies,"There were many arguments, including, I should say, a brief that I filed on behalf of scholars from across the ideological spectrum who said that, in fact, the privileges or immunities clause of the 14th Amendment is the part of that constitutional amendment that was intended to protect this particular substantive right as well as the other substantive rights of the Bill of Rights against state infringement, just as Thomas' concurrence did not get any of the other votes, whether from the people who were against the right to keep and bear arms or those who didn't, but it is an important contribution to thinking about how we understand rights and where they are protected in the Constitution."
Social Studies,"- [Alan] Justice Thomas' opinion in McDonald is groundbreaking. It represents the first time since 1868 that the original meaning of the 14th Amendment's privileges or immunities clause, the basic protection that we have for civil rights in this country against state and local governments was decisive in a case at the Supreme Court. It's been that long since a true original understanding of the 14th Amendment's language has finally proven to be decisive."
Social Studies,"- [Elizabeth] There were, of course, justices who thought that there is not an individual right to have a handgun in the home for self defense. These were the same justices, not surprisingly, who thought there wasn't a 2nd Amendment right to be protected against federal government action to keep a handgun in the home for self defense."
Social Studies,"They would've thought that this was much more a right in the 2nd Amendment context that had to do with militia service, military service, and therefore did not extend to an individual right to have a gun in the home for self defense. - [Alan] McDonald's really a 14th Amendment case. I mean, guns happen to be the thing that was in it, but I'd always seen as primarily is a 14th Amendment case. It's not really a case that tells you anything about the scope of the 2nd Amendment."
Social Studies,"In fact, it doesn't say anything about the scope of the 2nd Amendment, very little. - [Elizabeth] There are many issues left to be resolved in the 2nd Amendment context. The Heller case itself, which first articulated that there was a right for individuals to keep and bear arms in their homes for self defense made clear that it wasn't saying that there could be no gun regulation."
Social Studies,"That case, even though it was written by Justice Scolia, and certainly in the McDonald case, Justice Alito's majority opinion reiterated this, said that while there were certain laws that would be struck down as unconstitutional because they prohibited the possession of handguns in the home, they recognized at the same time that the right to keep and bear arms is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever, and for whatever purpose, so given that the court itself, and even very conservative justices recognize that there could be and perhaps should be common sense limitations on both the types of guns that are allowed, the manner in which they are allowed, and where they can be taken and in what manner, then a lot of the gun regulations that are being passed are still very much a part of the constitutional debate."
Social Studies,"We've seen, frankly, most of the laws, thus far, be upheld as constitutional laws, that, for example, target assault weapons, high capacity magazines, and certain licensing and registration requirements. So I think we will see more cases to define the contours of the individual right to keep and bear arms as these gun regulations get passed and as the courts get to pass upon their constitutionality."
Social Studies,"- [Kim] So we've learned that the Supreme Court ruled that the 14th Amendment's due process clause that no state can deprive a citizen of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, did incorporate the 2nd Amendment into the states under the reasoning that the right to keep and bear arms for self defense is fundamental to the nation's scheme of ordered liberty."
Social Studies,"According to Alan Gura, even though this case was about guns, it was really a 14th Amendment case concerning whether states can restrict citizens' liberty. Elizabeth Wydra, however, cautions that the decision in McDonald didn't preclude any restriction on gun ownership and she suspects that new cases will continue to define the individual right to keep and bear arms."

Social Studies,"So, we're here to talk about what seems like a very important Supreme Court case, Citizens United versus Federal Election Commission in 2010."
Social Studies,"Could you give a little bit of background on what got us to this Supreme Court decision? - [Rick] Well, the federal government, specifically Congress, gets to pass laws that regulate the financing of federal elections, and then, for state and local elections, that would be an issue for each state, and so, Congress, going back more than a century, has passed laws limiting the amount of money, kinds of money that can be raised, what has to be disclosed, they passed a whole bunch of laws, and these laws are sometimes challenged as being unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"The usual challenge is that the law violates part of the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and association, and the specific issue in the Citizens United case had to do with the First Amendment rights of corporations to spend money to support or oppose candidates for federal office. - [Bradley] Well, it is an important case, but it is a widely misunderstood case. The case, for example, is not about the question of whether, quote, corporations are people. We sometimes hear that."
Social Studies,"Not a single justice on the court, in any of the opinions, addresses that issue, because it's a longstanding doctrine of corporate personhood that corporations have certain rights that people have when they join together to associate. The case is not about the question of whether money equals speech. The court has long held, not that money is speech, but that you can't try to limit an activity which would be protected under the Constitution, like speech, by limiting money."
Social Studies,"For example, you could not say it shall be illegal to spend any money in the United States to publish a book or to pay an author or to operate a bookstore, right? - [Rick] So, if you were, say, General Motors or Google, and you wanted to put an ad online or on TV or in a newspaper that says support President Smith for reelection, that would be illegal if it was paid for with money from the corporation."
Social Studies,"Corporations could still participate, but they'd have to set up a separate committee, called a political action committee or a PAC, and they could only solicit certain people to put money into that pack, and they couldn't take money that they made from selling cars or software or something like that and use it for political purposes, and in Citizens United, reversing some earlier cases, the Supreme Court said that corporations, like individuals, have a First Amendment right to spend, independently, supporting or opposing candidates for office, and that it would be unconstitutional to limit this because it would be too much of an infringement on the speech rights of corporations."
Social Studies,"- [Bradley] It's about what rights people have to engage in speech when they have chosen to organize as a corporation, so the court makes the holding that corporations and unions have constitutional protection under the First Amendment when they make independent expenditures to advocate for the election or defeat of candidates, and by independent expenditures, we don't say that they can contribute money directly to candidate campaigns, but they are free to spend their own money to communicate with the public at large, and say we think you should vote for this candidate or against this candidate for these reasons, and that, I think, in a nutshell, is what the case is about at that highest level."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So, just to get a little bit more into the case, it's really all around this Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, the McCain-Feingold Act of 2002. What was all that about, and then how did that lead, eventually, to this Supreme Court decision of Citizens United versus Federal Election Commission? - [Bradley] Well, in some ways, it goes back much further than the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act."
Social Studies,"We should note that Congress, in 1907, passed the first federal statute that limited corporate contributions to campaigns, right? But corporations quickly found out, well, we can just do expenditures. We don't contribute to the campaign. We just spend our own money, but within this framework, both corporations and unions could do a lot of things."
Social Studies,"For example, they could run ads that said things like, you know, Congressman Jones is a no-good, anti worker, worker line person who wants to destroy American industry. Call Congressman Jones and tell him we don't need his agenda in Washington, and that didn't count as a campaign expenditure, because it didn't specifically urge people to vote for or against a candidate. - [Rick] So, President Bush signed a law, President George W."
Social Studies,"Bush, signed a law called the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, and this was in 2002, I believe it was, and it's commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Law, because those are the two big Senate sponsors, and the National Rifle Association, Senator McConnell, a bunch of people sued and argued it was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"While the case was going through the courts, the National Rifle Association, which definitely has a political point of view, set up a satellite radio station called NRA News, and they said oh, well, if news organizations can engage in this unlimited kind of electoral activity, we'll just make ourselves a news organization, and many people thought this was going to be a kind of sham way of just running political ads all the time."
Social Studies,"Well, what happened was that the NRA News actually started having news programs, opinion programs, call-in programs, not just on the election, but on issues that would matter to people who were sympathetic to the NRA, and it actually became a bonafide news organization."
Social Studies,"- [Bradley] So, the McCain-Feingold Law, or the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, as it's officially known, attempted to close this alleged or perceived loophole by saying okay, a corporation or a union can't even mention a candidate in a broadcast ad within 60 days of a general election, or within 30 days of a primary election. So, enter a group called Citizens United."
Social Studies,"- [Rick] Citizens United is an ideological group that is doing political activities, still around, and they had made a documentary called Hillary: The Movie. This was coming out at the time, not of the past election that we just had, but back in 2008, in that period when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were going to be competing for the Democratic nomination to be President, in the 2008 period, and Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation. That is, they're not selling shoes."
Social Studies,"They're just using the corporate form to be able to engage in associational activity, and there had already been a rule, well before the Supreme Court had established, which said if you're an ideological corporation, and you don't take money from for-profit companies, you can already spend whatever money you have in your treasury on political ads and political activity, but Citizens United deliberately took money from for-profit corporations, and they did it because they were trying to set up a test case."
Social Studies,"What they wanted to do was to take this documentary they had made, Hillary: The Movie, which said very negative things about Hillary Clinton, and they wanted to pay Comcast Cable a million dollars to make this movie available as a video on demand, which anyone could watch by choosing it from, you know, their cable guide."
Social Studies,"They'd be able to watch it, and under the federal statute, the Federal Election Commission said this looks like it's going to be on television, broadcast in a period close to the election, and it's going to feature the name Hillary Clinton, who's a candidate for President, and that would make it an election ad. It cannot be paid for by corporate funds."
Social Studies,"There were lots of ways that the Supreme Court could have gone, aside from overturning earlier cases, but the court was bold here, and on a five to four vote, the liberals on the court against the conservatives, the conservatives won, and the longstanding federal prohibition on corporations and labor unions as well spending money in federal elections fell. - [Sal] So, just as kind of a lay citizen, you know, on the face of it, I understand why there's all of this Congressional legislation."
Social Studies,"You're afraid of undue influence from corporations, but you know, we were able to talk to a few experts who, I think, took a more sympathetic view to the Supreme Court ruling, and their point was Citizens United was this organization."
Social Studies,"It definitely had an ideological point of view, and it was making this content that was clearly anti-Hillary Clinton, but there's many organizations, media organizations, you know, I think we could point to news channels, websites, which most people would consider to be news organizations or media organizations, that do definitely lean one way or the other, left or right, and they're arguing that the reason why the Supreme Court had to rule this way is if what Citizens United wasn't allowed, then whether you're talking about an MSNBC or a FOX News, that that would start putting them under scrutiny."
Social Studies,"- [Rick] Well, the law that limited what corporations can do created an exemption for press organizations that were engaged in journalistic kinds of activities, and indeed, the majority on the courts said we have to treat them the same. - [Bradley] The justices expressed real concern about the nature of the government's argument."
Social Studies,"They said, you know, you're saying you can limit broadcast ads, but what about internet? Could you limit communications about candidates over the internet? And the government attorneys eventually said yes, we can."
Social Studies,"We can limit anything that involves a corporation speaking about a candidate for office, whether it's on the internet or whatever, and by the time the oral argument was over, the government had asserted that it would have the right, for example, to limit the publication of a book that included one line of advocacy urging people to vote for a candidate at the very end of a long, you know, 500 page book."
Social Studies,"They had suggested that they could prohibit a union from publishing a pamphlet that advocated the election of a candidate. You could envision, you know, a candidate, something like why working Americans should support, you know, Hillary Clinton for President, or something like that. They had suggested that books over Kindle could be banned under existing law, and so, the Supreme Court said alright, this is very problematic to us."
Social Studies,"They scheduled it for a second oral argument, heard the case again, and at the end of the case, said we don't think that this is right, at least a majority did, said you cannot limit the speech of a group of people or a body simply because it is incorporated. - [Rick] But there was an argument of the dissenters that said the press is different."
Social Studies,"The press serves an educational and informative function, which is different than the function of other corporations, and it's permissible, maybe in part because the Constitution does provide separate protection for the press. There was a big debate about what that means, to carve this out. Now, that does create an inconsistency."
Social Studies,"We'd be saying we're gonna treat Google one way and FOX News and The New York Times another, but the current law is also inconsistent, so let me give you an example from the other side, which is think is very hard for those who support Citizens United to answer. In a case that came a couple of years after Citizens United, there was a guy who was a Canadian law student, then he became a lawyer in New York."
Social Studies,"He went to Harvard Law School, worked in New York, and he was here on a work visa, and he wanted to, according to his complaint that he filed, he wanted to go to Kinko's and make flyers, spend 50 cents making flyers, saying re-elect President Obama, and he wanted to hand those flyers out in Central Park. Well, because he was not a citizen, even though he's in the United States and has other kinds of First Amendment rights, even though he's not a citizen, he would violate federal law."
Social Studies,"He could go to jail for years, face a $10,000 fine, if he hands that piece of paper to one person, because then he'd be engaging in election-related activity as a non-citizen, and this case went up and the Supreme Court had a chance to explain why, as in Citizens United, if the identity of the speaker doesn't matter in the First Amendment, really, it's always about more speech all the time in elections, why is it that this guy, Benjamin Blumen, could be shut up? And the Supreme Court didn't even hear the case."
Social Studies,"It came up on a special kind of appeal from a three-judge court, which means that, when the court declined to hear the case, it agreed that the lower court was right, that this law is constitutional."
Social Studies,"So, we now have this new anomaly, which is that we say that non-human entities, these corporations that only exist because the state allows it to create this fake thing, non-human entities have these First Amendment rights, but yet a human being who was living in New York who wanted to spend 50 cents, he couldn't do that, and so, what's the difference, if it's really true that the identity of the speaker doesn't matter, which the Supreme Court said to Citizens United? Well, certainly, the identity of the speaker matters when that speaker is a foreign individual, or a foreign government, or a foreign corporation."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So, it seems like the majority opinion, they're not saying that large corporations being able to funnel tens or hundreds of millions of dollars for or against a campaign, independently of the candidate, that that won't necessarily corrupt, but it's more of by trying to regulate it in the way that the McCain-Feingold Act does, it actually has far-reaching consequences, or trying to regulate it in the way that the Federal Election Commission was trying to regulate it with Citizens United, it has far-reaching consequences that touch on just general free speech issues, like what you just talked about, you know, a sentence in a book that happens to be published or sold during the election, or a movie made by a random filmmaker."
Social Studies,"- [Bradley] I think, for one thing, for example, a lot of people, again, they resent to say that corporations aren't people, but they don't realize corporations have always, again, had some of these rights, acted as corporations, and acted in the political arena in a variety of ways, and I think that what these people should ask themselves is, well, if Exxon were not incorporated, would they go oh, well, Exxon's not incorporated."
Social Studies,"Well, that's fine, let them spend all the money they want, right? And conversely, I find most of these people, if you say, well, should we be able to censor The New York Times? It's a corporation? They say well, no, no, no, not that, and when you see that, I think it makes people realize the question is not really whether it's a corporation speaking or not. The question is whether or not we think the First Amendment protects the expenditure of money."
Social Studies,"- [Rick] We actually had to have rules before Citizens United to differentiate, because, actually, this was the law, that Google and General Motors could not spend their funds directly on election speech, but The New York Times and FOX News could, and so we had tests, and the Federal Election Commission had tests, and there are just some disagreements about how to best do it."
Social Studies,"I would point to the work of Professor Sonja West at the University of Georgia, who has written extensively on this, and she said the test should be people who are regularly engaged in journalism. That doesn't mean it has to be objective and you can't have a point of view. It doesn't mean there's a problem with FOX News or MSNBC, because they might have a point of view, but it means you're doing something other than electioneering."
Social Studies,"- [Bradley] I do think that, yes, that's what I'm saying, that these are some of the costs of having a vibrant, robust First Amendment, and if you want to give the government the power to regulate, you know, books to movies, you should think about who's the politician you most hate? Is it Hillary Clinton? Is it Donald Trump? Is it somebody else? Do you want them in charge of deciding who gets to speak out in politics and in what way and in what fashion and what manner? And I think you should think about it in those terms, and that sometimes makes people realize maybe it's best to let things go."
Social Studies,"Now, I would say, however, having said that, that a lot of the arguments about corporate influence are vastly overblown. There's quite a bit of debate, really, about whether or not corporations, in fact, benefit from spending money on politics. Big corporations, you know, the Fortune 500 types, what they really like to do is spend money on lobbying. That's much more direct. They can talk to candidates directly. They can let other people elect folks."
Social Studies,"There's almost certain to be some folks elected who they will like and they can go work with those people and craft messages and bills, and they can do this more behind the scenes, and that way, they don't have to offend any of their customers who don't like the party that they're supporting, but it's also clear that just spending money doesn't automatically win the elections. You can look at the last presidential election."
Social Studies,"I mean, Donald Trump spent, all totaled, about a quarter of what the Hillary Clinton forces spent. It certainly helps to have money, but in the end, it's not dispositive. What the money does is it's spent to try to inform voters, and those voters go out and vote at the polls."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] So we've learned that, in Citizens United, the Supreme Court ruled that political spending by corporations, associations, and labor unions is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment, but whether or how the government can limit free speech in campaign contributions is still a matter of debate."
Social Studies,"As Rick Hasen notes, one test for the difference between the free speech rights accorded to journalists and those or corporations might be whether they are entities regularly engaged in journalism, but as Bradley Smith points out, allowing the government to impose limits on how people or corporations speak out in politics may lead to unintended consequences.

Social Studies,government and politics..
Social Studies,"-Penalty- Which is now being referred to as a tax by many folks. And the idea here is that there are obviously many folks who are uninsured right now, and when they get sick especially when they get very sick they still get healthcare. In particular they will go to the Emergency Room. They will go to the E.R., and that is quite posiibly the most expensive part of the healthcare system to interface with."
Social Studies,"So there's kind of a moral argument here, that- 1) These people are getting sicker than they need to get if they had insurance. e.g. getting preventative care and not getting that sick. Then there's a financial or, I guess you could say, a fairness argument: that these people are getting sick, going to the E.R., and they have to be given care at that E.R. The Hospitals bear those costs, and then eventually recoup those costs by charging more for all sorts of other services."
Social Studies,"[These costs] go back to the people who are paying for the healthcare. So, if you have an Individual Mandate it will clear things up a little bit. People will have to essentially pay for the healthcare they are already getting. Now, the argument against the 'Individual Mandate' is that this is the Government putting into law that people *have to buy something*. In particular, that they have to buy health insurance."
Social Studies,"Now, the counterargument that many people make is that there is something similar going on with car insurance. If you want to drive in most states, you have to buy some type of car insurance or at least show that you have financial abilities to pay any liabilities you might have if you get into an accident. Now the 'Counter-Counter-Counter-Argument' to that is that, driving is something that someone chooses to do."
Social Studies,"That you do not have to drive, while in the case of health insurance, this is something that every person in the country is being forced to [purchase].  I'll leave it to you to decide where you sit on that, and what balances what other issue. Now, obviously, if you're going to decide whether you want insurance, or whether you are going to pay a penalty/tax, you have to figure out how high that penalty is going to be on you. Or if you want to figure out if this is a fair situation."
Social Studies,"You have to think about high that penalty is going to be. And the current provisions say that by 2016, which is when the full penalties take effect, you are going to have to pay the maximum of either 2.5% of your income, or $695 for an individual, or $2085 for a family.  And there are exceptions, and this whole individual mandate won't apply to you if having/getting insurance will cost you more than 8% of your total income."
Social Studies,"or if you belong to a religion that does not participate in the healthcare system, then it doesn't apply. So you will never have to pay more than 8% [of your total income] to get an insurance policy. But these are the general penalties; If you made $100,000 and chose not to get the insurance, you would pay $2,500 (2.5% of income, and is greater than the minimum penalties). If your [family] makes $50,000, then the 2.5% [$1250] would be less than the [family] minimum, so you would pay $2085."
Social Studies,"Now the other provisions of the PPACA are based around the idea that, ""If we want people to get insurance, - then we need to make it easier for them to get insurance"" The biggest deal, at least in my mind, is this one covering Pre-Existing Conditions. Right now, if you have a Pre-Existing Condition, e.g. Cancer, and you do not have insurance, or your employer does not cover it - or perhaps you are unemployed - and if you try to get insurance on your own, you are likely to be denied."
Social Studies,"If you are offered insurance, it will be ridiculously expensive. This is because the insurance company knows that they're going to take a huge loss on paying all of your medical expenses. The PPACA says that you can no longer base the premiums, or whether you will or not give someone insurance based on Pre-Existing Conditions. People will be charged premiums, which what you pay to receive the policy, based on age and geography."
Social Studies,"So if you have two 40-year-olds, and one of them has the misfortune of having cancer, the other not having any pre-existing conditions; and they both live in, let's say, in Virginia. Under this, they will pay the exact same amount for insurance, the same premium. These other two points are just to make it easier to get insurance. Right now, if you've ever tried to get insurance, it can be really hard to compare and contrast policies, and to really understand what you're getting and what you're not getting."
Social Studies,"So this part of the Act says that every state will set up one of these Insurance Exchanges, which will allow for more transparency in terms of buying and selling policies. And then this final part here, -though this is just an overview, I'm not covering everything, not all the details- is the idea that the Government will also subsidize people getting policies, especially if they are in lower income brackets, or in more difficult financial situations."
Social Studies,"Now on top of this, if you're deciding whether or not you support things, if you're saying, 'This might be a good idea', or 'This is a bad idea' because you don't like the government forcing things like this, there is also the issue of the Cost.  Now this whole thing, even thought there might be savings in terms of lower medical care, because people would get preventative healthcare, there is still a Net Cost to this."
Social Studies,It will primarily be paid for by an increase to the Medicare Tax for high-income brackets. So it's really going to be larger Medicare taxes on people with larger incomes.
Social Studies,"This is estimated to generate about $200 Billion a year, (or $210 Billion, there are different estimates) but that's going to bear most of the costs, and on top of that, there are some extra fees on insurers, as well as what's called an 'Excise Tax', which tends to be a large tax on a specific type of policy, which are referred to as 'Cadillac' policies. These policies are very very very generous. This will be used to make up some of the cost of all this."
Social Studies,"Once again, I'm not going to take any political sides on this, but hopefully this gives some clarity about what people are actually debating.."
Social Studies,"So the first thing to frame this conversation is just where the budget is right now. And so let me draw a little graph. So let me make this axis right over here represent our budget. I want to make it as big as possible so that we can get a little bit of granular detail on how much the budget might move based on how the negotiations work out. So let's say that this line is roughly $4 trillion long. So that's $4 trillion, and halfway would be about $2 trillion."
Social Studies,"And then in between two and four, you've got $3 trillion. And then $1 trillion would be right over here, $1 trillion. And then I'm going to do some bar charts to show the different scenarios. And as I do this, keep in mind the size of the US economy. The US economy is approximately $15.5 trillion. So that is roughly our GDP, depends on which year you're measuring. But that gives us at least a frame of reference for what chunk of GDP we are talking about when we talk about the federal budget."
Social Studies,"So let's start with the 2012. Let's start with the 2012 budget. So in 2012, the US government is spending $3.6 trillion. So let me make my graph a little bit more granular. So this would be 3.5. So 3.6 is going to be right around here. So let me draw that. And I'll do it in this purple color for the expenditures. So this is how much the federal government spent or I guess is spending in 2012. So just like that. All right, there we go. So that's expenditures."
Social Studies,"Now you are probably aware that we don't have all of the revenue. We didn't bring in the $3.6 trillion in taxes. So this right over here is $3.6 trillion. Our revenue that we get through tax revenue and other things is somewhat less. It, in 2012, was on the order of $2.5 trillion. So I'll draw that right over here. So $2.5 trillion. I'll do it in this green color. So this is how much revenue was brought in. So let me write this down. This is $2.5 trillion."
Social Studies,"Now let's think about how much might get spent under the different scenarios. So first I'll lay out a rough approximation of Obama's budget proposal for 2013. So Obama in 2013. So on the spending side, he sees, or he would like to see, spending go up by $200 billion. So let's see this. So on the spending side, we're going to add $200 billion. And the next few videos, we could talk about the pros and cons, the arguments for and against something like that. So let me draw that."
Social Studies,"So relative to the 3.6, we're now that 3.8. So you have a spending increase of-- so plus $200 billion. That gets us to 3.8 billion in total expenditures. If my best estimate of what the Republicans in Congress would want. So let's write. Let's say, a Republicans in 2013 is that they would actually ideally want spending cuts from these levels. So let's draw that out. And roughly on the order of about $100 billion. So roughly on the order of $100 billion."
Social Studies,"They might even want more than that, but let's just go with that for now. So that gets us to a budget of $3.5 trillion. That's about that right over there. $3.5 trillion. So once again, relative to 2012, you're going down by $100 billion. Let me make clear. You're subtracting $100 billion. Now in the fiscal cliff scenario, the spending will be similar to the Republican ideal right over here. So let me write this over here. Fiscal cliff. We are also spending."
Social Studies,"We are cutting on the order of $100 billion in government expenditures. So let's draw that. So at least on the expenditure side. And these are all very rough. I'm sure the Republicans who would agree and disagree with this. But I'm trying to get my best sense of kind of an aggregate view on things. So the fiscal cliff. We are also cutting spending by $100 billion. Now let's go to the revenue side of things. In all of these scenarios for 2013, and just to be clear, the fiscal cliff that's also for 2013."
Social Studies,"And all of these scenarios, we get the same revenue that we got in 2012. So let me draw that. Plus we get about another $100 billion from the growth in the economy. As the economy grows, and even if your tax rates are held completely constant, you're going to get more revenue for the federal government. You get about $100 billion from the federal government. And so that gets us to $2.6 trillion without changing anything. So let me just shade all of these in really fast. So shade that one in."
Social Studies,"Shade that one in. And then, shade that one in. Now, as you've probably heard on the news, Obama would like to extend the Bush tax cuts for the middle class. And he considers a middle class of those who are making less than $250,000 for a family. But he would like to not extend the Bush tax cuts on the rich. And he would like to actually include a few other tax increases, also on the wealthy. And so you would get an increase of revenue under Obama's plan of $300 billion. This is once again, very rough."
Social Studies,"Probably $50, $60 billion that I'm not fully accounting for, but it'll give you the rough picture. So this is $300 billion. And what Obama's doing here, or what at least in the proposal, as far as I can believe, none of this is that simple. What they're talking about right over here is extend tax cuts for middle class, which my best reading, seems like we would lose a little under $200 billion of revenue. But then we keep the tax cuts or we let the tax cuts on the wealthy expire."
Social Studies,"So that gets us 200 of this. And then there are other tax increases and another removing loopholes and whatever else they increase this to $300 billion. So let's compare the deficit. So this gets us to, in the Obama scenario, we end up with $2.9 trillion in revenue. So let's compare what the deficit did from 2012 to Obama's budget plan. So in 2012, if you take $3.6 trillion, subtract out $2.5 trillion, there is a gap $1.1 trillion. This is the deficit. This is how much the government has to borrow in 2012."
Social Studies,"Under Obama's budget, what would it be for 2013? Well we're spending $3.8 trillion. We are getting a $2.9 trillion. So you have a gap of $900 billion. So there is some of the deficit reduction, although the deficit is still quite large. The deficit reduction is $200 billion. $100 billion of that came from the economic growth. And then, the rest is coming from, or a good chunk of that, is coming from increased taxes."
Social Studies,"Depending on how you view it, either increase taxes on the wealthy or not letting the tax cuts expire on the wealthy. Now let's think about the Republican situation. Well, you have $2.6 trillion in revenue. And you have $3.5 trillion. Let me write this down. And once again, you have on the order of a $900 billion gap. So in terms of deficit reduction, these things look pretty similar. You have a very similar deficit. Obama is increasing spending."
Social Studies,"And he would argue that he's investing in things that might help stimulate the economy, or invest in America for the future. And then he's making it up by letting the tax cuts on the wealthy expire for the most part. The Republicans want to cut spending. But they're also letting the tax cuts continue. So you essentially have the same level of deficit reduction. Now I think we are ready to talk about the fiscal cliff. The fiscal cliff, we're spending hundreds billion less."
Social Studies,"And then we are also letting all of the tax cuts for both the wealthy, those who are earning at a family level more than 250,000. And for the middle class, we're letting them all expire. And so you have the revenue increase by $400 billion. So this goes up by $400 billion. And so that takes us roughly, once again, this is all rough, to about $3 trillion in revenue and $3.5 trillion in expenses. And so your deficit, under the fiscal cliff scenario, the deficit is going to be $500 billion."
Social Studies,"Now you might say, hey, this is great. Everyone talks about the deficit. The deficit is a scary thing. We are borrowing from the future and all that. Why are people so afraid of the fiscal cliff? The reality is that if you take $500 billion out of the economy. So $100 billion through spending cuts and then $400 billion from tax increases. So the government is deleveraging. But that money's being sucked out of the economy."
Social Studies,"And you could argue that there's just kind of a multiplier effect as well, that might endanger what's already a very precarious risk of recovery. That the recovery is really just starting to happen. And if we were to suck all of this money out of the economy, that's what the argument would be, then that might throw us into another recession. Or that might make the recovery that much weaker. In the next few videos, we'll discuss that in a little bit more depth."
Social Studies,See what people are saying the impact might be. And what the arguments might be in either case..
Social Studies,"That it would be painful for both parties, and the thinking being that it'll force them to come, maybe, to some type of an agreement sooner than later. The fiscal cliff is what neither the Republicans or the administration want because it raises taxes, which the Republicans don't want, and, it reduces spending, which the president doesn't want."
Social Studies,"And the core argument, and we touched it on the last video and we'll go in more depth in this one, is just as we're beginning to recover from our last recession, it might not be useful for our economy to try to suck out $1/2 trillion. So let's think about the different issues at play. So right over here, we have some charts. Most of these are from the Congressional Budget Office. And there's a bunch of assumptions that go into this. And there many people will debate the assumption that they make."
Social Studies,"But they at least directionally show the right things. So this right over here, this first chart, compares deficits or surpluses. And really, ever since the early 2000s, we've been running deficits. And as we got into the late, I guess, '10s, or 2008, 2010 timeframe, 2009 timeframe. As we went into a financial crisis. When the economy contracts, you get hit in two ways when you think about deficit spending. On one end, you bring in less revenues. The economy is shrinking."
Social Studies,"And on the other end, you have to spend more. You have to give people more benefits. More unemployment benefits. Things like that. So whenever you see the economy shrink, you will see, naturally, all other things being equal, you will see deficits increase. And that's what you saw right over here. And on top of that, the government is trying to bail things out as doing stimulus spending and all that in order to minimize the effect of the deficit."
Social Studies,"And that's why you see here in 2008, 2009, we start running significant deficits. Now, what's interesting is what's going to happen going forward. And going forward, there's two of these scenarios right here. There is the CBO's baseline projection and then there's the alternative fiscal scenario. And just to be clear where we, we are entering this phase right over here in 2013. And the baseline projection is essentially if the government takes no more action."
Social Studies,"And if the government takes no more action, then the fiscal cliff will be triggered. We will essentially have $500 billion less in 2013's deficit. And so what you see here is that the deficits go down dramatically. We have to borrow less on an annual basis. Now, the alternative to fiscal scenario is if we essentially continue-- if we extend our existing spending, and if we continue to extend the Bush era tax cuts, we go along this path."
Social Studies,"And so if you care a lot about deficits, the fiscal cliff scenario, which is this top line. This is actually the fiscal-- let me write that in a color you can see-- that's actually the fiscal cliff scenario. It actually looks pretty good. Hey, look, we have much, much lower deficits in that scenario than if we were to continue the tax cuts, and if we were to continue the spending. So there that looks like, actually, an argument for the fiscal cliff. Now let's look at this."
Social Studies,"Now, this is-- we're going to talk about the aggregate debt. When we say deficit, we're talking about the shortfall in a given year. The debt is the aggregate amount that the government owes. So this is federal debt held by the public, historically and as projected in CBO's baseline. And CBO, when they project, they can only do so much in projecting how good the economy might be, or how bad it might be. To a large degree, they extrapolate from where we are right now."
Social Studies,"And right over here, you see debt as a percentage of GDP. So you could imagine during World War II, we had a lot of debt as a percentage of GDP. See over here after the end of World War II, we start crossing over 100% of GDP as our debt-- the aggregate amount that the government owes. And then it delevered. And then you see this rough trend, roughly from the early '80s until now, where we've had increasing aggregate debt."
Social Studies,"There were some moments in the late '90s, early 2000s, where we took it down-- very, very, very strong economy. We started running surpluses. We started to pay down some of our debt. But then we hit back on this debt increasing trend line. And once again, if we continue in the alternative fiscal scenario, which is really continuing to do what we do today, which is extend the tax cuts and continue to have roughly the same level of spending, you see that the debt only continues to increase."
Social Studies,"In the baseline projection-- this is actually the fiscal cliff scenario. This is where no new legislation has passed. Those triggers in which the Bush era tax cuts expire, and the spending cuts that are triggered by the fiscal cliff scenario hit, we run lower deficits. And we actually see that debt, as a percentage of GDP, actually starts to go down. Which is, at least from a balance sheet prospective, seems like a good thing. So these first two charts say, hey maybe this fiscal cliff thing isn't so bad."
Social Studies,"It will actually significantly lower the deficit on an annual basis. And as a percentage of GDP, we will as a country, delever. Now let's think about the arguments why well, maybe we don't want to be that aggressive when it comes to reducing our deficit, or reducing our debt as a percentage of GDP. This first chart right over here is the-- we'll read it right over here. It's the percent of our population that is employed. And you see right-- so it's a proxy for employment or unemployment."
Social Studies,"Or, in this case, it's employment. And you see we hit a major recession at the end of end of 2008. You saw the percentage of our population that is employed go down dramatically. We kind of hit bottom over here, and we're having a shaky-- hopefully, a shaky recovery right now. It's not even clear how good that will be. But hopefully we're having a shaky recovery of sorts."
Social Studies,"And so just as we're starting to recover, it might not be helpful to take, essentially, $500 billion out of the economy in order to pay down debt. So the fiscal cliff scenario might make us go back into a little bit of a lurch. And most economists are predicting about on the order of 1% slower growth if the fiscal cliff scenario were to hit. Actually, most economists-- not 1%, they're actually expecting about a 2% hit to the economy if the fiscal cliff scenario would happen."
Social Studies,"And rather from going from 1.7% growth, we might go to negative-- a slight recession, slight receding of the economy. So that's obviously not a good scenario that we want to be in. The other chart that I have right over here, these are yields on 10 year treasury notes. This seems like a very technical thing to talk about. But this is essentially the interest. One way to think about it is this is the interest that the government is paying when it borrows money for 10 years."
Social Studies,"And one of the main arguments for paying down debt is that, if the government keeps borrowing money, it's going to crowd out other borrowers. It's going to make demand for money high. And maybe the supply will be more and more scarce. And interest rates will go up. So a lot of borrowing could make interest rates go up. And then the other idea is, well, if there's a lot of just borrowing and spending going And if we don't have a lot of productive capacity, it could also lead to inflation."
Social Studies,"Or maybe when the government has a huge debt, they have an incentive to try to have inflationary policies. So that in real terms, that debt seems to be less. But when you look at the debt markets, and these are market driven numbers. The Federal Reserve does not control 10 year yields. The Federal Reserve controls short term yields. You see that we have historically low interest rates."
Social Studies,"So the bond market-- and there's some very smart people who make their living investing in the bond markets, one of the biggest markets, if not the biggest. It is saying it's really not worried about deficits. It's willing to lend to the US government at all time low interest rates. It's not expecting any inflation. If anything, the bond market is saying that the biggest risk in the economy is continued sluggish growth. The biggest risk in the economy is maybe even some form of deflation."
Social Studies,"So this super low bond yields right over here would be an argument that well, yeah, if you believe what the bond market is saying, we, one, definitely should not suck money out of the economy. And the risks of maintaining high levels of debt might not be as high as some people are saying-- that you're not going to see interest rates and inflation go through the roof tomorrow. Now, if you ascribe to the second point of view that, OK, yes, we should be responsible."
Social Studies,"We should start to at minimum lower our deficit, and over time, as a percentage of GDP, lower our debt. The other question is, how do you do that? The Republicans would want to do it mainly through spending cuts, while the Democrats would want to do that possibly through spending cuts, but also by letting some of the tax cuts on the wealthy expire, and maybe even adding some other tax. And so these two charts inform some of those positions. And I'm trying to give as balanced of an approach as I can."
Social Studies,"So for a Democrat, they might look at this chart right over here. And they might say, well, look, average tax rates for the highest income taxpayers-- if you look at a historical basis, it looks like it's relatively low. And a lot of this comes out of the idea that even though the marginal tax rates are higher than what you see here, high income taxpayers-- a lot of their income might be from capital gains, from dividends. Those are taxed at 15%."
Social Studies,"They also might have a more sophisticated accountants who can get them more deductions. And so that's why you have them paying-- and they're getting more sophisticated as time goes by. And that's why you see this trend going down. And so this could be an argument, well at least relative to historical basis, that this category of folks might be able to afford to pay more. There's also another argument in terms of a stimulus argument, or how to minimize the impact on the economy."
Social Studies,"So if you have $1 that you want to somehow stimulate the economy with. Well one, the government could spend the money. And there are many arguments-- very good arguments-- why the government is not always the most efficient spender of money, and not always spending it in the best way. But they will definitely spend it. So you give it to the government. You give to the government, they'll definitely spend it, and then some. So they'll definitely spend that dollar. At least it will enter into the economy."
Social Studies,"Now, if you give it to the middle class, they are also likely to spend it. Or, to spend a good chunk of it-- maybe save a little bit. And the argument would be that if you give it to someone who's affluent, they are likely to save it. Now, saving is not always a bad thing. If you are low on investment, you need more savers. If interest rates were going through the roof right over here. That means that we don't have enough supply of money."
Social Studies,"In which case, it would make sense that we would try to incent savers. So if you have a situation of-- in the late '70s, where you have inflation going through the roof. You want people to actually invest more. You want a higher supply of money. Makes complete sense to put more money in the hands of people who are likely to save and invest that money. But here, at least if you believe the bond market, it looks like we have a demand problem. That it's actually very cheap to get capital."
Social Studies,"If anything, there's a surplus of capital out there. But there's not enough demand in order for people to get the economy to run at its potential. So a Democratic argument would be, look, if we're going to have this dollar, the person that we're best off giving it to is the middle class. Or possibly to some degree, the government. Because at least they will spend it. It will help stimulate the economy here, it will go into savings, but that doesn't seem like what the government needs right now."
Social Studies,"Now, the counter argument that you might get from someone at the right is that, first, the government is just a hugely inefficient spender of capital. And there's a lot of evidence to-- you definitely need a government, but they don't always spend money in the most efficient-- and even sometimes it leads to levels of corruption."
Social Studies,"And often times, when you do something in the name of stimulus, maybe it might make sense to do it in the short term, but once that program is in place, it's very hard to remove that program. People start to depend on it, even when you, in theory, you don't need the stimulus anymore. It's a very hard to shrink the size of government. And there's some argument for that. If you look at outlays-- government expenditures as a percentage of GDP-- it does look like, on a historical basis, it is high."
Social Studies,"Now, to some degree, this is due to the fact that we have entered into kind of a major recessionary phase. You see that in all of the major recessions, the government gets less revenue and has to do more outlays. This happens in every-- well, I would say in most recessions. And this happened in dramatic form, where we started to have more outlays. We had-- actually this point, we had wars that we were funding. And we were doing these trillion dollar stimulus packages. And we have these trillion bailouts."
Social Studies,"At the same time that the economy was receding right over here. But just when you look at this, it does look like the government spending, as a percentage of GDP, is at historical highs. And as we say, as the arguement would have it, it's very hard to get that to shrink, even when it should be shrinking. And it's often being deployed in less than efficient ways. So I will leave you there. My intent really is not to sway you one way or the other."
Social Studies,But to really just hope that you have good information when you think about the issues surrounding the fiscal cliff..
Social Studies,"And it could happen as early as November 2, and it could happen as late as November 8. And it's going to be the Tuesday after the first Monday in the month. So it'll be November 2 if the first Monday is November 1, and it'll be November 8 if the first Monday is November 7. And so you go on election day, and you will see a ballot that will have the presidential candidates. It'll have their parties there. It will have the vice presidential candidates, and you'll vote for one of them."
Social Studies,"But in actuality, when you are voting for Candidate A-- and let's say Candidate A is a Democrat-- you're not actually voting for Candidate A. You're actually voting for a slate of electors who promise to vote for that candidate. And it isn't in most states proportional based on what proportion of people vote for one candidate or another. In most of the states, except for Maine and Nebraska, it is a winner take all system."
Social Studies,"So what do I mean by that? So right here, you have the breakdown of the United States, by state, of how many electors words each state gets. And the number of electors is essentially the number of congressmen that that state has. For example, California has two senators. Every state has two senators. California has two senators and 53 congressmen. And those of you who aren't familiar with it, every state gets two senators, and the House of Representatives is dictated by population."
Social Studies,"California is a huge state, two senators, 53 representatives. You have Texas, two senators and it has 32 representatives. You go to Louisiana, you have two senators and you have seven representatives. So the electors per state is based on the total number of congressmen, so the number of senators plus the number of representatives. That's what gives us 55 in California, nine in Louisiana, 34 in Texas. But what's interesting here is it's a winner take all system in every state except for Nebraska and Maine."
Social Studies,"In every other state, if I get 51% of the vote in Texas, I get all 34 electoral votes in the Electoral College. If I get 51% or even if I get 50.1%, just a slight majority of the votes in California, I will get all of the votes for California in the Electoral College. And in general, or in actuality, the president is whoever gets the majority of the electoral votes in the United States. And right now, that threshold is, or that magic number-- you could think of it that way-- is 270 Electoral College votes."
Social Studies,"If no candidate is able to hit this threshold of 270 Electoral College votes, then it will go to the US Congress. And in the US Congress, it's interesting, because it isn't one congressman, one vote. Or actually, I should say the US House of Representatives. It'll go to the US House of Representatives. And it won't be one representative, one vote. What will happen is the representatives in each state will vote together, and each state will get only one vote."
Social Studies,"So in a tiebreaker, the big states really, really lose out, because in a tiebreaker, Texas will get only one vote. California will get one vote. And Alaska will get one vote, and Rhode Island will get one vote. So Rhode Island will have just as much say in a tiebreaker as California will over who will be president. Then they'll just keep voting until someone gets a simple majority of the votes by state. Now, there's one other twist here."
Social Studies,"It's that the District of Columbia-- Washington, DC right over here-- in Congress gets no representatives. They have no senators, and they have no representatives. But they do get three electoral votes when it comes to deciding who is going to be president."
Social Studies,"Now, you might already be getting a sense here that maybe this winner take all system might lead to some distortions, and the biggest distortion of all is you can imagine a candidate who wins the popular vote and loses the election or loses in the Electoral College. And you might think, well, gee, how can that happen? And the way to think about it is, imagine someone-- let's say someone gets-- with the states that they win, they get huge majorities."
Social Studies,"So let's say there's a conservative candidate, and he or she gets huge majorities in the states they win. 80% in Texas. They get 80% in Mississippi. They get 80% in Oklahoma. The get huge majorities in the states that they win. And the states that they lose, they barely lose. And they barely lose those really big states. So let's say in Florida, that candidate gets 49% of the vote. So they had a lot of votes in Florida, but not enough to win it. The other person, let's say, gets 51%."
Social Studies,"All 27 go to the other candidate. Let's say the same thing happens in California. That candidate got 49% of the vote. The opponent, let's say, gets 51% of the vote. All 55 go to California. You get no credit for that 49%. You get no credit for that 49% in Florida. So in this situation, this candidate might actually end up with the majority, barely losing the states they lose, and trouncing the other candidate in the states that they win, but despite that, actually getting fewer Electoral College votes."
Social Studies,"Now, there's a few clarifications I want to make, especially ones that have confused me in the past. One of them is because you have the same number of Electoral College votes as you have US representatives plus senators, there's kind of this feeling that maybe each district sends its own elector to the state capital to decide who the president is. And it doesn't quite work that way. So this right here is the panel of electors for Louisiana in 2008."
Social Studies,"And you can see right over here, each of the parties have their own slate of electors. And these are either decided by the party themselves, or they're decided by the candidates' teams. And even though you have someone here for each district and then you have these at-large candidates, it's not like-- let's take a situation. This actually happened in Louisiana, where John McCain got a majority of the state. So John McCain and Sarah Palin got a majority of the state."
Social Studies,"It's not the case that-- let's say in the second district, which is New Orleans, let's say that the second district, a majority of the people actually voted for Barack Obama. It is not the case that Kenneth Garrett in 2008 would have been the chosen elector. Even though they divide things by district and they have these at-large candidates, it is actually a state-wide election. So they don't look at who won each of the districts. They just say, look, John McCain and Sarah Palin won the entire state."
Social Studies,"So all of these electors are the ones that are going to go to the state capital in December and decide who they want to pledge their vote for. So even if Obama won just the Second Congressional District, that's not how it's thought about in the Electoral College. It's just a state-wide election. McCain got the majority of the state. All of the electors will be chosen from McCain's slate or from the Republican Party slate. And then they're going to go to the state capital."
Social Studies,"In the case of Louisiana, it would be Baton Rouge. And they will decide who they want to pledge their votes to. And all of the electors in all of the states go to their designated location, usually the state capital, on the same day. And usually that is some day in December. And they pick the president, although by that point, everyone knows who the president is, because the actual election was in early November."
Social Studies,"And people know which way the votes went and which way the actual Electoral College votes went. Now, I did mention that there are two states that don't do this winner take all, Nebraska and Maine. And in Nebraska and Maine, when you go vote, it really is by congressional district. Nebraska has three congressional districts."
Social Studies,"So in those three congressional districts, if one of them goes to the Democrat and two goes to the Republican, then they'll have one electoral vote for the Democrat and two for the Republican. And then they have two at-large votes that are decided the same way, in kind of the winner take all basis. If you get 51% of the vote on a statewide basis, you get the two at-large votes. Same thing for Maine, but Maine has two congressional districts. So two of the congressional districts could go either way."
Social Studies,"And then the at-large are based on a state-wide vote. Now, you could imagine the other kind of unfair thing here, other than the popular vote versus the Electoral College vote. You could imagine it makes some states better represented than others. So if you just divide population by the number of electors, you see the larger states, each elector is representing many, many more people. This is California right here. Each elector is representing over 600,000 people."
Social Studies,"And in the smaller states-- this is Wyoming right here-- each elector is representing under 200,000 people. So in Wyoming, people are getting kind of three times the representation as they would in California on a per capita vote."
Social Studies,"But what makes it even a little bit more skewed, because it's winner take all and the candidates aren't silly and they want to make sure that they spend their money and their visits and their time in the most leveragable way, it actually creates this weird scenario where candidates will often ignore huge parts of the population. And they ignore them because those huge parts of the population are unlikely to swing one way or the other."
Social Studies,"So for example, California is very reliably Democratic and Texas is very reliably Republican. So this right here-- this is a fascinating graph, at least in my mind-- it shows where George W. Bush and John Kerry spent the last five weeks of the 2004 election. Let me close that right there. This top graph shows where they actually spent their time, so each of these little hands here is a visit in those final five weeks."
Social Studies,"And each of these dollar signs is a million dollars spent on marketing and advertising, on ads and whatever else, in those states. And you can see, California and Texas, the two biggest states, they didn't spend enough money to the threshold to get dollar a sign written there. So they didn't even spend $1,000,000 on these huge states. They only had a few visits to California, and Texas had no visits in the final five weeks."
Social Studies,"So what happens is that candidates spend a disproportionate amount of attention and money in the states that are more likely to swing one way or another. So the people in Florida or in Ohio-- so this is Ohio and Florida-- got a ton more attention, especially on a per person basis, than the people in Texas."
Social Studies,"Plus I promise I have no skeletons in my closet. I do not even have one in my body. - Hey, Grover, what are you doing? - Oh, hello there, Sal Khan. I am just running for president of the United States of America. I heard there was an upcoming election, so I figured, ah, why not? - Well, that's great, Grover. - Yeah! - Maybe we can help more people vote. - Oh, that would be terrific. So exactly how many votes do I need to win? - Well, you know about the electoral college, right? - Of course, Sal, baby."
Social Studies,"- I know exactly what the electrical-- - Electoral. - Electoral college is. - Great, so why don't we explain it together for those who don't know? - Oh, why certainly. What a brilliant idea. - Umm. Why don't you start us off? - Sure. In a direct democracy, I as a citizen will vote for a candidate. And whichever candidate has the most popular votes in the country, they will become president. But we do not have a direct democracy. We have an indirect democracy. So what happens is, is I vote in my state."
Social Studies,"I live in California. And whichever candidate gets the most votes in California will get all of California's 55 electoral votes. And that's true in most states. Whoever gets the most votes in that state gets all of the votes for that state. And that number comes from the number of Congresspeople California has. - Um, dah, I am not following you. - So how can I explain it in a way that you might understand? - Chickens. (chickens clucking) I know chickens. Chickens, they are my biggest demo."
Social Studies,"(chickens clucking) - OK, chickens. So instead of electors, we'll say chickens. Instead of the electoral college, I'll say chicken college. - OK, that I can follow. The number of chicken votes for each state is equal to the number of Congresspeople for that state. - [Grover] In every state? (chicken clucks) - [Sal] Yes, Grover. - From California to the New York island? From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters. - Yes. The 50 states."
Social Studies,"(Grover laughs) And so there are a total of 538 chicken votes in the chicken college. For example, Florida has 29 chicken votes. (chicken clucks) And that's the same as the 29 Congresspeople that they have, two senators and 27 representatives. - [Grover] Oh, hello there, chickens. (chickens clucking) OK, then, so how do I, candidate Grover, win the presidency? - Well, since there are 538 chicken votes in total, you just have to get more than half of those. - More than half. Hmm, let me see here."
Social Studies,"(trumpets play line from ""Stars and Stripes Forever"") One, carry the two, divided by eight. - Grover, we, we know the actual number. You just have to get at least 270 chicken votes in the chicken college. - Just 270 chickens? I could do that. 300 chickens just crossed the road to hear me speak at the rally. (chickens clucking) - Oh, great, do you have your speech? - Oh, yeah, it's just right here, yeah. Where did I put it, it? Ah, I'll just wing it. Bye, Sal. - Bye, Grover. Now get out there and vote."
Social Studies,"(chickens cluck) (violins play ""Hail to the Chief"")."
Social Studies,"And a national convention for one of the parties will look something like this. This is the Democratic national convention in 2008. You have all the delegates over here, and everyone's all excited and they start to cheer lead for their party."
Social Studies,"and for their candidate the republican national convetion looks very similar And although there's a lot of energy here there actually isn't a lot of suspense Going into the convention we usually know already who the candidates for each of the parties are going to be And that's because each of the states have their own selection process for picking a candidate As we get the results from we know how many delegates they're going to send to the convention and who(m) they're going to vote for But there's two ways they can select those candidates or those delegates at the national convention They could either run a caucus or they could run a primary And I'll start with primary because that's a little more intuitive It's kind of like just a election that is based on party for whom do you want to be your nominee at coming out of the convention So for any given state they will have both a Democratic primary and a Republican primary And on the democratic primary let's say candidate A gets 40% of the votes on that election Candidate B gets 30% of the votes and let's say candidate C gets another 30% What will happen is is that state's delegates on the democratic side So let's say that that state just for convenience Let's say they have ten delegates On the democratic side, that means that these delegates will go on to the national convention and represent the different candidates proportionally So out of these ten delegates 40% or four will represent candidate A Three will represent candidate B and three will represent candidate C when they go to the national convention On the republican side it's a little bit more nuance you could have similar results A gets 40% B gets 30% and C gets - now let me do different letters so these aren't the same candidates Let me do candidates D, E and F So you could have candidate D, candidate E, candidate F and let's say - let me do the percentages slightly different for fun So let's he has 45% over here let's say he has 25% over here and then let's say you have candidate F with 30% over here On the republican side it depends from state to state Some states will do it similar to the democrats where the delegates represent the candidates proportion to the votes they have While some other states have it 'winner take all' And so for example in a winner take all state, candidate D will get all 10 delegates And the reason why states do that is it's a stronger incentive for candidates to show up to that state if they feel like their in the running Because if they throw enough money and marketing in that state, that's a big deal to take all of the votes."
Social Studies,"On the other hand, if you're a smaller candidate and you don't think you can take it all, it may be a disincentive for you to even show up to that state and you might want to focus on the states where you can actually get some delegates So that's all the primary is."
Social Studies,"It's really a- you can kind of view it as an election That sell separately on the democratic side, separately on the republican side an those are used by the state's parties to decide which delegates go to the national party and whom those delegates are going to vote for A caucus, the point is the same thing To figure out who are your delegates that are going to go to the national convention and whom are they going to vote for but the process is a little bit different In a caucus, you essentially have- people get together in these events, these caucuses in different in these events, these caucuses in different precincts, and the most famous of these are the Iowa caucuses So in small precincts you'll have groups of fifty to a hundred people get together, and the different parties will have different ways of going about it but they have processes in place where people try to market for different candidates they campaign for different candidates and sometimes they'll have a cut-off that if one of the candidates at one of the precincts don't get at least 15% of the votes then those people who supported that candidate will have to give their support to another candidate they make sure that all of the delegates represent at least a certain threshold of voters but there's different processes in place But the bottom line is that at each of these pre-syncs they'll select delegates and then those delegates will then go on to the county conventions and then those delegates at the county conventions now these are representing more people will then pick delegates to the district conventions and then at the district conventions they will pick candidates to the state conventions and at the state conventions they will pick the final candidates that will go on to the national convention No the two most famous caucuses or primaries are the Iowa caucus which takes place in Iowa You have the New Hampshire primary which of course takes place in New Hampshire And they are important not because they pick so many delegates that those delegates will tip the balance necessarily These are small states they don't have that many delegates compared to California or Texas or Florida but what's important about both of them is that they happen very very very early on in the primary season and because they happen early on in the primary season the candidates that come off with the lead here it is easier for them to raise money they say 'Oh I want to give my money to a winner, you know I don't want to give it to a candidate who is just going to blow it and lose the money and lose the election regardless' So it gives you that."
Social Studies,"It also gives a big signal for who's a front runner because there tends to be dynamics for whoever wins or comes in in second place in the Iowa or New Hampshire primary that those are the people that everyone should pay attention to they get more fundraising it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy More people all of a sudden take a serious look at them Now the Iowa caucus just to be clear the primaries all happen in one day and you get the one, the polling results when people exit the polls and you also get the final result pretty quickly This caucus process actually takes place over many many months five months in the case of the Iowa caucus And the result, the thing that the press focuses on is not this final result, of who are the actual delegates that go to the national convention The thing that the press focuses on are the precinct convention where people get together Because coming out of those precinct conventions the state parties get the information on how many candidates each delegates won going into now the county convention And this, this is the indicator that the press and the media and everyone else likes to use to see who's a front runner in that specific party's primary And the reason why the Iowa caucus in particular gets so much importance is because it is the first caucus These results come out before anything else The New Hampshire primary this is the first time that you have direct voting for candidates so you're getting I guess getting a more direct number or your not having it distorted or maybe cleaned up depending on how you view it by all of the different processes that might take place within the precinct convention."
Social Studies,"So let's take a look, I guess a very simplified example, let's say you have some type of a country. And that country spends, in a given year, $10. But it's only bringing in $6 in tax revenue. So it's bringing in taxes. It's only bringing in $6. So this country in this year, where it spends $10, even though it only has $6 to spend, it has a $4 deficit. Def is the short for deficit. And well, let me just write it out. You might think it's defense or something. It has a $4 deficit."
Social Studies,"And you might say, well, how does it spend more money that it brings in? How can it actually continue to spend this much? Where will it get the $4 from? And the answer is, it will borrow that $4. Our little country will borrow it. And so the debt, maybe going into this year, the country already had some debt. Maybe it already had $100 of debt. And so in this situation, it would have to borrow another $4 of debt. And so exiting this year, it would have $104 of debt."
Social Studies,"If the country runs the same $4 deficit the year after this, then the debt will increase to $108. If it runs another $4 deficit, than the debt will increase to $112. Now that we have that out of the way, let's think about what the debt ceiling is. So you could imagine, the United States actually does. It's continuing to run a deficit. It's continuing to spend more than it brings in. And actually, for the United States, these ratios are appropriate."
Social Studies,"For every dollar that the United States spends right now, 40% is borrowed. Or another way to think about it, it only has 60% of every dollar that it needs to spend right now. So it has to go out into the debt markets and borrow 40% to keep spending at its current rate. And so if it's continuing to borrow, you could imagine that the debt keeps on increasing. So let me draw a little graph here. So that axis is time. This axis right over here is the total cumulative amount of debt that we have."
Social Studies,"We continue to have to borrow 40% of every dollar that we're spending. And so our debt is continuing to increase. And Congress has the power, or Congress has the authority, to essentially limit how much debt we have. So right now we have a current debt limit of $14.3 trillion. And even though Congress has this authority, the way that it's worked in the past, is this kind of just a rubber stamp. Congress has just always allowed the debt ceiling to go up and up and up to fund our borrowing costs."
Social Studies,"And if you think about it, that kind of makes sense because right now Congress is the one that decides where to spend the money. What are the obligations. And so the debt ceiling is like, OK, we've already agreed what you have to spend your money on. Congress is the one that figures out what we spend our money on, and what our taxes are. And so they say, look, we've already determined how much you have to borrow."
Social Studies,"It would seem kind of ridiculous for us after we've determined how much you borrow to say that you cannot borrow it. You cannot you cannot actually do what we've told you to do. And so historically, Congress has just kind of gone with the flow. They said, OK, yeah we've told you we need to borrow more money to execute-- the executive branch has to run the government-- for you to actually run the government based on the budget we told you. So they just keep upping it."
Social Studies,"And the last time the debt ceiling was raised was actually very recently, February 12, 2010. It was raised from $12.3 trillion, point actually $12.4 trillion to the $14.3 trillion. And this happens pretty regularly. It's happened 10 times since 2001, 74 times since 1962. So it's just a regular operating thing. And right now the Obama administration says, look, we've actually come up against our debt ceiling."
Social Studies,"We want to raise it, and ideally for the Obama administration, they want to raise it by about $2.4 trillion. So they want to raise it to $16.7 trillion, which will kind of put it off the table for a little bit. Put it past the elections so that we don't have to debate this anymore. The Republicans on the other the side, want to essentially use this, and this is a little bit unusual, to use this as leverage to essentially reduce the deficit."
Social Studies,"And not only to reduce the deficit, but it's in particular to reduce the deficit through spending And so that's why it's become this big game of chicken and why we're going up against this limit. Now, one thing that you may or may not realize is that we've actually already hit the debt limit, the current debt limit. And we hit that debt limit on May 16, 2011. I'm making this video at the end of July in 2011."
Social Studies,"And the only reason why the country's continuing to operate, and the only reason why the country has been able to continue to pay interest on its obligations, and pay issue social security checks, and support Medicare, and buy fuel for aircraft carriers, and all the rest, is that Geithner, who's the Treasury Secretary, has been able to find cash in other places, cash normally set aside for employee pensions and all the rest."
Social Studies,"And has essentially done a little bit of a bookkeeping, taking money from one place to feed another. But what he said, what he's publicly said, is that he won't be able to do that anymore as of August 2, So this right here is the date that everyone is paying attention to, August 2, 2011. According to Geithner, at that point, he won't be able to find random pockets of cash here and there and shuffle it around. And what he calls extraordinary measures."
Social Studies,"And at that point, the United States will not be able to fulfill all of its obligations. And so if you think about all of the obligations of the United States, this is a huge oversimplification here. So this bar represent all of the obligations. Some of those obligations are things like interest on the debt that it already owes. It already owes a huge amount of debt, $14.3 trillion."
Social Studies,"And things like social security, Medicare, defense, and then all of the other stuff that the country has to support, all of their other obligations. So if as of August 2, 2011, we cannot issue any more debt, and Geithner doesn't have any extra cash laying around with these extraordinary measures, then, if those are the only options on the table, The only option is to somehow reduce some of these things by 40%. Because 40% of every dollar we used to spend on all of these obligations, 40% are borrowed."
Social Studies,"And so something over here is going to give. We're not going to fulfill our obligations to one or more of these things, all of these things that we are legally obligated to fulfill. That Congress has said, these are the things that the United States should be spending its money on. And so at that point, it is perceived that we would have to default. And a default actually would be on any of its obligations. But in particular, we could be, especially if we have to cut everything by 40%."
Social Studies,"And we don't want to see retirees not be able to get evicted from their houses, or aircraft carriers not have fuel, or whatever else. We might defer, or try to restructure, or do something weird with our debt. In which case, we would be defaulting. And I want to be clear, a default, it's usually referred to not fully paying the interest on debt that you owe. But a default would be any of its obligations. The United States has this AAA rating."
Social Studies,"If the United States says it's going to give you a Social Security check, you trust that. If the United States says that it's going to pay for that Medicare payment, you trust that. If it says it's going to give you an interest payment, you trust that. All of a sudden, if United States does not fulfill any of those obligations, then all of the obligations becomes suspect."
Social Studies,"And the reason why this is a big deal, as you can imagine, if you borrow money, you've always been good at paying back that money, you're going to pay lower interest than other people would have to pay. But all of a sudden, for whatever reason, one day you default. You either delay your payment, or you say you don't have the cash to pay your payments, then people's like, wow you're a much riskier person to lend money to. So now I'm going to increase the interest rates on you."
Social Studies,"And so the perception is if the United States were to default on its debt, or any of its obligations, that interest rates would go up. And the reason why this would really not great is because it would make the debt and the deficit even worse. Then this chunk is going to have to grow. Our obligations are on debt. As new debt gets issued, we're gonna have to pay more and more interest. So it's going to just make matters worse. It's going to make the deficit worse."
Social Studies,"And on top of that, it's not just that the government's debt, the interest on the government's debt will go up, but interest on all debt in the United States will probably go up. Because government debt is perceived to be the safest, it's the benchmark. A lot of other debt contractors are actually tied to government debt."
Social Studies,"So you'll have interest rates throughout the economy go up, which is exactly what you do not want to happen when you are either in a recession, or when you are recovering from a recession.."
Social Studies,"If you look at the deficit, and I'm going to focus on 2010 in this video, in 2010, the government spent, so the spending for the government in 2010, was about $3.5 to $3.6 trillion dollars, and it brought in in mainly tax revenues, but it has a few other sources, but mainly tax revenues, it brought in about $2.2 trillion dollars. Based on this the overspending, or the amount of spending beyond the revenues, or the deficit, the deficit in 2010 was $1.3 trillion dollars."
Social Studies,"What I want to be clear on, this is only one way to account for spending versus revenues. This is not the way that most companies would primarily report their own income over the course of the year, or their own cost, or their own loss over the course of the year. Most companies would not just have to account for their cash outlays. That's all we're considering in this $3.5 to $3.6 trillion dollars."
Social Studies,"A traditional company would also have to include any other liabilities or any other obligations they're taking on. For example, if I hire you and I promise to pay you $50,000 over the course of the next year, and I'm going to pay them to you in cash, but I also promise that when you retire, I'm going to pay you $10,000. I'm going to give you a $10,000 per year pension. On a traditional income statement, I would not just expense the $50,000."
Social Studies,"I would definitely put that in my expenses, and the government would put that in their expenses, but I would also have to account for this liability that I'm taking on."
Social Studies,"I would also have to say, ""Look, in order for me to be able to afford a $10,000 ""pension at some future date, I have to make some estimates ""about when you would retire and how long you would live, ""and what interest I could get on money, and all of the rest."" But I would have to say I would have to set aside some amount of money so that in the future I can meet that obligation."
Social Studies,"Maybe I have to set aside $2,000 this year, and hope it grows properly over the course of the next 20-30 years until you retire so that I can afford to pay you that much. Who knows? But I would also have to account for it right here, that extra liability. The government, in the calculation of the deficit, does not account for that extra liability. It is taking on other liabilities. It is making these pension promises to government employees."
Social Studies,"It has obligations to the veterans and Veteran's Affairs and all of that. That is not accounted for in the deficit. It is accounted for in the gross costs. You see here, we said when we look at just the budget, we're talking $3.5 to $3.6 trillion dollars. That's direct cash outlays, or mostly direct cash outlays. If you include all of this other stuff, then it balloons to $4.5 trillion dollars, $4.5 trillion dollars."
Social Studies,"In a previous video I mentioned that the government right now for every dollar that it's spending, it has to borrow 40 cents of that dollar. If you really think about the total obligations that it has, and the total obligations being $4.5 trillion took on, viewed that way it only has about half of that. It only has about half of that coming in in revenue. So every dollar in revenue the government is taking on an equal amount of obligations that year."
Social Studies,"Some of that is going to express itself in terms of increased debt, and some of that is just going to show up as increased obligations. You can see both of those things are increasing year after year after year, and depending on who you talk to which side of the political spectrum, some people will blame it on Bush. They'll say, ""Look at this."" The spending increased under Obama, which someone on the right would say."
Social Studies,"But then someone on the left would say, ""Yes, but the spending increased ""because we have to do all of these bailouts. ""The economy started to tank at the end of 2008. ""We have to do all of these emergency things."" As soon as the economy tanks, you automatically, the deficit position gets worse because you bring in less revenue."
Social Studies,"Not only do you bring in less revenue because corporate profits are down, fewer people are employed, people start earning less, but you also have higher expenses because all of these automatic obligations kick into effect; unemployment benefits, Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits. Those increase so deficits naturally get worse, but the whole point here is to say regardless of what party you're on, things are getting worse, and they don't seem to be getting better."
Social Studies,"Generally, you'll always see this net operating cost, sometimes the net operating costs will look lower than the actual deficit like it did in 2008. That's because there would be some type of actuarial or accounting reestimate of the future obligations maybe the pension obligations or whatever. But in most years, we're taking on more obligations than just our cash outlays. That's why you see the operating costs so much higher than just the pure deficit right over here."
Social Studies,"This chart right over here actually goes into what the difference is, the actual difference. You see that it's mainly things like liabilities for veteran's compensation, military and civilian employee benefits, government sponsored enterprises. There is some downward revision of the TARP. I don't think you can see that. All of a sudden you realize that the TARP is going to cost us more in the future than you thought it was going to be."
Social Studies,"Even though you don't spend that $86 billion this year, you realize that you have an $86 billion higher obligation. If you add all of these, or I guess you subtract all of these from the budget deficit, then you're going to get the net operating costs."
Social Studies,"You might already find that depressing, but the point of this video is actually, that's just the beginning, because if you look at where we're going, the trajectory, it gets even more depressing because not only do we have this huge budget deficit, or this huge operating cost, this loss I guess you could say on an annual basis, but it's going to get worse and it's going to get worse not just from the overspending, not just from the overspending on the government programs, and defense and all of that, but because our debt is increasing so much that the interest, the amount we spend on interest is only going to increase."
Social Studies,"That just makes matters worse. The more you spend on interest, the larger your deficits. The larger your deficits, the more you have to borrow, the more you have to spend on interest. This is a long time line right here. It goes out to 2080, but it's pretty clear that something, something is going to give. As a percentage of GDP, the government, the size of the government has historically been around this depending on different periods in history, but in the recent past it's been in the 20% range."
Social Studies,"If you just let things go the way they're going to go, and a lot of these are kind of mandatory spending, things we've already obligated ourselves to, or what we think we've obligated ourselves to, it looks like the size of the government is really just going to take over the economy. It's going to grow over the next 20-30 years to 30%, 35%, 40% of the entire economy. If that by itself is not scary or depressing enough for you, then we just have to look at this chart right over here."
Social Studies,"We've already gone over some of this chart. This is the gross costs. This is the total amount we're spending, outlays, cash outlays and other obligations we're taking on, and accounting for it in some way in the present. Then you have the taxes that you're bringing in, and you see that this is your net operating cost that we calculated already. Then it shows your assets, the assets of the government, mainly buildings and land and things like that. The government has a lot of nice land and buildings."
Social Studies,"Then you also see property, plant and equipment, and all of that; aircraft carriers, whatever you want to throw into the mix right over here. Then you see the debt and there's been a lot of talk of the debt, but you might be saying, ""Wait. Even in 2010, ""right now as we hit the debt ceiling we have $14.3 trillion, ""but didn't we have like $13. something trillion in debt in 2010? ""Why does this only say $9 trillion?"" That's because we had another $4 trillion in debt that is not held by the public."
Social Studies,"This is just debt held by the public. The public includes things like foreign governments, but there's another $4 trillion that is held by the government itself so that is not accounted for. That $4 trillion is mainly excess funds from the Social Security Trust that are all invested in treasuries, but the government, at the end of the day, is responsible for the Social Security Trust. So it is not accounted for right over here. You have $9 trillion there."
Social Studies,"You have another $6 trillion that is seldom talked about which is benefits for federal employees and veterans. That's right over here, so huge obligation. A total of $16 trillion in liabilities. If that by itself doesn't scare you enough, or doesn't depress you enough, we just have to go down a few lines on the statement, and you'll see something that does. This right here is the expected, or the present value of the obligations for social insurance."
Social Studies,"The way that they talk about social insurance, it's both social security and things like Medicare. These things that we've promised we would pay to people in the future at least that we've told people that we will pay them in the future."
Social Studies,"The present value, and the easiest way to think about present value, and I've done videos that go into a little bit more depth on that is how much money given some assumptions, if you assume that if I put money aside, and that money grows at some rate, how much money would I have to put aside in order to fund those obligations? This value is over the next 75 years, and I want to make it clear."
Social Studies,"You might say, ""Oh, 75 years, of course, ""that's going to be a huge number."" But remember, we're assuming that we can grow money. We're assuming that obligations that are 75 years from now that if i have to pay someone $10 75 years from now, I don't have to put $10 aside. I might only have to put 50 cents or a dollar aside and assume that that 50 cents or dollar will grow by some percentage so that by the time 75 years go by, I'll actually have that $10. This is actually a discounted value."
Social Studies,"This is assuming that the money that you could set aside today that the obligation today, that it would grow to actually fulfill the actual amount that you have to pay. This should scare you. These are huge numbers. This close group are what they call the current participants. We could read the footnotes. Includes current participants receiving and/or are eligible to receive benefits for the Social Security and Medicare programs ages 15 and over at the start of the 75 year projection period."
Social Studies,"That's $43 trillion. Then open group. They have current and future participants. This is slightly lower because it's including people who are going to be paying into the program, and not necessarily taking out of the program. but it's still a huge, huge liability. It's twice as big as the official liabilities that the government takes on.."
Social Studies,"Or if someone passes away before that and they had paid into, or paid into this social security insurance, this OASDI, then if they pass away, it'll provide benefits for their survivors. Or if that person doesn't pass away, but becomes disabled and can't work anymore, it'll also provide benefits for them. Now, one very, very common misconception with Social Security is that it is somehow a form of a retirement savings account like a 401k or an IRA. It is not that."
Social Studies,"From the government's point of view, they actually do it more as a kind of insurance. But in reality, all it is a way of current workers to directly pay for the retirement of existing retirees. And the reason why they did this is when it started off in 1935, they wanted the current retirees to immediately get benefits. They didn't want to wait for the current generation to save enough money and only use their money."
Social Studies,"So they made it kind of a direct transfer from the current workers to the people who are using the benefits. And just to make the point clear, a traditional retirement account-- so let's say this is me over my career, and then I retire. And this is me after I retire. And so this is as I get older. So this is I'm aging as we go to the right. So while during my working years, in a traditional retirement plan, I would be putting money into some account someplace."
Social Studies,"And so this would be the case of an IRA or 401k. And so this is an account-- and with the cases of IRAs and 401Ks are tax deferred and you can invest this. You invested in, you can get some interest on it. So it can grow as you invest it, as you put more and more money into it. And you invest it well. And then once you retire, that money that you directly placed there, will be used to fund your retirement. Social Security is not this."
Social Studies,"When you pay the FICA tax, and we'll talk about that in more detail in future videos. When you pay that tax, you are actually not putting it into a little separate account that you will then tap into later. You are actually for the most part, paying current retirees, or survivors, or people with disabilities, you're paying their benefits. So the way Social Security works is more like this. You have all of the current workers paying their FICA taxes."
Social Studies,"And right now, at least I think these numbers are as of 2010, you have 157 million people paying into Social Security. And you have 54 million people receiving Social Security. And so this ratio is pretty good. This money is right now, as of 2010, 2011, it's enough money to pay for all of these benefits. And actually we are running a little bit of a surplus. And that surplus is put into a separate trust account."
Social Studies,"And it's normally informally call the Social Security Trust, or the more formal name is the OASDI Trust. But I'll just call it the Social Security Trust. And the idea behind this is, OK, we're running a surplus now. We can cover at least all of our current obligations and we have a surplus. And then as more baby boomers retire, and more people go from this side of the equation to this side of the equation, then we can use the trust to kind of make up any deficits we might have."
Social Studies,"Because as we have more people on the right, we're going to have to spend more. And we're going to have fewer people on the left. So we're going to have less coming in. But look, we had all that saved up surplus before. And so we can use that. And that might sound like overall a decent idea, but the problem is that this trust is going to start shrinking because of all the retiring of the baby boomers."
Social Studies,"And we estimate 2023-- and these things move around based on how much benefits to retirees get, the economy, how many people are paying into it, and a whole other bunch of assumptions. But we estimate is going to start shrinking in roughly a decade from now. And the really bad thing is this thing will be completely depleted. So we won't be able to provide that extra funding for this kind of, this deficit, not having enough money to pay for all the retirees."
Social Studies,"It will be completely depleted sometime between 2030 or 2040. And once again, this is a good ways out. So it's based on a lot of assumptions. But it's not that far out. This is actually going to affect-- let's see I'm right now 35 in 2011, so in 2031, I'll be 55. And this will essentially affect my retirement. By the time I retire, in I don't know, hopefully I'm around 2042. Actually I'll probably have to be 67, so what is that, 2045 or whatever I'm going to retire."
Social Studies,"Based on the current taxes that are coming in, the current level of the Social Security Trusts, the interest that the Social Security Trust is getting on its invested money, and it's all being invested in Treasury securities. So it's invested in Treasury. So it's not getting crazy. Interest it's getting only a few percentage points per year. But it has to because it has to be invested in a very safe place. So given this, there are three possible eventualities. Either the FICA tax goes up."
Social Studies,"So based on the number of people working here, you get more revenue per person right over here. Eventuality number two is the benefits go down, or even possibly disappear. And eventuality three is, by this time frame right over here, that other parts of the government's budget is going to have to fund Social Security to make up the shortfall. Because you don't have enough revenue coming from the FICA tax and you don't have enough money from the Social Security Trust. So other parts of the budget."
Social Studies,"But as we'll see, there wont really be a lot of other parts to the budget because you also have Medicare also growing. And actually Medicare is a really unsustainable one, the one that's growing even faster than Social Security. So this is very much in question whether there's even another part of the budget that you could possibly even take from.."
Social Studies,"And so it'd be FICA, and then some people will call it FICA tax. And this isn't just to support Social Security, or to be technically correct, to support the old age survivors and disability insurance. Part of FICA tax is for that, and part is for Medicare. And so to make things clear, the part that is Social Security, or what we associate as Social Security, which is really the OASDI-- did I get that right? OASDI. So part of it is for Social Security, and then that part is 12.4% of the gross salary."
Social Studies,"But half of this is paid for by the employer, half is paid by the employee. And we'll do a calculation in a second. So 6.2% and 6.2%. The part that's paid by the employer, that's part of the payroll tax, stuff that the employer pays above and beyond the gross income that they're giving to the employee. And we'll do that calculation in a second. The other thing that FICA tax is used for is Medicare."
Social Studies,"And this is for a total amount of 2.9% of an employee's gross salary, or 1.45% from the employer as part of the payroll tax and 1.45% from the employee. And if you add these two things up, you get 15.3% total FICA tax. 15.3% where, once again, half is paid by the employer and half is paid by the employee. Now, let's just do a calculation so that it makes a little bit more tangible sense of what I'm even talking about with this FICA tax. So let's imagine that you make $100,000 a year."
Social Studies,"And it's a nice number, because it makes the math easy. Then your employer-- employer, employee, let me write it like this. Employer, employee. So for Social Security, your employer will contribute 6.2% of this. So above and beyond paying the $100,000 gross salary, they will also pay 6.2%, or $6,200. And the employee will also pay $6,200. And that will be deducted from their paycheck, so what they get will be net of the $6,200. And then for Medicare-- let me do that in pink."
Social Studies,"Then for Medicare, the employer will contribute $1,450, once again above and beyond the gross salary of $100,000. And the employee will pay $1,450 out of their gross salary. So the total amount that is paid by the employer is $7,650 in payroll tax for this one employee. And the total amount by the employee is the exact same amount, $7,650. So just to be clear, if you wanted to hire an employee and pay them $100,000 in gross salary, you actually would have to set aside $100,000 and the $7,650."
Social Studies,"So the employer-- the total that the employer's paying-- or let me just think of it this way. The total that the employer has to set aside, if you include the salary, is going to be $107,650 so they can cover the gross salary plus this payroll tax over here. The net that the employee is getting-- and actually, this isn't even the net. I shouldn't even call it the net. The employee, after paying FICA taxes, is going to be the $100,000 minus the $7,650. But I won't even write that number down."
Social Studies,"I mean, what is that? That's $92,350, because that's before paying just the traditional federal income tax and the traditional state income taxes. So that's going to cut it down a good bit. So the employee's going to take home probably on the order of $60,000 to $70,000, so above and beyond this thing right here. So even though the employer's paying this much, the employee's getting a lot less in terms of what they get to take home."
Social Studies,"Now, one thing that I think that is worth mentioning is unlike traditional federal income tax-- and traditional federal income tax the first several 10s of thousands of dollars you make are not taxed. And then as you go up the brackets, each incremental dollar, as you enter one bracket or another, you start to pay a higher percentage on those. The FICA tax is actually very different. Some people would even call it a regressive income tax."
Social Studies,"And that's because you only pay the FICA tax on the first $106,000-- or at least this is the numbers in 2011. You only paid on the first $106,800. So someone who makes $200,000 will pay the same FICA tax as someone who makes $106,800. So you only pay on the percentage below that. And the reason why is that the person making the $200,000 will get the exact same benefits, as well, as the person who pays $106,800. And this number, essentially, they try to index it roughly to inflation."
Social Studies,"So it will go up over time. But to some degree, someone who makes, let's say-- well, someone who makes below this threshold is going to pay this percentage. Between them and their employers, they're going to pay this percentage of their income. Well, someone who makes much more than this will actually pay a smaller percentage of their income, but they'll end up getting the same benefits."
Social Studies,"And so that's one reason why it's considered regressive, is that as you make more money, you're actually paying a smaller percentage of your income on FICA tax. And the other reason why it's considered regressive is actually on the benefit side, because obviously someone who-- if you have two people receiving Social Security benefits-- so you have this person-- so this is when they turn 65. Let me put it this way. So let's say that you have two people. They work their whole lives."
Social Studies,"And let's say they both retire at 65, although that retirement age is increasing. It's slowly being indexed up. And then they retire. It's known that the wealthier people or wealthier-- and there's also demographics based on race and things like that. But it's known that wealthier people actually live longer, so they actually get benefits for a longer period of time. So they're actually able to get their benefits for longer. So it depends where you fall into it."
Social Studies,"Likely that even though there's this cap, someone higher up the income chain also probably did pay more into it. But they're also getting a bigger check for paying more into it. The check that you eventually get is based, to some degree, on what level of FICA tax you were paying. And they're very well likely to be able to collect these payments for longer than someone who maybe doesn't have quite the same, I guess, quality of life and doesn't actually live as long.."
Social Studies,"When you had this baby boomer generation, on the left hand side of this system right here. The baby boomer generation is this huge population boom that happened after World War II after the country was happy and all the soldiers had come back. They produced a lot of babies. You get this population boom. When this population boom was on the left hand side of the system, they were able to generate a lot of revenue to supply for the benefits for essentially their parents' generation."
Social Studies,"That did help build the surplus. The problem is is that they didn't produce; the population did not grow as much in the next generation. You could view that as a problem or a good thing. It's a problem in the context of Social Security because starting recently, and over the next few decades, this baby boom generation is going to move onto the right hand side of this equation. We saw that they will start to draw down even this surplus fairly soon."
Social Studies,"Because of this demographic change, the Social Security surplus will be completey depleted between 2030 and 2040. Medicare is very similar. You have some portion of the FICA tax is for Medicare. That revenue is used to pay for the health benefits of the retirees. Any surplus goes into a Medicare trust. That Medicare trust, the formal name is the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The problem with Medicare is that the situation is even worse."
Social Studies,"The Medicare trust, or we could say the Medicare system is already running at a deficit meaning that they're spending more money on the right than they're getting in on the left. They're already starting to draw down, already starting to draw down their trust. Social Security, at least the trust is continuing to grow until 2023. That's our best estimate right now; then it'll start drawing down. It'll get depleted between 2030 and 2040. In Medicare, the situation's a lot worse."
Social Studies,"In Medicare, we are already starting to draw down the trust. We are already spending more on beneficiaries than we are taking down; than we were taking in FICA revenues. The entire trust, based on our current assumptions, will probably be depleted in the next ten years; depleted in next ten years. What makes Medicare especially troubling, despite the fact that it's in a worse financial position, is that these costs are growing even faster. I want to be clear. A lot of people think that the ...."
Social Studies,"For Social Security, the main problem with this system over here is the demographic changes. You have this huge population that's retiring, the baby boomers, which makes this not sustainable. With Medicare, that's also going on. What makes Medicare even a bigger problem than Social Security is above and beyond those demographic changes, above and beyond these ..."
Social Studies,"this baby boomer generation retiring, instead of paying into Medicare, taking benefits from Medicare, the big problem is that you actually have medical health care costs For Social Security, these people's benefits could just go up with inflation. For Social Security, these people's benefits could just go up with inflation. For Social Security, these people's benefits could just go up with inflation. For Medicare, the benefits go up with the cost of medical care."
Social Studies,That's going well above the cost of inflation.
Social Studies,"You have the situation where, based on current benefits, and our best assumptions about the economy and the FICA taxes coming in, you have a reality where if you had to give the current benefits, and if you expect medical costs, health care costs to continue to increase at the rate they're doing, and there's no sign frankly that it is stopping, then you have this reality that Medicare left unchecked could; right now it's roughly about 23 percent of our budget, 23-24 percent of our budget, or about four percent of our GDP."
Social Studies,"Here we are in 2011. It's about four percent of our GDP we're spending on Medicare and Medicaid. Medicaid is essentially health benefits for mainly the poor. It's run by the states, but it gets federal funding. Right now, that's four percent of GDP. Because of the cost growth in health care costs, if we leave it completely unchecked over the next 50-60 years, it could grow to 15-16-17 percent of GDP. Just to be clear, that's the percentage of GDP that's roughly our entire federal budget."
Social Studies,"This has a potential, if we don't grow our budget any, to acutally crowd out a lot of other things. Just to understand this graph a little bit, they show the part and the cost of Medicare, the part of the growth due to different things. This is the effect of aging population. This is the effect of excess cost growth. This is the interaction of the two. To understand why that makes sense, you just have to think about the total cost being the product of the number."
Social Studies,"Maybe you could say the net number of recipients. Some people are paying in as well. This will hopefully help you understand what I'm talking about. Number of recipients, times the cost per recipient. Let's say that this is the cost per recipient. Cost per recipient, cost per recipient. If you take the number of recipients times the cost per recipient, you're going to get the total cost. Let's say that's the total cost today. That would be the area of that square."
Social Studies,"We're just multiplying the base times the height, current costs. Current annual cost, current cost. Because of demographic changes, you're going to have some increase in the net number of recipients. You're going to have some increase there. Because of medical cost growth, you're going to have a big increase in the cost per recipient. This thing is going to increase much more. If you go to some future point, and you can pick your future point."
Social Studies,"I'm really just trying to make you understand why we have these three categories. The total cost is going to be the total cost per recipient , that has grown dramatically, times the total number of recipients. Now you're talking about this area. This area is going to be the total cost. If you think about how much of this total cost is due purely to the increased cost growth, it would be this part right over here."
Social Studies,"This part would be the amount, the cost, the increase in the area purely due to the increased cost growth. That would be this part of the graph right over here. What part of this increased area is due purely to the increased number of recipients? That would be this part of the graph right over here purely due to the increased number of recipients. That is right over here, effect of aging population."
Social Studies,"You have some part of this area that's created by both the increase in the number of recipients and the increase in cost. That's going to be this area right over here, which is this part of the graph. When people talk about the unsustainable ... one we have an unsustainable debt to begin with. The second thing is is that the liabilities, the obligations that we have aren't even counted in the government deficit. These are the things that are really, really scary. Something has to give."
Social Studies,"In all of this, the single factor that's driving most of the scariness is Medicare in particular. Not just Medicare, but it's not just the demographic changes, but specific to Medicare it's the increased cost of healthcare. If somehow that nut can be cracked, if healthcare can all of a sudden grow maybe just with inflation, or maybe even slightly faster than inflation, but not at the rate it's growing right now."
Social Studies,"Then you could, to a large degree, mitigate the scariness of what's going on with our obligations.."
Social Studies,"You can even go to the government, even if the government wanted to do something about it, it really couldn't. Because once again, it's outside the US jurisdiction. The purpose of SOPA-and it seems fairly benign at first- is to give some tools to these actors to stop this."
Social Studies,"The problem-and we´ll see that it's quite a large problem- is that it gives tools to these actors to do much more than just stopping illegal activity; it allows them essentially to go on, to some degree, a kind of a witch hunt for anyone that might even have a whiff of enabling this type of activity. -it won´t even just be for foreign sites."
Social Studies,"So let's write this down, so SOPA stands for: Stop Online Piracy Act - and it sounds pretty reasonable - and this is the version of the bill that's coming from the House of Representatives. The one from the Senate, that's slightly different but they have the same intent, is PIPA [Protect IP Act]. And what it does is, if you can´t go after this site itself maybe you can go after sites that is somehow benefiting this site. And those sites are inside the United States."
Social Studies,"So this is outside, this is inside the United States. So things that are doing that might include search engines. So search engines like Google or Bing. They obviously link to this site over here. You might have ad networks - so sites that allow this site over here to display ads and to get revenue from them - that are benefiting this site over here. You might have payment sites like PayPal or credit card processors that this site uses to collect revenue."
Social Studies,"And, maybe most importantly, you have things like the DNS servers within the US that associate this site's domain name with the actual servers."
Social Studies,"And I wont get too technical about it, but when you type in something like www.shady.foreign , and once again, we´re gonna see that this site might not even have to be shady or foreign- but when you type something like that in - there´re servers in the United states that associate that with these servers that might be operated outside the United States - that associate this text with a number that points to this website, that points to this website's servers."
Social Studies,"So these are all things within the United States - that to some degree this site is dependent on. So what SOPA does is, it allows these actors here - the ones that are obviously concerned with enforcing their copyrights - to issue court orders and notices to these actors right over here that essentially compels them, very strongly, to immediately cut off ties with this illegal site - or what they think is an illegal site."
Social Studies,"Now that might seem reasonable to you, except for the fact that it's kind of a ""shoot first and think later"" type of policy. The basic way it works is, you presume guilt until this guy somehow tries to prove his innocence and we´ll see this guy isn't necessarily outside the US. It might even be completely legal, or what I would consider completely legal sites inside the US."
Social Studies,"Essentially as soon as this allegation is made and either a court order or a notice is payed, these enablers have to cut off ties to this site - and you can imagine that if these cut off ties to this site, - this sites´ business - whatever it might be - whether illegal or legal, immediately gets obliterated, especially this one here including search engines, ad networks and payments. And if they don´t comply then these guys are going to start having a legal battle."
Social Studies,"So these guys are not only going to have to comply-and that by itself is hard- but if they don´t comply, then they themselves are going to be in trouble. Now it gets really obviously creepy, when you start going into - so when you think of this - you´re like okay, so maybe we can work around this a little bit."
Social Studies,"But it gets creepy when you even know this is the spirit of the legislation, when you actually read the wording of the legislation- and obviously that's what matters, not the name or the intent- But actually how it's worded-I mean, the way it's worded - it´s pretty clear that its intent is to go after much more than just a site that's explicitly selling illegal pharmaceuticals or allowing people to download movies or, or videos or music that these owners don´t have access to."
Social Studies,"When you read the wording, it's pretty clear that they want to be able to shut down anything that is in any way associating with itself - or in any way enabling it. And you see it in the wording. So this is actually section 1.0.3 of the SOPA legislation - and this is how they define a site that is dedicated to theft of US property."
Social Studies,"So an internet site is dedicated to theft of US property if - and, so you know, it's useable by people in the United States - and this is interesting: It´s ""primarily designed or operated for the purpose of,"" ""has only limited purpose or use other than,"" ""or is marketed by its operator or another acting in concert"" ""with that operator for use in, offering goods or services in a manner"" ""that engages in, enables, or facilitates"" - now this is interesting - enables or facilitates all of these violations."
Social Studies,"And these are the violations that would be illegal: You´re selling things that you can´t sell, you´re infringing on other people´s copyright. And it might seem harmless, this ""enables, or facilitates"", until you think about what that could encapsulate. If I have a site, like this, I am part of a site: Khan Academy Let´s say someone puts a message on Khan Academy and from Khan Academy they link to a site that actually is really illegal and that is really shady and they link to it in the message boards."
Social Studies,"Well, under this am I enabling, is Khan Academy enabling or facilitating? And if that's the case, then Khan Academy - by this definition - would be considered to be a site that is dedicated to theft of US property. And there are much bigger players than just Khan Academy, that can be thrown into this bucket, players like YouTube or Vimeo or any site. Or even a news site, that allows people to put comments, or allows people to put images, things like Flickr."
Social Studies,"That maybe had - in some way - their users infringing on the copyright now all of the sudden the whole site - based on this definition - the entire site can be defined as a site dedicated to theft of US property. By this definition YouTube could be that, if it's viewed in kind of enabling or facilitating. Khan Academy, any news site could be viewed like that. Vimeo could be viewed that way, a photo sharing site could be viewed like that."
Social Studies,"People might take a photo or something that they don´t have the copyright and upload an image and all the sudden - by this definition - based on just a sense that that's being violated, they won´t just be able to shut down these illegal sites; they would be able to shut down things like YouTube, or Vimeo, or even things like CNN.com, if someone puts a message or an image, that they think is somehow violating."
Social Studies,"And so it's not just going-right now the methodology is, if there is some content on YouTube or Vimeo or some other site, that they feel is infringing on their copyright, there are laws, where they contact YouTube directly, they point them to the content, that seems to be infringing and YouTube, or Vimeo, or whoever will take down that content."
Social Studies,"But what this allows them to do is shoot first and think later: ""Oh, look: You´re enabling that""; if they could convince some court to give a court order, they can start giving notice to these players right over here to cut off ties with major - what I would consider very legal sites - like YouTube or Vimeo or CNN. It´s really almost any site that allows people to upload things onto it, or put links on it, which is almost - Facebook is another one - anything that has user generated content."
Social Studies,"On just a whim they could take down the entire site - not just take down that user generated content - they could, on just convincing one judge, or convincing just any of these, they could cut off ties with Facebook. Not even making Facebook.com point to Facebook anymore. CNN - they could just completely take down these sites on a whim."
Social Studies,"And it gets worse than that, because you would say: ""well, look, if they can take this down on a whim and, you know,"" ""maybe they kind of thought it was, but they didn't do their homework"" ""and then they realize that it wasn't copyright infringement,"" ""couldn't these guys sue back?""-although, already, the damage would have been done, these sites would have been taken down; they would have lost millions or billions of dollars; millions, or tens or hundreds of millions, of users would not be able to access these things and this would also be true for Wikipedia, if someone uploaded something that wasn't completely, 100%, vetted, they could take down the entire site, not just that content."
Social Studies,"And you say: ""Okay, that's bad enough!"" ""But couldn't these people say: `Hey, look, you wrongfully took us down,`"" ""`we´re going to sue you now`"". Well to see that they can´t and to see how one-sided this legislation is, notice: The threshold for being able to sued back, if you kind of misrepresented a violation - the only way you´re kind of held accountable is if you knowingly, materially misrepresented the violation."
Social Studies,"So, if the copyright holder just says: ""Oh, I think someone on YouTube""-you know- ""I feel pretty good that someone on YouTube is violating"" and that YouTube is enabling a violation and, therefore, YouTube is a site dedicated to theft of US property and it later on it finds out that it wasn't, it was fair use or maybe that person actually did have the copyright to it, they can´t be sued, because they said: ""Oh, I just thought it was""; they weren't knowingly materially misrepresenting themselves."
Social Studies,"So even if it ends up not even being a violation, these guys could take the site down. Maybe some small producers actually secured the rights, put it up on YouTube and then, all of the sudden, these guys take down all of YouTube based on not actually knowing what they are talking about. And there can´t even be a counter suit in that case, based on the law."
Social Studies,"And it gets even creepier than that, because to be considered this you don´t even just have to enable or facilitate - which is almost anything- one could argue a computer is enabling or facilitating this on some level. But you are considered to be a site dedicated to theft of US property, even if you do nothing illegal, even if you don´t enable anything illegal, but if you just take actions that make it difficult for authorities to confirm that you´re doing something illegal."
Social Studies,"So if you view this in the physical world: obviously, some people are doing illegal things in their homes and, obviously, some people lock their doors to keep people out of their homes. And maybe people are doing illegal things, it would even be more likely to lock their doors and close their shutters."
Social Studies,"What this would do-and this would do it in the virtual sense- is say: ""Look! Just by taking the deliberate action of closing your shutters"" ""and looking your doors, which makes it hard for federal agents to confirm"" ""that you´re doing illegal things - just by doing that - that itself is an illegal act"". This is maybe one of the creepiest and draconian Intrusions of privacy, that I have actually heard of, that was even attempted to be passed into law."
Social Studies,So if I were you - just as a kind of a privacy and liberty loving American - I´d be worried..
Social Studies,"Defined benefit plan for retirement. We can compare that to a defined contribution plan. Defined contribution plan. The defined contribution plan, and this is more typical in a lot of private companies right now, every year that you work, let's plot a little graph here. This is years that you're working, and this is kind of compensation. This is compensation right over here. In a defined contribution, every year that you work, you're obviously going to make your salary."
Social Studies,"Let's say you're making $60,000 a year. You're obviously going to make your salary every year that you work. In a defined contribution plan, let's say this is when you retire, let's say for simplicity, we're assuming that you're going to retire at 65. At 65, you're no longer going to be making your salary anymore. You're not working for that company anymore."
Social Studies,"What the company will do is set up some plan, and a lot of these are 401(k)s, IRAs, where some combination of you and the company will set some money aside, and it's usually done in a tax-deferred way, so you don't have to pay taxes on it in that year. Every year, you're going to set some money aside, and I'll do that in green. You're going to set maybe 10% of your income aside in every year, so these are every year."
Social Studies,"Actually, the years are going to be much smaller than that, if we're thinking this is about 30 years. Over the 30 years, you're setting some level of money aside, and you're investing it: you're putting it in the stock market; you're buying bonds with it; you're buying mutual funds. Who knows what you might be doing with it? You're setting this money aside, so that when you retire, it will hopefully have grown. Well, one, it's there, and you've invested it."
Social Studies,"Hopefully, if you've invested it well and the stock market didn't do anything crazy, it will have grown, and it will be just a big lump sum of money. Let's say that you set aside $6,000 a year on average for 30 years, so you set aside $180,000. Let's say you invested it pretty well, and now that has grown to, I don't know, let's say it's grown to $1 million, because it was invested well. We could do the math to figure out what it could grow based on different growth rates."
Social Studies,"You have this huge lump sum of money now. I'm not even drawing it to scale. You have this huge lump sum of money, $1 million, assuming it was invested well. If it was invested badly, maybe that $180,000 is still $180,000. In theory, maybe if it was invested really badly, it could be even less than $180,000. Whatever that number is, whether it's $1 million or whether it's $200,000, or whether it's something smaller, that's essentially the money that you have to live on for your retirement."
Social Studies,"Regardless of how long you live, regardless of what the cost of living might be, regardless of what your needs might be, regardless of how expensive your healthcare might be, this is going to be the money that you have to live on. It might be more than enough money, if you invest it well and you put enough money aside; it might be a lot less than you need, in which case you're going to be in trouble."
Social Studies,"A defined benefit plan, and this is typical; a lot of state employees have defined benefit plan, a lot of more traditional industries oftentimes that are unionized. You also have a defined benefit plan or a pension, and the situation is a little different. Just like any organization, you will get your salary every year that you work; and let's just say that this is over the course of 30 years. Once again, you retire at age 65."
Social Studies,"In defined benefit plan, the employer is going to set aside some money, and sometimes the employee sets some money aside as well, so some money is set aside. Once again, the money is set aside, and it is invested, hopefully in a safe way. But regardless of what that money and regardless of what that turns into through an investment, you are guaranteed a certain degree of benefits."
Social Studies,"In this case, you are guaranteed; let's say that if you'd done more than 20 years of service here, you get 60% of your last five years' salary. There's different ways of defining that defined benefit. It could be like that, it could be you get $100 per month for every year that you worked at the organization. You get $100 per month extra when you retire. But they tend to be for life, for the rest of your life. So from 65 until you pass away, you are guaranteed this defined benefit."
Social Studies,"If the money is set aside, if it was set aside and invested well and happen to be a lot more money than necessary, that's great, but all the employee would get is this kind of guarantee. If the money is less than necessary, then the company is still promising that they are going to pay this benefit. They'll probably have to put more, or the state, or whoever is doing this, would have to put more money in in order to pay this compensation."
Social Studies,"Now, what are the things that you would have to estimate if you are the person setting aside this money, to figure out what you have to set aside in order to give this defined benefit? You're going to have to hire a bunch of statisticians, essentially actuaries, to say how long are people going to live. You're going to have to care about life span."
Social Studies,"Obviously, you can't predict any one person's life span, but if you're doing this for hundreds of thousands of employees, maybe you can figure out what a likely life span is. You're going to have to figure out cost of living. Inflation is a measure of cost of living, but it might be more specific to the region, or it might be negotiated in some ways with the union. You're going to have cost of living. This is a cost of living adjustment."
Social Studies,"When people talk about COLAs, if they're not talking about soda, they're talking about cost of living adjustments. You're going to have to think about this money that you set aside. What is the assumed growth rate? What is the assumed growth rate? If you make very optimistic estimates of how well your investments will do, you can set aside less money. If you think that your money isn't going to do well investment-wise, you're going to have to set aside even more money."
Social Studies,"This is one of the cruxes of the issue, because you could imagine, let's say that we're talking at a state level, and people are, right now let's say that your current actuaries or statisticians are saying, ""Look, for this person, in order to guarantee them 60% of their salary when they retire,"" so that's $36,000, ""In order to guarantee that, we have to put aside ..."" and I'm just estimating these number right over here."
Social Studies,"Let's say we have to set aside $6,000 a year, especially when we're 30 years in advance. Actually, let me do a little more than that. Let's say $10,000 per year. Let's say that the person in charge, the state official, goes to those actuaries and say, ""What are you assuming about how much we're going to get on our investments here?"" The actuaries are saying, ""We're going to assume a fairly conservative."
Social Studies,"""We're going to assume that we're going to get 3% return on our money."" But then the state official says, ideally, they would want some of this $10,000 per year to spend on other things, and so they would like this to be lower. They say, ""That seems very conservative. ""In the last 10 years in the stock market, ""we've gotten 10% return,"" or, ""I know an ""endowment that's recently gotten 6% return."
Social Studies,"""Why don't we assume a higher return here? ""If we assume a higher return, ""why don't we assume a 5% return?"" All of a sudden, if we're assuming a 5% return, then we'll have to set aside less money that year. $8,000 a year."
Social Studies,"Sometimes, it's not even this, it's not even this playing with the assumptions, making more optimistic assumptions that allow you to spend less money in that current year, sometimes you might know that you have to spend $10,000 a year to kind of be able to properly fund these pensions in the future. You do have some type of unfunded pensions; but, in theory, a responsible party should try to fund these as much as possible."
Social Studies,"You might know that you have to fund $10,000 a year in order to credibly give this defined benefit for this employee 30 years in the future. But 30 years in the future is a long time. You have present difficuties; you have present shortfalls in your budget, and say, ""I recognize that I have to put $10,000 a year,"" but you still don't do that, so you underfund the pension. Even if you recognize this, or if you recognize this, you still only put $5,000 a year."
Social Studies,"Really just kind of kicking the can down the road, hoping that the next guy or gal who's in your position is going to figure out something; or maybe you'll just be very optimistic that the growth will turn out, or that the state will eventually work things out. What we'll see over the next video, this notion of underfunding pensions is a big, big, big, big problem because we've had decades of underfunded pensions, and it's been especially pronounced in particular states."
Social Studies,"Because of that, those states, in order to fund the pension obligations that are hitting now, those expenses for employees that are retired are starting to grow beyond their budgets for the employees that are working right now. It's a tough issue. You can't cut these things very easily. People expected these. These are retirees. These are people who've been working their whole life based on this assumption. But, at the same time, they're starting to squeeze out key services that the state is doing."
Social Studies,"It turns into a major, major hairy issue.."
Social Studies,"And what it shows is how funded the pension liabilities are in the different states. So for example-- actually, Texas, for example, 83% of their pension liabilities are funded. They've set aside 83% of the right amount of money to fund their pension obligations, not 100%. It is underfunded, but it's not crazy. California, pretty high, 78%. But one of these states is probably jumping out at you, probably because it has been shaded in red."
Social Studies,"And that is the state of Illinois, and Illinois is in trouble because it's only funded 45% of its pension obligations. And Illinois really jumps out because it's in red, but there's a lot of states that are pretty close to Illinois. Louisiana, 56%. Oklahoma, 56%. Kentucky, 54%. West Virginia, 58%. And this is an issue because they've set aside, in the past, very little money for the pension obligations that are starting to hit now, especially that you have a retiring baby boomer population."
Social Studies,"And in order to meet those obligations, those promised obligations, they're going to have to dig into money that was being spent other places, that going in the past when they were underfunding the pension, they were able to fund other things nicely, but not fund the pension and kind of kick the can down the road. But now that the can can't be kicked any further, it's going to have to go the other way around. You're going to have to take money from other things to fund your pensions."
Social Studies,"And to make it clear, let's focus on the state of Illinois. So this right over here. There's a couple of things going on. In this kind of yellow ochre color-- and I'll circle it in yellow ochre-- they were talking about the total liabilities. And just to make this graph clear, it's not just the yellow ochre part that's total liabilities. The entire height of each of these bars is the total liabilities, and you see how it has just completely blossomed here."
Social Studies,"And there's a lot of things that go into the total liabilities, the same things that we talked about in the last video. There are things like return on investment. If you are in a low interest rate environment, like we are now-- for example, my money in my savings account, I think, is getting like 0.4% interest. It's getting pretty much no interest."
Social Studies,"If you're in a low interest rate environment, if you're not getting good returns-- and a lot of pensions tend to go into very safe assets, but those are getting very low returns. You're going to have to set aside more money, and so you see these obligations essentially just growing dramatically. On top of that, you have things like cost of living adjustments. These are attempts at kind of factoring in inflation, how much things are costing in that region. But they are also sometimes negotiated."
Social Studies,"And sometimes, and especially in the case of Illinois, they've grown faster than the rate of inflation. And so you have these liabilities, and you see that they're getting less and less well funded. So if we go right over here, this is what this green line is, the funding ratio. So how well funded are these liabilities? Say the red part of the bar is the part that is not paid for. And the green is the ratio of the red or is the ratio of what is funded, essentially this higher part."
Social Studies,"It's the ratio of this part right over here to the entire bar. And you see right over here, Illinois is in a bad situation. Their total liabilities are 138 billion. This is in millions, so it's 138,000 million. So it's 138 billion. This is for one state. And 85 or 86 billion of that is unfunded, that they have to figure out some way to get the money because the right amount of money was not being set aside. And to do that, they're going to have to dig in into other things."
Social Studies,"So this right over here, this is the pension contribution. Let me circle this. So in this yellow color, once again, this is the pension contribution. And now the state, they're going to have to-- in order to get to a funded position, they're going to make up for all of the underfunding of the past and also the other factors that are making this obligation even larger. They're going to have to dig into other things."
Social Studies,"So you see right over here in yellow, these are the contributions that they're going to have to make for the pension. And you see that growing. It's growing to in excess by 2018 of $6 billion a year. But what's really fascinating about this graph is it's passing up total education funding in the state."
Social Studies,"So the cost of funding retirements for people who have already done service for the state but aren't in service to the state right now is going to pass up-- and this is happening very soon-- is going to pass up actual spending on a state-wide basis on education. And at the state level, education is a major, major, major expenditure. So it's going to be passing up a major expenditure, very important expenditure for the future of the state based on past obligations."
Social Studies,"And to understand where this is going-- and just to understand Illinois' situation, there's 750,000 Illinois-- I don't know how to say this-- Illinoians, Illinoisians, who are members of the state's five pension system. So this is the Teachers Retirement System. This is the State Universities Retirement System. This is the State Employees Retirement System. This is the Judges Retirement System. You see there's a lot fewer judges than that."
Social Studies,"There's many more teachers who've been retired, many who have been in the state universities. And this right over here is the General Assembly. Very few people who are in the Illinois state assembly. And you can see kind of comparable salaries. This is the retirement benefit, not just the salaries. This is how much on average these folks are getting once they retire on an annual basis. So you see that they're pretty reasonable, especially for the judges, although they are a small fraction."
Social Studies,"But in all fairness, this was promised to these people. They planned. The probably took lower compensation while they were working with the expectation that they would be able to get these benefits once they retired. They also probably stayed in the jobs longer. This is a way of retaining employees, because they knew that they were going to get this benefit. So you might say, oh, these are really, really great benefits."
Social Studies,"But at the same time, these people probably sacrificed other things in order to get these benefits now. But it's a very hard question. When you look at this, you say, well, these people, they've done service. They put these expectations. But at the same time, you're like, well, this is really cutting in-- and this is just one thing that I'm showing. It's really cutting into very important areas of investment for the entire state."
Social Studies,"So the whole reason of really just surfacing this, this whole pension issue, is just to put this in. And hopefully people understand what the issues are, because that's the only way that fairly hard decisions are going to have to be made, decisions on cutting necessary investment or restructuring or who knows what it might be. I don't envy the people who have to make these decisions.."
Social Studies,"So the first thing we talk with students a lot about is the FAFSA is a free form. You should not be paying for it. And the title again, it's by the federal government, they use a rubric to sort of figure out, based on this form, how much your family should contribute to a college education. Sal: And it's Free Application for Federal Student Aid? Sean: Student, yes, student aid."
Social Studies,"Sal: And just to hit the point home of what you just said, it should absolutely be free, and there are places where people will charge you to kind of optimize it, or fill it out for you, or... Sean: That's correct, so the first thing, normally when you start to type in on a search engine, FAFSA, a lot of times FAFSA.com pops up. It's a legitimate site, but they charge you something like 80, 85 dollars to help you fill out the form. So you want to go to FAFSA.ed.gov to start this process."
Social Studies,"Sal: .ed.gov, and there it will be free, and what is, when you fill out this form, in a future video we'll actually take a look at the form itself, but what do you input into it, and what comes out of it, and then who uses that information? Jim: I think for many students who are applying to college right now, they are accustomed to telling their story, in essays and in various pieces of their application, and they have to think of the FAFSA as just their family's financial story, and their financial story has many variables, but most importantly, the things that the FAFSA asks for are simplified as things that would be questions that students could probably answer right off the top of their head, in terms of their family income, and whether they own a home, or whether they rent where they live, it's things like that."
Social Studies,"Sal: And, I mean, I remember filling this, we were talking about this before, I guess clicking record, all of us were significant recipients of financial aid, of need-based financial aid, and I remember filling it out, I remember I kind of had my mom's tax form, which I had to fill out for her, right before filling out the FAFSA, Sean: Exactly (laughing) Sal: But that's essentially, I remember, at least this was in the early nineties, kind of the inputs that I needed to be able to fill out most of the form."
Social Studies,"Sean: And that's correct, yeah, I mean, one of the things that specifically looking at, in working with a lot of low-income families, one of the things to realize, is that it generally is actually a pretty simple form, because there aren't a lot of things that make it complicated. There aren't trust funds, there aren't investments, there aren't probably, in a lot of times, sometimes there are homes that are owned, but a lot of times they're just renting."
Social Studies,"Usually it's a paycheck that comes in, and it's sort of a standard paycheck that comes in for the year, so it's actually a pretty simple form, it's just getting students to step up and do it, is the real challenge."
Social Studies,"Sal: And the reason obviously, it's pretty obvious why they care about income, that's kind of the total amount of money your family's making, but then the reason why they care about things like home ownership, and if I remember properly, they ask things about the number of siblings you have, and they try to understand your family's expenses too, and the whole reason is to kind of figure out their ability to pay for college? Jim: That's right, so at the outset, students are asked questions to fill out on their family's financial circumstances, basically what the colleges are trying to do, is come to a conclusion, which allows them to have a picture of what the family is up against every month, every week, and what's left in the bank, so to speak, at the end of all the family operating expenses."
Social Studies,"Sal: And so what, after you fill out the form, where does that go, this is at the Department of Education site, but do they process it, or do they just give the form to the universities, what happens after that? Sean: That's a great point Sal, I think one of the misperceptions about the FAFSA is, I'm gonna submit this form to the government, basically, and then they're gonna crunch all these numbers, and then they're gonna determine a financial aid package for my family."
Social Studies,"I think that's a really common misperception. All the FAFSA does, is it looks again at your family's income, number of kids in the family, other assets, those sorts of things, and it determines an Estimated Family Contribution. What a college does with that varies greatly. And I think that's something that families need to understand. So all it is going to do is determine a number."
Social Studies,"That number might mean your family should be able to contribute 1000 dollars towards your son or daughter's education, 5000 dollars, or zero dollars for that matter, but that's all it does."
Social Studies,"Sal: I see, and the reason why this exists is so that colleges would have a somewhat uniform way of looking at this, and they can feel good that the data is real? Jim: That's right, and so one of the things in this Estimated Family Contribution is sort of this sense that the family is self-reporting where they stand in their family circumstances financially."
Social Studies,"And one of the things we want to caution about is that when you receive a sort of Estimated Family Contribution, or what they call the EFC, you want to make sure that's in line with your expectations, because sometimes that number can seem odd to the family when they understand where it came from, and they may have made a mistake in some way on the form."
Social Studies,"Sal: I see, but then that Estimated Family Contribution, then that gets sent to the universities that you have, usually at this point, have gotten admission to."
Social Studies,"Sean: It'll go to every university ahead of time, so if the student applies to seven schools, you're gonna want it there well before decisions come out, there are usually very strict deadlines to get things there in time, but then, usually what happens in the admissions office is if Sal, if I'm reading your application in the admissions office, and I say great, Sal Khan is gonna be admitted, and I call down to our financial aid office, this is all done electronically now, but the financial officer, what he will do is open up your electronic file, and he will see the FAFSA sitting in there, and then he will see that, and it will say, ok, the Khan family should be able to pay 1000 dollars towards Sal's education, we cost 50 thousand dollars, so now we're gonna have to create a financial aid package for 49 thousand dollars to make it possible for you to come here."
Social Studies,"Sal: And so that's before you've been officially admitted? Sean: It's typically when you get admitted, then the admissions office will say, ok now calculate a financial aid package."
Social Studies,"Sal: And are these, I can imagine a lot of students would worry about this, are these kind of separate processes, you know, or will the admissions officers be able to see the kind of Estimated Family Contribution, and then does that have the potential to kind of affect your chances of admissions? Jim: Oh absolutely, I think colleges are mindful of the programs that they have in place to support these students, and so the college's overall mission plays a role in how they're distributing financial aid, and the way they view students that they are going to support, through what they uncover in the FAFSA."
Social Studies,"Sean: And Sal, let me add to that, there's two important definitions here. One is institutions that are need blind, and institutions that are need sensitive. And that's an important question for students to ask as they are starting to research colleges. Typically need blind schools mean, whether or not you are applying for aid has no impact on an admissions decision. And, we will fund you to 100 percent of your demonstrated need, based on the FAFSA. Ok, so that's an important one."
Social Studies,"Needs sensitive, and this is getting to your point, there are schools, and again, the great majority of schools are need sensitive, because they have limited budgets, so they might take into account at some point in the process, financial aid."
Social Studies,"If we're sort of talking to really high-achieving, low-income students right now, typically they are still gonna make out very well, because even though the school might take into account need, and the student may need as much as a full ride, if they were really top, top students, that's still somebody they are going to support and probably pay for."
Social Studies,"If you are a student that's not as strong, that's when you might get caught in exactly what you are asking about, is though you need x number of dollars, you're sort of right in a range where we have a lot of choices, that may make you less attractive. So, again the story I always tell students is, the better student you are, not only the more opportunities you'll have for admission, but the better financial aid packages you'll be eligible for. Jim: That's right."
Social Studies,"Sal: And is it possible it might even go the other way, where when they look at your need, and they say wow, he or she comes from a family that didn't have all the resources of many of our other applicants, that that actually could be a positive, when you apply? Jim: Oh absolutely, I think the, for example Andover operates on a need blind admission initiative, and we're looking for students who meet the demands of our program, and when you see students who may not have had all the preparation in terms of leading up to coming to Andover, it's very compelling to find students who could manage the rigor of our program, and not have had that preparation, and so we would be very attracted to them, and want to provide a financial aid package that supports them at our school."
Social Studies,"Sal: Right. Jim: Colleges operate the same way. Sal: And Phillips Andover, obviously a well-recognized high school, and colleges, you're saying, are operating in a very similar way, or many do. Jim: Exactly, yes they do. Sal: Very cool.."
Social Studies,"Is this his presidential portrait? -  (laughing) I believe so, yes. So, Thomas Jefferson I think is really interesting because he didn't set out to found a party, -  Right. -  Although, he ended up doing so. It was more that he had a competing vision about what the United States should be that was different from the vision that was being promoted by some of the men who were in power early in the nation's history, like Washington, Adams, Alexander Hamilton."
Social Studies,"-  What is the difference between Jefferson and Hamilton's views on governance and how did this become the Democratic Party? -  Hamilton had an idea that he was going to try to make the government a little bit more centrist, so a strong central government, remember they've just switched to the constitution from the Articles of Confederation. -  What year was that? -  1787. -  Thank you."
Social Studies,"-  And Hamilton thinks that there needs to be a strong central government, a national bank, a kind of limited democracy, right? A democracy that is limited to more educated, landed men, and he wants the United States to be a lot like England. -  And Jefferson, and people who felt like Jefferson, like James Madison, were saying, woah, woah, woah, this is not what we rebelled against England for, to become England part two. -  Right."
Social Studies,"-  Instead what we should have is very expanded democracy, democracy for lots of people, doesn't matter their birth, and much more agrarian, state-focused, small government. -  And this is what we still call the Jeffersonian Ideal. -  Exactly, yeah. Small ""r"" republic citizens who are mainly farmers. Now, of course, the expanded democracy that Jefferson's thinking about doesn't apply to women or African Americans, Jefferson himself was a slaveholder."
Social Studies,"But he didn't want to limit governance to only the elite. -  So, the Jeffersonian Ideal is a republic for all landholding citizens. -  Exactly. -  But in 1800 the idea of what citizen meant was very limited and langered. -  So this doesn't really take root until the emergence of Andrew Jackson. In the late 1820's, he finally gets elected in 1832."
Social Studies,"So Jackson really pushes the idea of democracy for all white men to its farthest conclusion, which means that in this time period he expanded the franchise to any white man regardless of his property, which means that this was the most democracy in the history of the world up until this point. -  Yeah, but let me point out that you did say all white men. -  Exactly. So, Jackson is unabashedly a racist."
Social Studies,"And his vision of manifest destiny really involves the eradication of all Native Americans. -  I mean, this is a really dark time for American Indian policy. This is when we see something called the Indian Removal Act, that is literally what it's called. Jackson's presidency is also marked by the Cherokee Diaspora, the forced removal of the Cherokee along what's called the Trail of Tears. -  Yep. -  So, okay."
Social Studies,"So, before Jackson, do we really have the Democratic Party as an institution? -  No. Before this we would've called this the Anti-Federalists or the Democratic Republicans. -  Okay, so Hamilton is a Federalist position. Jefferson is an Anti-Federalist -  Right. -  So, okay. So we have these kicking around but they're not parties in the same way that we would see them now, they're just sort of policy positions? -  Yeah, I would say so."
Social Studies,"Having a mass political party was really an invention of the Jackson era. So, one did not run for president in the early 1800's, one stood for president as gentlemen around you talked of your virtues. It wasn't a campaign. -  Oh, so you couldn't actually campaign for yourself? -  Right, that was very uncouth. -  I see. -  So Jackson is the real antidote to this. He creates massive democracy."
Social Studies,"The turnout in this time period is 80, 90 percent, right? So everybody goes to vote. -  So, okay. So, let's talk about this political cartoon. -  Well, it's really just making fun of Andrew Jackson for being incredibly stubborn. He vetoed everything because the position of the Democratic Party, which is founded with Jackson, he vetoes everything because he believes in small government."
Social Studies,"So, he thinks that the power of the government should be negative, right? The less federal power, the better. Which is interesting for a president, right? -  Right. -  So it's in this time period, from probably this cartoon, that we get the image of the donkey as the iconic of the Democratic Party. -  Cool. -  Because Jack-son many believed was a Jack-ass. -  Ah."
Social Studies,"-  So the Democratic Party, as a party of all white men, ends up having a difficult relationship with slavery. Which is the major issue of 19th century America. And the issue of slavery really ends up kinda breaking the Democratic Party apart because in the election of 1860, they actually split into the Northern Democrats and the Southern Democrats and run two different candidates for president."
Social Studies,"-  Woah, why? I knew that the Whigs were split on slavery, what split the Democrats on slavery? -  Slavery, again. The Southern Democrats really supported the expansion of slavery everywhere. The Northern Democrats were just trying to prevent the Union from breaking up. -  So they were still pro-slavery, but pro-Union? -  Yes."
Social Studies,"-  And that's why they only carried Missouri? When it says Douglas here, is that Stephen Douglas? -  That is Stephen Douglas, famous foe of Abraham Lincoln. -  Dang. -  And Stephen Douglas actually died I think in 1861. -  Woah! -  Which was a real shock for the Democratic Party because they lost their real, major leader in the North."
Social Studies,"And so they are the minority party as Abraham Lincoln and the first Republican leads the United States to victory in the Civil War. And so having been kind of the opposition party against the victorious party in war means that the Democrats are in a fairly bad political position, really for most of the rest of the 19th century, right? 'Cause this is the real ascension era of the Republicans as they wave the bloody shirt. -  So the Republican party bled to save the Union. -  Exactly."
Social Studies,"-  Okay. -  So that's your bloody shirt. -  That's my bloody shirt. -  It's amazing. -  There it is. Little motion blur for you. (laughing) -  Of waving it, okay. I gotcha. -  So, okay. So this rhetorical strategy of saying, hey remember, the Republicans were the ones that saved the Union, that basically makes the Democrats a rump party, right? -  Yeah. For the rest of the 19th century."
Social Studies,"-  They're in bad shape. But they do have a few moments, especially in the late 19th century, there's a major economic depression. And remember, economic depression is never good for the party that's in power, right? -  Right. Is that here? -  So, in the panic of 1893, there's just major economic trouble. And in this time period, this is an important moment for the Democratic Party."
Social Studies,"-  Alright, so Kim, who's this fella? -  So this is William Jennings Bryan. -  Oh, I know him. -  And he's one of those guys who ran for president so many times but never actually won. So we don't-- -  Cross of Gold speech guy. -  Exactly, right. So he had this idea that the United States should move off the gold standard and instead allow silver as one of the currencies backing the U.S. dollar."
Social Studies,"And the idea behind this was that then the money would flood into the economy, and people would get wealthier, and it would end this depression. And that's not how it happened, but what it does do is moves the Democratic Party in a more populist direction, taking care of the smaller people who need more help financially. Right, so a more interventionist, economic policy. And so they want to kinda start helping the little guy with money. And you see this kind of in what we would call the Progressive Era."
Social Studies,"Which Wilson, who's gonna be the next Democratic president, starting in 1912, he's a big champion of Progressivism. And it's under Wilson's rule that the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote, is passed. So this is kind of anti-corruption, anti-monopoly, very pro trying to protect the consumer. So this is where the sort of more liberal aspect of Democratic monetary policy comes from. I don't wanna give the impression that Progressivism and Wilson were 100 percent good things."
Social Studies,"On one hand, Wilson was the first Southern president, he was a Virginian. Since the Civil War, after this era of waving the bloody shirt, and one of the things that Wilson does is he segregates federal jobs. So many African Americans who were working in the federal government were forced out under Wilson. -  And don't forget that Wilson is the president who screened the pro-KKK film, ""Birth of a Nation"" at the White House in 1915. -  Yeah."
Social Studies,"-  Alright, and then World War I happened, and then the stock market crash happened. -  Yeah, and the stock market crash happened under Republican rule, and it's never a good thing when your party's in power, and there's a major economic downturn. -  Right, and that's during the Hoover Administration. -  Exactly, before then. And so it's after this economic crash that Franklin Delano Roosevelt comes into power."
Social Studies,"And now Roosevelt has this very liberal approach to economics, right? And this is where sort of contemporary, modern American liberalism comes from, which is an idea that government should regulate the economy. You know, they shouldn't control the economy, but they should try to mediate some of these major swings that the economy could make. And also that government has a responsibility for the welfare of its people. So, FDR implements the New Deal."
Social Studies,"Which is a really sweeping set of social programs designed to try to get people out of their depression, and guarantee a certain standard of living for all Americans. -  What are some of those programs from the New Deal that we still have today? -  Social Security I think would be one of the biggest ones. That's a living wage for the elderly, or the disabled. And the FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which backs banks, for example."
Social Studies,"But what's interesting about this, is that we often think of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party kind of having opposite stances on things. But the Democratic Party in this time period kinda had a liberal Northern wing, and then a Southern conservative wing, so there are two kind of parts of the Democratic Party. -  Sure, so let's look at this map here, what is this Solid South thing? -  So this is the Solid South, and the Solid South is the Democratic, pro-Jim Crow South."
Social Studies,"So there's the Democratic Party in the South, which is much smaller government, really wanted to make sure that African Americans were prevented from having political power in the South. So it's interesting because African Americans after FDR really join the Democratic party, but in the South, most of them can't vote. -  Right. It's a very uncomfortable alliance. So, Kim, sorry, I thought that this part of the country, the Northeast, was still pretty solidly Republican at this time."
Social Studies,"-  I would say that FDR puts together kind of a New Deal Coalition of labor unions, ethnic and religious minorities, sort of the workers of the United States, who want a more interventionist government economy. -  Okay. -  But don't necessarily want the moralizing aspect that goes along with say, the Progressive Era, right? The Progressives passed prohibition, for example, right? They thought it was morally bad to drink."
Social Studies,"And one of the first things FDR does when he gets into office is to repeal prohibition saying, you know, what America needs now is a drink. Right? So it doesn't have this moral aspect, but it does have economic control. -  Okay."
Social Studies,"-  But the party continues to kinda move to the left on social issues, and in the mid 1960's, Lyndon Johnson start to pass civil rights legislation, like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and also pretty sweeping social programs, which are called the Great Society. So these is things like Head Start and lots of welfare programs. And in this time period, along with the Civil Rights Movement, you know, the Democratic Party really coalesces around this group in the North who are more pro-civil rights."
Social Studies,"So this period from FDR's election through Lyndon Johnson's administration is really kind of the Democratic heyday in the United States. Save for Eisenhower, there is no other Republican president that's elected during this time period, so this is 30 plus years of Democratic ascendancy. But it kinda comes apart in 1968. -  So what happens in 1968? -  Well, there's a lot of social unrest. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the assassination of Robert F."
Social Studies,"Kennedy, many summer riots. And many whites in the South who had, you know, followed this Democratic Coalition here, began to feel that the Civil Rights Movement and the commitment of the Democratic Party to civil rights had gone too far, basically. And there was the problem of Vietnam."
Social Studies,"The Vietnam War, which both parties were really strongly anti-Communist in this time period, so many of the sort of young people, who might otherwise have supported the Democratic Party, began to feel that the Democratic Party too was part of this war machine that was just sending the United States citizens to fight a war that they believed they had nothing to do with. -  So we're seeing this demographic shift. -  Exactly."
Social Studies,"So this Solid South, which had been voting Democratic because they had really complete political hegemony, right, 'cause African Americans couldn't vote, now that African Americans can vote, many of those whites end up switching to the Republican Party. -  Interesting. Alright, so Johnson decides he's not even gonna run again. -  Right. 'Cause he knows he can't win because the Vietnam War has just tarnished him in the sight of most Americans. -  Right."
Social Studies,"-  So, with the Democrats really split apart, in complete disarray, the Republicans take back the White House. -  So, okay. So Kim, that takes us up to about 1968 and the election of Nixon. And there's a lot of history of the Democratic Party. 216 years, right? -  Yep, it is the oldest, voter-based political party in the world. -  So, we can't fit the entire history into one video. -  No, there's too much."
Social Studies,"-  So, next time when we come back, we're gonna talk about the new Democrats under President Clinton, we're gonna talk about the Obama Administration, and the policy and the plank of the Democratic Party going forward. -  So stay tuned.."
Social Studies,"First, they had a line between North and South, said only slave states could be below this line. Now the Kansas-Nebraska Act overturns that compromise. The Kansas-Nebraska Act, which says that the citizens of a territory when applying for statehood can themselves decide whether or not that state should have slavery."
Social Studies,"-  So, even though Kansas and Nebraska are north of this parallel in Missouri above which slavery couldn't exist, this new law kind of overturns that, that agreement? -  Exactly."
Social Studies,"So a number of US citizens, who are anti-slavery, which means that they don't want slavery to spread into western territories, mainly because they want those territories free from white farmers to not have to compete with wealthy slaveholders who have free labor to farm and ship their goods and sell their crops. -  What about people that hate slavery and think it's immoral and want to abolish it? -  Those people are called abolitionists. -  Yeah, that's a convenient name."
Social Studies,"-  Yes. And the abolitionists, really before the 1850s they were kind of considered the lunatic fringe, only those sorts of people would imagine that you would want to end slavery right now everywhere that exists in the United States. So, they don't want to just not have slavery out in the West, they want slavery to be ended where it exists already in the South. -  Right."
Social Studies,"-  So, those who believed in abolition, those who believed in anti-slavery went to a new party, the Republican Party. -  So even within the Republican Party abolitionism was still on the fringe of the party plank? -  Yeah, I would say so. So, the new Republican Party which really comes out to an extremely strong start, they run their first candidate in 1856, he gets second place in national election, which is amazing. -  Not bad."
Social Studies,"-  But their second candidate for President is Abraham Lincoln. And Lincoln himself is actually kind of considered a moderate, because he is anti-slavery, he is not an abolitionist. But nonetheless, the South perceives Lincoln to be an abolitionist and white Southerners revolt and start the Civil War. -  So, because he is perceived as an abolitionist, because he is a Republican, that's why South Carolina secedes? -  Exactly. So, the Civil War ensues."
Social Studies,"This is a four year long battle. 620,000 Americans die. And at the end of the day, the North, the United States of America led by the Republican Party is victorious. -  So the victory of the United States in the Civil War kind of assures dominion of the Republican Party for a generation. -  Yeah, I would say even more than that. So, for the rest of the 19th century and really into the early 20th century the Republican Party is the stronger political party in the United States."
Social Studies,"-  So, from the end of the Civil War, from 1865, until about when would you say? -  I would say the Great Depression. -  So, it's an almost unbroken string of republican presidencies. -  Yeah, there are only three Democratic presidents in this time period. So it's 72 years of pretty much uninterrupted Republican rule. And the Republican Party is the party of anti-slavery. During the Civil War they were the party of the emancipation proclamation under Lincoln."
Social Studies,"So, it's during their rule that the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery, is passed. The 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal citizenship to African Americans, is passed. And the 15th Amendment, guaranteeing the right to vote for African Americans, is passed. -  So in the period immediately following the Civil War called Reconstruction, when we see the election of some of the first African American senators and representatives to the Congress. -  Exactly."
Social Studies,"So, during this time period quite a few African American men were elected to US Congress, and many more served in appointed roles, like postmaster. -  So this is when we get the election of Senator Hiram Revels from Mississippi. -  Exactly. So Hiram Revels was one of the first two African American senators. So after the Civil War the Republican Party was really kind of this party of the Gilded Age. They believed in modernizing the infrastructure of the United States."
Social Studies,"They built lots of railroads. They enacted policies that would protect American business. And it's really in this early period of the turn of the century that the Republican Party becomes associated with protections of business there. -  Is that what the elephant's about? -  Kind of, yes. So, the elephant was popularized in an 1870 cartoon by Thomas Nast. -  Oh, the same guy that gave us Santa Claus, right? -  Yes."
Social Studies,"And Nast depicted the Republican Party as an elephant because it was a party of strength, a really big consequential party. -  That's so fascinating to have gone from this, like, insurgency party to this, like, to being perceived as the elephant of electoral politics in 30 years. -  Yeah, it's amazing. Unfortunately, it kinda all comes crashing down with the Great Depression. -  Sure."
Social Studies,"-  So, the pro-business policies, the lack of regulation in the 1920s leads to the stock market crash of 1929. And it was a Republican president, Herbert Hoover, who was in the presidency at the time of the crash. And so, in 1932, Democrat Franklin Roosevelt is elected president. And the following 40 years, more or less, are going to be the time of Democratic ascendancy. But, in the meantime, there is one notable Republican president. -  Ike for President, Ike for President."
Social Studies,"-  I like Ike, you like Ike, Everybody likes Ike. -  For President. -  (laughs) So, we were quoting one of Ike's campaign commercials. -  Who is Ike, Kim? -  Ike was General Dwight Eisenhower who was a World War II hero. He was so popular he would have been elected had his... -  Could have been from the Martian party, right? -  Yes (laughs)."
Social Studies,"-  Like any party expect the Communist Party would have propelled Eisenhower to the presidency. -  Yes. Exactly. And you're right that one of the, you know, key themes of this time period was anti-Communism, and both Republicans and Democrats had an anti-Communist bent. But Eisenhower was elected in 1952, and he was really the first president to use commercial spots to get elected. He had these cute little jingles that were very memorable. -  So catchy."
Social Studies,"-  And he really used the medium of television well. So he's kind of the father of TV ads. -  Yeah, it's interesting, because I think we think of Kennedy as being the first television president. But I would, I think we could both make the claim that it's, it's really Eisenhower. -  That is a great point. So, Eisenhower is kind of a Republican moment in a much larger Democratic era. -  Okay. -  And this is the era when the Civil Rights Movement happens."
Social Studies,"This is the era of the Great Society programs, which were Lyndon Johnson's programs to try to attack poverty, and New Deal programs. So this is really the birth of the welfare state. So in this time period the Republicans begin to experience a demographic shift. So first, they had been the party that was most known for representing African Americans, because they were the party of Lincoln."
Social Studies,"But during the New Deal, when most people really needed economic help, the African American constituency moved over to the Democrats. They actually had a campaign saying to African Americans ""turn your picture of Abraham Lincoln to the wall"" so that he can't see you changed parties. But this is really the time period when the Democratic Party begins to pick up the votes of African Americans."
Social Studies,"And so, over the course of the 1930s through the 1960s, as the Democratic Party begins to advocate bigger and bigger government, a larger welfare state, and more and more social progress, the Republicans develop a conservative response to that. And in the 1970s and 1980s, in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement, many whites in the South felt that the social chaos of the Civil Rights Movement had gone too far."
Social Studies,"And so, they left the Democratic Party, which had been traditionally a party in the South, and joined the Republican Party, which was presenting a more conservative face towards social change. And so, in the 1980s this new conservative movement really came together in the person of Ronald Reagan. And Ronald Reagan brought together a number of constituencies. He brought together business interests, who wanted less government regulation of business."
Social Studies,"He also brought together Christian evangelicals, who wanted a more conservative social value program in government. And he also brought together anti-Communists, who felt that the Democratic presidents had been too soft on Communism during their tenure. -  So this is interesting to me, because it seems to be around the era of Reagan that we started to see the beginnings of ideological polarization within the parties."
Social Studies,"-  I would say that's kind of been around since the beginning, more or less. You know, the two original political parties in the United States, the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists, or the Democratic-Republicans. This is the party led by Thomas Jefferson versus the party led by Alexander Hamilton. You know, they had the same idea of the sort of large central government versus the small central government."
Social Studies,"In many ways we're still debating the same issues that Hamilton and Jefferson were debating in 1800. -  So, okay, so we're seeing this conservative coalition coalesce around the election of Reagan, and his election was like a sweep, right? -  Yes. Yeah, he deregulates a lot of industries. He defends conservative social family values, like prayer in school, for example. And he takes a very hard line against Communism. And George W."
Social Studies,"Bush, who was the most recent Republican president, had a fairly similar agenda, although less emphasis on anti-Communism and instead an emphasis on anti-terrorism. -  So we're seeing this shift over last 150 years of party priorities for the Republicans as the country changes and as its demographics change. -  And we'll find out how the story of the Republican Party continues in this election.."
Social Studies,"Why did they, what's special about that? - [Jeffrey] Well, when the Constitution was drafted, it wasn't obvious we'd have a single executive under the Articles of Confederation, all the state governors, some of them had plural executives."
Social Studies,"Alexander Hamilton at the Constitutional Convention was proposing a kind of monarchy, a President for Life, so the idea of setting out limited powers for the presidency and specifying what they were, creating a President that was energetic enough to achieve common purposes but restrained enough not to be a tyrant was a huge achievement for the Constitution."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] That under the Articles of Confederation there wasn't a proper executive branch, it was really the President presided, so to speak, over Congress. - [Jeffrey] That's right and each, you needed unanimous consent to get anything done, which is why the Confederate Congress couldn't raise money to support the war efforts and couldn't raise taxes. So the framers came to Philadelphia to create an energetic executive but one that was also restrained and that's why the vesting power is so important."
Social Studies,"It basically says that the, all executive power is vested in the President but that power is not unlimited. Now, people have disagreed about how much power the vesting power grants. Theodore Roosevelt had this stewardship theory that the President can do anything that's not forbidden by the Constitution and Article Two. William Howard Taft, who came after Roosevelt, had the opposite theory, a kind of judicial theory of the President. He said the President can only do what isn't forbidden."
Social Studies,"So the question of whether Article Two is the exclusive series of presidential powers or whether there are other implicit powers is a debate that continues to this day. - [Sal] This will be fascinating. We'll go into much more depth in future videos. And just going through the rest of Section One, it looks like there's a lot of the mechanics of what does it mean to have a term of office. What the, how you become President."
Social Studies,"Is that essentially Section One? You see this first part, he shall hold his office during the term of four years and together with the Vice President, chose for the same term, be elected as follows. And then they kind of go into the electoral college system. - [Jeffrey] Exactly, and then there are a couple other requirements. No person except a natural born citizen can be President and we know that term was subject to some debate during the recent presidential election."
Social Studies,"And then there's the provision that says that Presidents have to 35 years old, it's the most explicit part of the Constitution and the point was to prevent aristocratic scions without a lot of experience from taking office. The framers were really concerned about having new monarchies and they wanted to make sure that Presidents were seasoned enough so that's why you can't be President unless you're 35. - [Sal] Fascinating."
Social Studies,"And as we go further, and I've copied this text from your website, from the National Constitution Center and why did you all highlight some of this text of Article Two in this yellow-orange color? - [Jeffrey] Well, we're really thrilled by this website, we're excited to be doing a series of videos with you, Sal, and it's the interactive Constitution, folks can find it at constitutioncenter.org."
Social Studies,"These are the main clauses where we commission the top liberal and conservative scholars to write about what they agreed and disagreed about these clauses. So in Section One of Article Two, the main clause is the vesting clause and that's the one to focus on. The other stuff, as you said, is basically just requirements of what you have to be in order to be President. And then we highlighted other important provisions in Sections Two, Three, and Four."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Yep and in particular this section on the electoral college system, this was superseded, I saw, I learned from your website, by the 12th Amendment. Is that because of what happened with Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson? - [Jeffrey] Yes, we know that from the musical Hamilton, the election of 1800 did not end well."
Social Studies,"There was actually a tie in the House and so it went into the electoral college and Aaron, rather a tie in the electoral college, it went to the House and Alexander Hamilton cast his support for Jefferson over Burr and Burr was so furious about that that he challenged Hamilton to the duel that ultimately killed him."
Social Studies,"But the peculiarity of having the original system where the first place winner in the electoral college became President and the second place winner became Vice President was so unwieldy that provision of the Constitution was amended and now, as we know, Presidents and vice Presidents run on a single ticket. - [Sal] Yup, yup."
Social Studies,"And the rest of Section One, it kind of finishes off with, in the case of the removal of the President, his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers, it talks about how Congress can provide for who should be President next. - [Jeffrey] Exactly, so, and there are statutes that provide that and Congress has an elaborate rule of succession that it's created as empowered by this part of the Constitution."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Yep, and then the last two pieces here, it talks about just the compensation of the President, cannot be increased or diminished during the period for which he shall be elected, maybe to prevent him from giving himself a raise or herself from giving herself a raise and then the last is just the famous oath of office."
Social Studies,"I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States and will do to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. - [Jeffrey] Sal, you did a great job, although there was an extra do in there and I'm pointing that out because you remember when Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath to President Obama. The fact that he slightly bungled it led Roberts, just to be safe, to re-administer the oath."
Social Studies,"So, if you want, I can do it again and maybe you'll be President. - [Sal] Sounds good. So then we get into Section Two which is, I think, maybe, gets a little bit more involved. This first paragraph here, it says the President shall be the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States and clearly they don't say all of the different forces of the United States because we didn't have an Air Force then. - [Jeffrey] Yes. - [Sal] Or Marines."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] We sure didn't, but there was a concern about the king controlling the military, so the two main purposes of this Commander in Chief clause are, first, total civilian control of the military and second, the idea that there's just a single leader. So the military is subordinate to civilian and democratically accountable control and unlike the Articles of Confederation, a single person gets to control all of this power so that you can have a coordinated military force."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] And as simple and as clean as this statement seems to be, in future videos we'll discuss more of how this may or may not be in contention with the power given to Congress in Article One around the right to declare war. - [Jeffrey] Exactly right, we know that the President in Section Two has the power to, Congress has the power to declare war and the question of what the President can do is contested, as you said."
Social Studies,"We'll talk about it more later but everyone agrees that the President has the ability to repel sudden attacks. At the same time, we haven't had a declared war since World War Two, although there's been lots of military actions and the question of how much independent power the President has to initiate military action is very hotly contested."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Yep, and in this next section, this talks about the power of the President to make treaties but with the advice and consent of the Senate and it has to be approved, provided two thirds of the senators present concur."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] Yes, so the treaty power is shared between the President and the Senate, and generally people think that the Senate can approve or disapprove or maybe attach conditions or reservations to the treaty but the President, alone, has the power to negotiate treaties and that was a precedent set by George Washington. So the treaty power is shared."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] And there's a lot here cause it also talks about the power of the President to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and other officers of the United States. So this is a pretty important sentence there. - [Jeffrey] It sure is. We know now from the controversy over Supreme Court nominations that the so-called advice and consent clause is really important. The advice and consent clause is limited to high officers as opposed to inferior officers."
Social Studies,"Because the clause says for inferior officers, Congress can vest the appointment in the President alone, in the courts of law or the heads of the department. But for high ranking officials like Supreme Court judges, the President can nominate, the Senate exercises advice and consent and this is a shared power between the President and Congress."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Yes, and just to make people familiar with the language, when they're talking about inferior officers, they're not making any judgment about those peoples capability, they're more talking about a more junior, less senior officials in the government. - [Jeffrey] That's an excellent point but although it is a term of art, it's hugely important and people have disputed about who counts as an inferior officer cause a lot hangs on it."
Social Studies,"If the officer isn't inferior then the President alone doesn't get to appoint them. - [Sal] And then they-- - [Jeffrey] Sorry, and also the question of who the President can remove or fire without Congressional approval is important and may hinge on that question as well. - [Sal] Right, and we'll talk more about it, but it seems like, you need Senate consent for more of the getting people into their jobs but being able to remove them is oftentimes, there's more power there for the President."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] Absolutely, although again, like most of these powers, they're contested, there are arguments on both sides throughout history and the Supreme Court has both recognized the President's unitary authority to fire executive branch officials but in other cases have said that Congress can impose certain conditions on when the President can fire someone."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] And somewhere we'll talk about it more but this next sentence, really, is also a really interesting one is that look, when the Senate is in recess, the power shall have the President, the President shall have the power to fill up all vacancies and it seems like it's a temporary filling of positions by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] That's exactly right and the President's power to make recess appointments was just litigated before the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court unanimously that President Obama could not make certain appointments because Congress wasn't technically out of session, so the question of when the Senate is in recess is very contested and the scope of that power is really important as well."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] And Section Three, it kind of just says, hey, the President can get Congress together for the State of the Union, can address Congress, can kind of tell Congress what's on his or her mind. - [Jeffrey] Yes. It does say that and the State of the Union power is really important. You know, there's one other clause in Section Two that just might want to flag and that's the take care clause. Sorry, that's in Section Three and I know you're about to get to it."
Social Studies,"So we start with this ability to give Congress information about the State of the Union, the ability to convene both Houses of Congress in cases of disagreement among them. Then you get to this really core power, that he shall take care of the laws we faithfully executed."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] And why is that so important that he takes care of the laws? I mean, isn't that what the executive should be doing? - [Jeffrey] Absolutely, but there's a serious question, what happens if the President believe a law is unconstitutional, then is it the kind of law that he has to execute? And President Thomas Jefferson said no, he refused to enforce the Sedition Acts which basically allowed the government to punish people who criticized the President on the grounds that Jefferson believed that it was unconstitutional."
Social Studies,"More recently, we've had a big controversy over this clause when opponents of President Obama's executive orders about immigration have said that they're a violation of his power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed because, according to opponents, Congress reached a different immigration policy. The Supreme Court ultimately refused to cleanly decide that because of the four four split and it didn't clearly rule on the question of the take care clause and the immigration policy."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Fascinating. And just to finish up here and we'll go deeper in future videos as we go into Section Four, this really just talks about how the President or the Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, how they might be removed from office. - [Jeffrey] That's right and we know from not so distant history that the only way the President can be removed from office is by impeachment. A President is impeached by the House and has to be convicted by Senate."
Social Studies,"Two Presidents have been impeached in American history, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Neither has been convicted so we've never actually had a President who's been removed from office under the impeachment clause. - [Sal] And a lot of times in popular language, impeachment, to be clear, impeachment is the accusation and then you have to be held at, no you actually did, those crimes happened and that's what you're saying, the Senate is responsible for it."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] That's right, you can be impeached but acquitted and that's what happened to both Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson so it's like being indicted but then you go to trial and you're later acquitted, you get to keep your office. - [Sal] Well thanks so much, Jeffrey, this is a super valuable overview. - [Jeffrey] Thanks, it's been great to talk.."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] It is. Article One, defining the powers of Congress is much longer. The Framers were much more concerned about tyranny in Congress than tyranny in the Executive, and because there is so much wiggle room in Article Two, presidential practice has been really important, and obviously the most important president in establishing that practice was our first president, George Washington."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] This is this idea that because it was short it left out a lot of what a president maybe could do or could not do and that's why our first president, the precedent that he set was really important for how people perceived the powers of the President."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] Yes, it's a nice homonym, he was a both a president and set this important precedent and because the Framers knew that Washington was gonna be the first president, he takes office in 1789, right when the Constitution is ratified, they trusted him to establish these precedents which have been followed to this day. - [Sal] And just a little bit of historical context, in 1776 is the official founding of the country, the Declaration of Independence, the official start of the Revolutionary War."
Social Studies,"Although I'm sure you have skirmishes before that. Then we have the Articles of Confederation that get ratified in 1781. It was deemed that it was too weak, essentially of a confederation and then our Constitution gets ratified 1789, same year that Washington takes office as our first president. - [Jeffrey] Exactly right. As soon as he takes office, Washington faces this dilemma that's not answered by the Constitution."
Social Studies,"And that's does he recognize the French Revolution who have just killed and guillotined Louis XIV. So Washington has these three choices, he can stand by the monarchy and condemn the Revolution, he can recognize the French Revolutionaries as the rightful government or he can say it's not my choice and all of our former treaties are void."
Social Studies,"He consults his cabinet, decides to recognize the Revolutionaries and that establishes the precedent that Presidents now have unilateral power to recognize or de-recognize foreign governments. - [Sal] And that's interesting 'cause when we're looking at Section Two which at least talks something about treaties, it says that the President can make treaties, I'll underline this. The President can make treaties provided two thirds of the Senators present concur."
Social Studies,"It talks about ambassadors but it doesn't talk about the recognition of foreign countries. And as you point out the French Revolution, things started in 1789, as you get into the early 90's the Revolution continues and Washington says well, do we recognize the government of Louis the XVI that helped America during the French Revolution or do we recognize the Revolutionaries who seem to have a lot more in common with us in terms of their principles around government, at least of the stated ones."
Social Studies,"And he decides that well, it's not written in the Constitution here but as President, I can make that decision to recongize the Revolutionaries. - [Jeffrey] Absolutely. That leads to another series of important questions which you just flagged, who exactly gets to negotiate the treaties. And Washington has, soon after the French Revolutionary recognition, he wants to negotiate a treaty with Britain, it's called the Jay Treaty."
Social Studies,"So he secretly sends Gouverneur Morris, who's the Framer who is most responsible for drafting the Preamble to the Constitution, as an unofficial emissary or negotiator to Britain and they negotiate the treaty and then Washington designates John Jay as the envoy. The Senate doesn't endorse the diplomatic mission, Jay is getting his orders straight from Washington. After the deal is reached, then Congress, after the fact, approves of Washington's diplomatic entrepreneurship."
Social Studies,"So this establishes the really important precedent that the President can send emissaries to negotiate treaties which are approved by Congress after the fact, and that precedent is seized on by President Thomas Jefferson who negotiated for the really important purchase of the Louisiana Territory on the spot without Congressional approval and gets Senate approval after the fact."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Famously negotiated with Napoleon Bonaparte because he frankly, his navy had been destroyed at Trafalgar so he was in no position to protect something halfway across the world (laughing)."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] And this drove Jefferson's critics crazy 'cause Jefferson is this big proponent, before he becomes President, of limited Presidential authority and he becomes President and he seems to expand it by seizing on this treaty negotiation power that isn't explicitly in the Constitution and hugely increases the landmass of the United States."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] And the importance of these precedents, just to go back to Section Two, it does say, ""He shall have power by and with the advice ""and consent of the Senate to make treaties, ""provided two thirds of the Senators present concur."" And your point is that the way it's written in Section Two, it's not clear whether you need the advice and consent beforehand or whether they just kind of approve after the fact."
Social Studies,"Washington, his term was from 1789 until 1797, he assumed that no, I should be able to go and very nimbly negotiate these things without having to involve the entire Senate. And once it's negotiated I need to go to them and get them to approve it. Jefferson, who was in power from 1801 to 1809, kind of further reinforced that precedent, said hey, I'm just gonna negotiate this thing and then get it approved."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] That's exactly right and that allows Jefferson, when he gets approval for the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, to get the Senate to approve the treaty and to persuade the House to finance the legal structure for the new territory. He probably couldn't have done that if he hadn't worked out the negotiating details in advance. - [Sal] Another element that the second paragraph here of Section Two talks about is, with the advice and consent of the Senate, this is talked about a lot."
Social Studies,"The Constitution tries to set up the Senate as where the President goes to test his ideas, get some thinking. But Washington also decides that well, it's not that efficient to talking to all these elected officials, maybe I'll set my own body that I talk to more frequently. - [Jeffrey] That's exactly right. As we talked about before, Section Three of the Constitution seems to say that the President can consult Congress for advice in all sorts of situations. He can convene both houses."
Social Studies,"He can adjourn them and so forth, but Washington established this precedent of using a cabinet, and that's a term that doesn't appear anywhere in the Constitution. Despite the part of the Constitution that also allows the President to seek the opinions of the various officers, Washington informally sought his cabinet's advice. And today although the cabinet meets less frequently than it did before, the Presidential Cabinet or Cabinet meetings is established as a precedent in the Executive Branch."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] The last piece that this Section Two also talks about the ability of the President to make appointments, anything from ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, judges, Supreme Court, and other officers of the United States and it also talks about Inferior Officers which are more junior officers that some Presidents can do that without getting approved by Congress. This is also up for some interpretation and Washington's precedent's important there as well."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] It is, Washington was very frustrated by the Senate and basically decided to cut it out and not to seek advice and consent in person. One account says that when he left the Senate Chamber, he said he'd be damned if he ever went there again. He didn't seek the Senate's written advice before making big decisions like treaty negotiations and he just preferred to consult the Cabinet. That Cabinet had huge and important disagreements."
Social Studies,"Again we know from the musical Hamilton, Hamilton and Jefferson disagree about the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States, they both give their opinions, Washington listens to both and he sides with Hamilton over Jefferson and decides to bless the constitutionality of the bank, he got that from his Cabinet and not from Congress."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] And then finally in this appointment, to what degree can the President unilaterally take people out of their jobs, fire people, that is also left to interpretation. - [Jeffrey] That's right, Washington established the ability for President unilaterally to fire executive officers or executive department heads."
Social Studies,"Since the Senate textually has the power to hire department heads, you could have read Article Two to allow it to have a mirror role in firing them as well but the Supreme Court blessed this idea that the President can dismiss people on his own, there was an important case called Meyers Against United States which said that the Vesting Clause which we talked about earlier gave the President both the authority to execute the law and to remove executive officials."
Social Studies,"There are other cases like the Humphrey's Executor case from 1935 which said that Congress could limit the President's ability to remove certain commissioners. But the broad precedent that Washington established is that the President's unitary authority allows him alone to fire Executive Branch officials. - [Sal] Fascinating, well thanks so much Jeffrey, this is super valuable. - [Jeffrey] Thanks, great to talk.."
Social Studies,"How do these two things fit together, Jeffrey? - [Jeffrey] Well, they've led to the most dramatic constitutional controversies in American history as Justice Robert Jackson put it in the Steel Seizure case. These cryptic words of the commander-in-chief clause have given rise to some of the most persistent controversies in our constitutional history. Everyone agrees that congress has the power to declare war and once war is declared, the president has total control over the conduct of the war."
Social Studies,"There's civilian control of the military, there's a single leader once the war starts but how the president can act to deploy the troops in the face of emergencies when congress is silent, and how much congress can constrain its power has led rise to some huge constitutional controversies. - [Host] And the Steel Seizure case that you talked about, this was in 1952, this was arguably talking about the Korean War."
Social Studies,"What was the context there? Why did this need to be ruled on? - [Jeffrey] Well, it's an amazing case and the steel companies are gonna go on strike, and President Truman decides this is a threat to national security because the army needs steel to conduct the Korean War. He decides on his own without congressional authorization to seize the steel mills as part of his authority, his military authority as commander-in-chief and this goes up to the supreme court and the supreme court strikes him down."
Social Studies,"They say he can't seize the steel mills on his own. Truman is shocked, he's appointed many of the justices but the most influential opinion in the steel seizure case is the concurring opinion by Justice Robert Jackson, and I want our listeners to go check it out on the web because it's so important. And Justice Jackson identified three categories of executive power that every law student learns and they're easy to remember."
Social Studies,"Basically, when the president acts with congressional approval, his authority is at its height. When he acts in the face of congressional disapproval, his authority as at its lowest ebb. And when congress has neither approved or disapproved, the president acts in a zone of twilight, as Justice Jackson said. It sounds like the Twilight Zone and I always think of that music."
Social Studies,"(mumbles) But it means that in the Steel Seizure case, although the congress had not authorized the seizure and the president had no civilian authority to seize the steel mill, so he had no independent authority to rely on them in the zone of twilight, and therefore, the court held he acted unconstitutionally. - [Host] And Truman's argument might have been hey, look the constitution makes me the commander-in-chief. If I read that broadly I should be able to do whatever I need to execute in times of war."
Social Studies,"Steel is a very important input into making the things that you need to execute your war with. And so, if they're gonna go on strike, that's gonna keep me from being able to conduct our war. - [Jeffrey] That's exactly right."
Social Studies,"That's just what he argued and although some justices bought it including Chief Justice Fred Vinson who Truman had appointed, a majority of the supreme court said that civilian power over the military doesn't authorize the president to use his power in the United States in ways that might be helpful to the war effort. He needs explicit congressional approval for that. It really upset President Truman. He invited the whole supreme court."
Social Studies,"They actually invited him for drinks at Justice Hugo Black's house after the decision came down, and Truman sulked for a while and he said, ""Hugo, I don't think much of your law ""but my golly, this bourbon is good."" So they kind of, (laughs) they made up after the case. (laughs) - [Host] And another I guess relevant, this isn't a case but a resolution, is War Powers Resolution 1973, historical context. We're nearing the end of the Vietnam War."
Social Studies,"What was the background there? - [Jeffrey] Well, congress was very upset that President Nixon had sent bombers into Cambodia without congressional approval, and there'd been other disputes about the president's power in Vietnam. Congress decided to try to codify exactly when the president could act to repel sudden attacks, which everyone agrees that he has the right to do."
Social Studies,"So, congress said, ""President, you've got to notify us ""within 48 hours of the time ""that you send troops on your own ""and you can only keep those troops ""on the ground for 30 days, ""except under extraordinary circumstances, ""otherwise you need congressional approval."" Despite this effort to kind of set out congressional approval for these extraordinary situations, some presidents have argued that the War Powers Resolution itself is unconstitutional as a violation of the president's commander-in-chief power."
Social Studies,"Others on the other side they said congress is sitting too much power to the president but so far the supreme court has not struck down the War Powers Resolution, and presidents are supposed to abide by it, although sometimes they haven't. President Bill Clinton sent troops into Kosovo without following the War Powers Resolution and notifying congress."
Social Studies,"- [Host] What's the argument that a president would make that the war powers or anyone could make, that the War Powers Resolution is unconstitutional? That somehow conflicts with section two."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffrey] The argument is that the president's unitary authority under Article II gives him complete power as commander-in-chief to conduct military operations as he thinks best, and that includes the ability to send troops into the field despite the explicit provision in Article I, section eight of the constitution that says the congress has the power to declare war. The unitary executive people and President George W."
Social Studies,"Bush's administration claim this explicitly say that the president basically can do whatever he thinks is necessary to preserve national security. That led after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 other presidents including President Obama said that because of the commander-in-chief clause, various attempts by congress to limit the president's unitary authority were unconstitutional and the Bush administration said the forbidding of torture of detainees, warrantless surveillance, the detention of U.S."
Social Studies,"citizens as enemy combatants, all of these were unconstitutional. The supreme court rejected many of those claims including most famously in the Hamdan and Rumsfeld case in 2006 where the court said that the president could not set up military tribunals without congressional authorization. The big lesson from all these cases is that when the president acts side by side with congress, then the supreme court tends to uphold executive power."
Social Studies,"But when this president acts unilaterally on his own especially in the face of congressional disapproval, the supreme court is likely to slap him down. - [Host] But across all of these, there is a, even though these cases especially the ones we cite seem to limit presidential authority to some degree. There is this general notion even our founding fathers thought of which is yes, the congress has the power to declare war but as the commander-in-chief, what if we're suddenly attacked by someone."
Social Studies,"Obviously, you don't wanna go through the process of getting all the congressmen together and to vote, you need to be able to act quickly. It has always been understood that as commander-in-chief, the president could engage in conflict quite quickly. - [Jeffrey] No question about it and presidents have done so from the beginning, the response to 9/11 is a famous example as well."
Social Studies,"But many of the framers thought that congress' approval was necessary for serious wars, the war of 1812 there was a former declaration but there were lesser uses of force like the war with France in 1798, conflict with the Barbary states in Tripoli and Algeria, conflict with Native American tribes. All of these are approved by congress although without formal declarations. In the modern era though, things have really changed and presidents have used military force without expressed consent from congress."
Social Studies,"On lots of occasions, the Korean War, Libya, Grenada, Lebanon, Panama, Noriega, all of these are cases where the president has used this force without congressional authorization. And we haven't had a formal declaration of war since World War II. - [Host] I mean, that statement I think is worth writing down that's why I-- (laughs) - [Jeffrey] Okay, Let's write it down. - [Host] Since World War II."
Social Studies,"I mean, when I, when you say that to me it's like well, what's, it kind of feels like well, we've clearly had what you and I would consider wars since World War II, Korea, Vietnam War, obviously post 9/11 what happened in Afghanistan. We have the Iraq war, actually we have both the Iraq wars. And you've had all sorts of military action whether we're talking about drone strikes or kind of very surgical interventions and all of those were done without a formal declaration of war by congress."
Social Studies,"So, to what degree does this even matter anymore? It seems like in modern times, presidents are able to do what they need to do militarily. - [Jeffrey] Well, that seems right. Now, that's not to say congress hasn't acted. Many of the wars we've talked about have had informal statutory authorization including most famously recently, the authorization of the use of military force after 9/11 which was said to authorize a lot of what happened after 9/11."
Social Studies,"And it's now contested whether that continues to authorize the war not against Al-Qaeda which it was originally passed for, but also against ISIS. But it certainly seems to be the case that formal declarations of war have now been replaced with these more informal authorizations or even with presidential unilateral action."
Social Studies,"- [Host] And I guess, maybe one argument there is that in some of these wars, it gives more flexibility to the president to be flexible and there might not even be a state to declare war against. - [Jeffrey] That's true although there have been a bunch of these wars where there are clear states. Korea, Libya, Grenada, Lebanon. More literalist conceptions of the president say the president could have and should have asked for formal declarations of war, but that's not the way that the modern executive want."
Social Studies,"- [Host] Fascinating. Well, thanks so much Jeffrey. This is really informative. - [Jeffrey] Thanks. A pleasure to talk.."
Social Studies,"- [Presenter] What do you mean by the president today is twice as powerful as Congress? - [Jeffery] Well, I guess that was a hypothesis, but it's arguable that, having assumed powers to deploy troops without congressional authorization to target and kill American citizens abroad, to engage in Executive orders without congressional approval, critics of the expansion of presidential power say that the president has usurped congressional authority, he's exceeded his power under the Take Care Clause of Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution and that in this way, presidential authority has hugely expanded while congressional authority has contracted."
Social Studies,"- [Presenter] I see. And what are, I mean, what are the dynamics that allowed this to happen over the last several hundred years? - [Jeffery] Well, there's a wonderful essay on the National Constitution Center's Interactive Constitution by William Marshall and it's, you can find it if you click on Article II, Section 3, and William Marshall is trying to figure out what some of these dynamics were, and he comes up with a bunch of reasons why the president has been so dominant."
Social Studies,"First, he says political culture, the president has become the focus of national power and culture in a way that he wasn't in a pre-internet, pre-television, pre-radio age, and this was the case even during World War II when Justice Jackson Steel Seizure Case that we talked about before, talk about Executive power having the advantage of concentration in a single head in who's choice a whole nation has a part, making him a focus of public hopes and expectations."
Social Studies,"But there's no question that the focus on the individual person of the presidency has vastly expanded. - [Presenter] It's just this idea that there's one person there, people associate that person, hey, they're our Head of State, they put their hopes and fears on that person and that just gives them inherently more power."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffery] It does and you can call it culture, you can call it celebrity, but it's so striking that the Framers are so concerned that the president not be a king and they reject Alexander Hamilton's suggestion, which again (chuckles) we know from the musical, that the president be elected for life."
Social Studies,"They wanna have four year terms and then the, subsequently, a Constitutional amendment is passed, the 22nd Amendment, to limit the president to only two terms, and despite all that, the presidency has expanded so much. It's not only the political culture. Marshall points to a bunch of other reasons. Executive branch precedence, basically every president has been successful in asserting increasingly sweeping exercises of executive power. This is a bipartisan phenomenon from President Clinton to George W."
Social Studies,"Bush, to President Obama, the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department has authorized increasingly sweeping exercise of executive authority, and we find presidents of both parties either criticised or praised for having established these executive branch precedence. There's also just the expan-- - And just to make sure. - Yeah."
Social Studies,"- [Presenter] I wish to understand, I mean, it's just this idea that even if you were just president, I come in into office, I might even be more restrained, but then the next guy or, or gal (chuckles) that comes in can cite you presidency and say hey, he did it, why shouldn't I be able to do it, so there's this, it's never gonna go back. Precedent will never take you, take powers away, (chuckles) they'll only add to them."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffery] That's exactly right and this really important, but not so well known office, the Office of Legal Counsel, which several Supreme Court Justices have been the head of, is, basically, a mini-Supreme Court for the executive branch and it issues opinions about what the president can do and those opinions are relied on by subsequent presidents to justify the expansion of executive power. - [Presenter] Fascinating. - [Jeffery] Not all presidents have taken this view."
Social Studies,"I'm writing a book, now, about William Howard Taft who was the only president who went on to become Chief Justice and he thought, he had a very literalist or judicial conception of the presidency, he thought the president could only do what the Constitution explicitly authorized. He refused to take actions that he thought weren't authorized by the Constitution, and in this sense, he gives us a vision of what a more constitutionally constrained presidency would look like."
Social Studies,"- [Presenter] But even though he did that, as we were just talking about, people who came after Taft could just cite people before Taft (chuckles) and say-- - [Jeffery] Absolutely right, and Taft's predecessor, Theodore Roosevelt, had the most sweeping conception of the presidency."
Social Studies,"He said the president can do whatever the Constitution doesn't explicitly forbid and his stewardship conception of the presidency definitely has been vindicated by time and you'd have to say presidents today are much more Rooseveltian than they are the heirs of William Howard Taft. (chuckles) - [Presenter] Yep. What other dynamics are at play? We talk about political culture that celebrity into one person, this precedent that keeps expanding powers."
Social Studies,"What else? - [Jeffery] Well, there's the huge expansion of the Federal government, and the administrative state, and the growth of the executive agencies in the post-New Deal period from the Environmental Protection Agency, and even progressive-era agencies, like the Federal Trade Commission or the Federal Reserve, and work place safety, National Park management, smoke stack emissions, college sports. There's almost no area of American life that these executive agencies don't regulate."
Social Studies,"The president, by appointing the head of these agencies and having the ability to fire them, can issue executive orders that have the force of law, even though they're not passed by Congress, and that can lead to really dramatic clashes between the president's use of executive orders and what Congress says that it actually intended, as we've seen during the Obama administration. So that's a big factor, as well. - [Presenter] Yep."
Social Studies,"And what other dynamics are there? - [Jeffery] Well, the modern world is moving a lot faster, in an age of the internet and instant communication, there are a lot more emergencies, attacks are much more sudden than they were at the time of the framing and have to be repelled more quickly, so just the speed of contemporary life has led to the president to assert new emergency powers. And then, finally, and I'm just tracking William Marshall's great essay, here, there's the rise of partisan politics."
Social Studies,"Because of Congress becoming so polarized, often people in Congress see their responsibility to support their party rather than to take seriously their Constitutional or institutional duties as legislatures, so they may be unwilling to, or check the president's power when their party is in the majority, they're just willing to write the president a blank check when he happens to be a member of their party."
Social Studies,"- [Presenter] And I can see that when it's the same party in charge of Congress and the presidency, but what about when it's the other way around? Obviously, in recent time it seems like the, Congress is being very effective at limiting presidential power. - [Jeffery] Well-- - [Presenter] Because of partisan politics."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffery] You do have either congressional inaction or refusal to act on presidential proposals, but often, critics of congressional inaction complain Congress is refusing to veto bills, for example, or sorry, to override presidential vetos or to refuse to pass laws on constitutional grounds. Instead, they're filing lawsuits, they're kicking things up to the court. When President Obama issued his executive orders about immigration, there was a lawsuit filed."
Social Studies,"So, increasingly, the judiciary is becoming the arbiter about disputes between Congress and the president. The Framers expected a much more direct clash between the president and Congress and thought that both of those branches of government would make decisions on constitutional grounds and would directly check each other."
Social Studies,"- [Presenter] It's this idea that instead of Congress passing legislation and then the president either signing them or vetoing them, that when you have this gridlock, that the president starts taking more executive orders, and then Congress take the president to court (laughter) over them. - [Jeffery] That's very well stated and that's definitely not what the Framers intended."
Social Studies,"- [Presenter] This is really, just to go over them once again, when you just have one person in charge, and this is, it starts with Washington who was this huge personality, obviously American hero, and so that, by itself, put a lot of power in the president. Then every president comes along and maybe does a little bit more (chuckles) than the ones that came before it."
Social Studies,"And then anyone can cite that president, hey, he pulled it off, why can't I? As you mentioned, the Federal Government is far, far, far larger than it was in the time of, when the Constitution was written and in the time of Washington, and just the speed with which things are happening, it's necessary for a president to, whether it's in war, or regulation, or other things, to just be able to take action quickly."
Social Studies,"And then finally, partisan politics, I guess, that one could, it seems that could be debated either way depending on which parties are in power where, but it is fascinating, it does seem like this has been a very clear trend over time. - [Jeffery] It's true. Those are all great reasons offered by William Marshall in his interactive Constitution essay."
Social Studies,"There's one other factor and that is the fact that both branches, the president and Congress, are not evaluating their actions on constitutional grounds the way they used to. The president has the veto power under Article I, Section 7 and at the time of the framing, the presidents often issued vetos on constitutional grounds."
Social Studies,"President Andrew Jackson who vetoed the re-chartering of the second bank of the United States vetoed it on the grounds that he could veto any bill that he considered unconstitutional and he sided with Thomas Jefferson's view that the bank was unconstitutional, rejecting the view of Hamilton and George Washington that is was okay."
Social Studies,"But nowadays, presidents tend not to issue vetos on constitutional grounds and Congress tends not to debate bill in constitutional terms and as a result, critics on both sides of the aisle say both branches are exceeding their constitutional powers and failing adequately to check the constitutional excesses of the other branch."
Social Studies,"- [Presenter] That's fascinating, something I never fully appreciated that, what you mentioned is historically, Washington, and Adams, and Jefferson, they viewed their veto as kind of like a light Supreme Court, a little bit, like is this constitutional or not, and that's why I'll veto it. But then later presidents started to say, no, if I just disagree with it, I just think it's a bad law, I will veto."
Social Studies,"- [Jeffery] Absolutely, and this idea that the Supreme Court is the sole authority, arbiter, of constitutional, of the constitutionality of laws would've surprised the Framers. They had a theory of departmentalism. They thought that all three branches had an obligation to evaluate the constitutionality of laws, that Congress, when they passed a bill, the president, when he signed it, and the courts, when they reviewed it, and only when all three branches agreed, could a law go into effect."
Social Studies,"But that, now, we tend to punt all constitutional questions to the Supreme Court and that has left something of a vacuum on the side of the president and the Congress. - [Presenter] Well, thanks so much for this, Jeff. - [Jeffery] Thank you.."
Social Studies,"He thinks, frankly, that rewriting the rules of the country, it's not gonna work. But they finally convince him to come and they make him president of the convention. And they put him at the front of the room, and he says almost nothing during the entire four months. But what he does is at the front of the room he is a model, because, remember, he resigned his commission as commander of the Continental Army and gave up power."
Social Studies,"He didn't seize the power that he had as, he was basically the biggest celebrity in America, and he gave his commission back to the government, which was an act of sublimating his own personal self interest for the benefit of the republic. And that's the model they wanted for the Constitution."
Social Studies,"So he didn't say much, but they designed basically, as one writer said that what they were essentially doing was writing his future job description, because everybody in the room knew he would ultimately become the president, because there was nobody else in America like him. And what was important was not that he was a general, but that he had this virtue inside of him, which was that he would know how far to go and when to stop, and when to protect those liberties."
Social Studies,"And so he sat on a chair with a sun on the back of it, and at the end of the proceedings, Benjamin Franklin, who was the only other great, kind of, superstar in America who participated in the convention said that he looked at that sun on Washington's chair, and he wasn't sure whether it was a rising sun or a setting sun, but now after they finished their work, he had decided that the sun was rising, which was basically anointing and blessing everything that had happened there, and this new office of presidency that they had created, that George Washington was to go walk into, and that's why Washington's statue is in front of Independence Hall where the Constitutional Convention took place."
Social Studies,"But in the dialogue over four months, you almost never see his words. He was there as a symbol and participant, but not like James Madison, or James Wilson, or Gouverneur Morris who were in there in the nitty gritty of every little detail. - Do we know what Washington was thinking, did he want the job, did he have a view, or he just said, ""Hey, I'm just gonna do what everyone else decides""? - Fortunately, they did everything in secret."
Social Studies,"Washington was so virtuous that he didn't even write about it in his diary. Now, fortunately, we have other people who did keep diaries, and James Madison took notes and said, ""Publish them only after all 55 members are dead."" What Washington thought is he wanted a central government, because as a general he knew there had to be an army to handle rebellions, and there had been Shays' Rebellion that had tested under the Articles of Confederation."
Social Studies,"So he wanted a strong government, but he was, and he was very worried that having been successful revolutionaries, they could do what he knew was hard by history, which is that revolutionaries aren't very good at creating governments. And so he knew that what they were doing was a real risk and a real gamble. He believed that it could be done, however. He believed that a strong national government was required."
Social Studies,"But then was he was given the job, he was incredibly nervous, this incredible military leader basically thought that he might fail. It was more likely than not that this whole darn thing would fail and that he might fail. And as he rode to his inauguration, he kept writing letters and in his diary talking about how the expectations of his countrymen were just too much for him. And that was both a personal worry, and he also worried about monarchy."
Social Studies,"How does monarchy build? It's either when a monarch demands power or when the mob hands all of the power to the person and says, ""Do everything for us,"" and gives them ultimate power. And what they knew in the convention was that human beings were sinful and could not handle power. If they were given the power, they would abuse it as surely as the sun comes up in the morning. And he was worried that if given too much power, perhaps he could be susceptible to that."
Social Studies,"And so he was for as confident and as much of a model of strength that he was, he was a very nervous guy. - And it sounds like an unusual person where the power, at least as the history I've read, didn't corrupt him and he didn't try to do a power grab. - That's right, Washington was constantly, he was a man of a rigid code, and he believed that the standards were necessary for the proper kind of human behavior."
Social Studies,"He wrote a list of a hundred different things that a gentleman should do to comport himself in the proper way in society, and that's what made him such a good model. - I'd like a copy of that. - (laughs) Yes, exactly. - I have a feeling I don't check most of them off. (laughing) - We'd all be better. But things like clearing your throat, how you behave in the presence of a lady. And he believed in these codes, because he believed if everybody maintained them, then the system would work."
Social Studies,"This was during the period where Newton's laws were making people think about a clockwork universe where if everything runs, if the machine is put together with tension, right, so it recognized that people were not angels, tension in the machine, but if everybody did their thing and the pieces stayed in their lane, as it were, then the clock would work."
Social Studies,"And so he had that code which tried to keep him in his place and keep everybody else in his place, and he set a standard, and then everybody tried to live up to it, as opposed to saying, ""Well, that standard's nice, ""but I'm now gonna go do this."" And that's why when he resigned his military commission, and he also undid a coup that some of his men were planning back when he was leader of the army."
Social Studies,"They were basically gonna go to Congress and say, this is in Newburgh, New York, they were gonna go to Congress and say, ""Unless you give us our money, ""we're gonna stage a coup."" He found out about the plot, went to his men and said, ""This is a sin both against the revolution ""and my own personal virtue, ""because I put myself on the line."" They backed off. And what he coulda done is say, ""Let's go, let's ride to Washington and get you your money. ""You fought in this war."
Social Studies,"""Your wives and children are begging and poor. ""You deserve this money. ""Let's use our power and authority and take it,"" and he said, ""No."" Joseph Ellis, the historian, writes about it as being the last temptation of Washington as a general. He has the chance to grab the power, and he says, ""No, we shouldn't do it."" And that's why he was a model, because he could resist the pull of power, and that's the image in which they wanted to create this new government. - Wow.."
Social Studies,"and in future videos we'll talk more about Cyrus the Great and Darius the Great and the various Shah and Shahs King of Kings of the Persian empire, but you can see it was a massive empire. Not only did it contain modern Iran which is really the heart of the Persian empire, but much of the modern Middle East including Turkey, you have Egypt here we go into central Asia and also Afghanistan and even parts of Pakistan."
Social Studies,"But before talking more about how it was established and who established it, I'm gonna dig down a little bit into the word ""Persia"" because just as the ancient Greeks did not refer to where they lived as Greece that is a Latin idea of calling it Greece, the Greeks referred to where they lived as ""Hellas"", it turns out that the Persians did not refer to where they lived as ""Persia""."
Social Studies,"Their terms are actually much closer to ideas around land of the Aryans, so there's, based on my research, ideas like Aryan-Vega and Aran-Shah and Aran. So it actually turns out that the modern name of the country, the modern word Iran is probably more appropriate or in some ways closer to what the region has always called itself, what the Iranians or the Persians have always called themselves, and called where they lived."
Social Studies,"They referred to themselves as the Aryans and where they lived as the Aryanan-Vega or Aran, or Aran-Shah or some version of that and the modern version is Iran."
Social Studies,"Now, with that said, you might say, ""Well, why did the Greeks call it Persia?"" Well, the Persian empire what we consider to be the first true Persian empire is the Achaemenid empire, and we'll talk in a second why do we call it even the Achaemenid, but the Achaemenid empire emerges from a region of Persia, I guess we can say, that in this map is referred to as Persus, but other names for it are Pars, and even in modern Iran there's a region called Fars which coincides very close with it."
Social Studies,"And since the leaders of the Persian empire, and especially Cyrus the Great, emerged from this region, they called them the Persians and it was the ""Persian"" empire that emerges from this region which you might wanna call Pars, Fars. Fars especially comes from Arabic where they don't have the P sound, but Pars or Persus or whatever you wanna call it, and that's why it was called the Persian empire. Now, it wasn't the first empire in that region."
Social Studies,"Before the Persian empire gets established or what we associate with the Persian or the Achaemenid empire of Cyrus the Great, much of this region of where we call modern day Iran was controlled by the Medians, and you can see Media is this region right over here. And it was Cyrus the Great that in 549, some accounts say 550 B.C.E., is able to overthrow the Median emperor who happens to be his grandfather. And that is the really dawn of the Achaemenid dynasty."
Social Studies,"Now the next question and this was established, let me write this down, this was established by Cyrus the Great, he was Cyrus the II but he became Cyrus the Great because he was able to break out and overthrow the Medians and establish this massive empire."
Social Studies,"And the reason why it's called the Achaemenid empire not the Cyrid empire, is that Cyrus claims to be from the family of the patriarch Achaemenis and a lot of these names, these are come from Greek accounts so that's why they sound a little bit more Greek. But Achaemenis is a semi-legendary figure that, we're not sure exactly when he lived, but the best accounts I could see is near the beginning of the seventh century B.C.E."
Social Studies,"And Cyrus the Great is from Achaemenis' family, and so since they came to power, this first really Persian empire, when the people talk about the Persian empire they don't tend to refer to the Median empire, they're really referring to the Achaemenid empire, that's why it's called Achaemenid."
Social Studies,"Now, in future videos we'll talk more about what happened in the Achaemenid empire, but you can see the extent of it was pretty significant and it lasts for a little over 200 years until they're conquered by foreigners. And the foreigners that conquer them are the Greeks. Philip of Macedon's son, Alexander the Great, is able to, on some level, unify Greece and Persia."
Social Studies,"And it's interesting because a lot of what we learn about ancient Persia, it's accounts from the Greeks, from folks like Herodotus, but during the time of classical Greece, Greece was really a bit of a sideshow, it was really this kind of thorn in the side of Persia. Persia was really where the power was."
Social Studies,"But as we get to the mid or the end of the fourth century B.C.E., Persia weakens, Greece unifies under Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great and Alexander the Great is able to conquer the Persian empire."
Social Studies,"And he is short-lived, we have videos on Alexander the Great I encourage you to watch them, his life is short-lived and his unified empire is short-lived, but he has this dream of mixing the cultures and really being a unified people, but as soon as he dies his empire splits, but the Persian empire for the most part, is in the control of the Seleucid's."
Social Studies,"And the Seleucid dynasty, this is essentially foreign rule 'cause Seleucus, who establishes Seleucid dynasty, he is one of Alexander's generals, he's fundamentally Greek, and so the rulers of the Seleucid dynasty are Greek. And you don't get back to having Persian rule until 238 B.C.E. It's in 238 B.C.E."
Social Studies,"that the Parthian's emerge to conquer the empire and so, once again you could say, ""Well, this is back to non-foreign rule."" It's really important to keep in mind, because in it's day the Achaemenid empire was, if not the dominant, one of the very dominant empires of the world. At it's peak it had a population, this is roughly under Darius the Great, and we'll talk more about him, he was an interesting character, but the Achaemenid empire at it's peak had approximately 50 million people."
Social Studies,"And that's a lot of people at any time in history, but especially at that time in history because at that time in history there was only a little over 100 million people in the world, or at least that's our current estimates. So this is actually the largest proportion of the world's population that any empire has ever had in history, as far as we can tell, so that gives it some claim to being maybe the greatest or one of the greatest empires in world history."
Social Studies,"And then, as we get into the Seleucid and especially the Parthian empire, you know, in the West we talk a lot about the glory of the Roman empire, but the Parthian's were right there beside of them, and they kind of went back and forth but they were side by side, the peak of the Parthian empire coincides with the peak of the Roman empire, and they give each other space and they went back and forth especially around the Middle East."
Social Studies,"And you have this empire from the Parthian's you go to the Sassanian's and eventually in the seventh century C.E., Islam comes into the Persian empire and becomes the dominant religion. And so that might make you ask, ""Well, what was the dominant religion before that?"" And the answer there is Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrianism. And it was really Cyrus the Great, by establishing the Persian empire, who really spreads Zoroastrianism. And Zoroastrianism is based on their prophet Zarathustra."
Social Studies,"And when Zarathustra lived is up for some debate, it might be as early as 1500 B.C.E., some people say it might be even right before even coincident with the life of Cyrus the Great, so there's some debate on when Zarathustra lived, but it was a monotheistic religion, following the one god of Ahura Mazda. Ahura Mazda. And it was based on these ideas of good thoughts lead to good words and good deeds. Other big ideas of the Persian empire is their system of governments, of governants."
Social Studies,"Because it was such a vast empire they delegated the emperor, the Shah and Shah, the King of Kings, delegated authority to the regions so each region, each satrapy had it's governor called a satrap. And as we see over time, some of these satraps got more power then maybe was intended and then eventually took over."
Social Studies,"But this was a major empire in the history of the world, they unified people, they're famous for royal road that connected Sardis all the way, all the way to Sousa, as you can imagine it would have facilitated the transfer of knowledge and the transfer of trade. Under the Seleucid's you had huge Greek influence, but it was two way street. Not only did the Greeks influence the Persians, but the Persians heavily influenced the Greeks."
Social Studies,"So with that, in the next few videos we'll go into even more depth on the Persian empire and specifically the Achaemenid's.."
Social Studies,"I'll draw the rough border right over here. Was something like that. And you can see the dominant region of Media right over here. But, by the middle of that century, they are going to be overthrown. They're going to be overthrown by one of their subject kingdoms. And that is the Persians. And so, right over here on this map, it's called Persis, but that region is called Pars or Fars. And, even today in modern Iran, that region is called Fars. And the king of Pars was Cyrus the Great."
Social Studies,"And, in 550/549 BCE, he's able to overthrow the Median emperor, who happens to be his grandfather, and then he establishes what history views as the first real Persian empire. And the whole reason why we even call it a Persian empire is because Cyrus the Great was from Pars. Persian is really referring to the idea that the ruler, the dynasty that gets established, was coming from Pars. It turns out, and I talk about in other videos, the Persians did not refer to themselves as Persians."
Social Studies,"They viewed themselves more as the Aryan people. In a lot of ways, Eran or Iran or Arianum of Asia, these types of words are more accurate for how the Persians viewed themselves. But, needless to say, in 549, Cyrus the Great is able to conquer the Median Empire and he keeps going. And what he establishes, this empire, this dynasty, is called the Achaemednid Dynasty."
Social Studies,"And you might wonder why is it called the Achaemenid Dynasty, instead of, say, the Cyrid Dynasty? And that's because Cyrus claims descendant from Achaemenes. He is part of that family. Achaemenes is this semi-legendary patriarch of it that lived 100, 150 years before Cyrus the Great. And so, I will draw a dotted line from Achaemenes to Cyrus. And Cyrus then goes on. So, he conquers the Median Empire, then he goes on to conquer several of the major empires of that time. In the mid-540's BCE...."
Social Studies,"So, we are right around there. He conquers the Lydian Empire, right over there, which is on the western half of the Anatolian Peninsula in modern day Turkey. And then, he sets his sight on the Neo-Babylonian Empire. And, in 539, he's able to conquer the Neo-Babylonian Empire. And, from a Biblical perspective, that's relevant. Because, when he takes Babylon, he frees the Jews from the Babylonian captivity and he resettles them in Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"And he works with them to rebuild the city of Jerusalem and, especially, Solomon's Temple, which is now called the Second Temple on the Temple Mount. And Cyrus the Great is viewed by history as one of the great rulers of all time. Often referred to as a model ruler. Someone who really takes the interest of his people at heart. So, Cyrus was able to conquer a lot of what you see here in green, but not all of it. And, especially, he was not able to get to Egypt. That would be left to his son, Cambyses."
Social Studies,"So, in 530, Cyrus dies and Cambyses takes over. And, just so you read how I made this timeline... And I made this timeline, really, to help myself understand the various shahanshahs or king of kings of Iran. So, Cyrus the Great was the shahanshah, king of kings. And then, Cambyses II was the next one. Is that, this timeline up here, this shows who was in charge."
Social Studies,"So, you see from 550/549 all the way up to 530, I have it yellow and that's 'cause Cyrus the Great was in charge of what is called the Achaemenid Empire or, I guess you could say, this first great Persian empire. What I have down here is the best information I could find on the lifespans of these people. And, when I have these dotted lines at the beginning, that's when it's unclear when these people were born. So, there's different accounts that Cyrus the Great might have been born in 575 BCE."
Social Studies,"He might have been born closer to 600 BCE. And so, that's why I have these dotted lines. Similarly, we don't know exactly when Cambyses II was born, but we do know that he took control in 530 BCE. And so, that's why you see Cambyses, you see this line right over here turn blue. And, actually Cambyses ends up dying in 522. So, actually, this should be like that. There you go. He ends up dying in 522. But, before he dies in 522, he is able to conquer Egypt in 525 BCE. So, right around there."
Social Studies,"And you can imagine that, while he's conquering Egypt... Let me keep drawing this family tree. So, now we have Cambyses II. He goes off, makes his real goal to conquer Egypt. And that's a big deal. Remember, this is ending thousands of years of the rule by the native pharaohs. These now foreign rulers start calling themselves the pharaohs of Egypt, as well."
Social Studies,"Egypt becomes part of the Persian Empire because of Cambyses, but you can imagine with the shahanshah, the king of kings, off and doing conquest in Egypt, it leaves a little power vacuum back in the center of the empire. And this is when things get a little bit sketchy. So, Cyrus does have another son. Th other son is called Bardiya. So, let me write this down. So, there's another son called Bardiya. And then, there's this other character known as Darius, soon to be known as Darius the Great."
Social Studies,"And Darius is not a direct descendant of Cyrus the Great, but he is part of his family. He's a distant relative. He is part of the Achaemenid dynasty. He claims descendant from Achamenes. And he was the lance-bearer for Cambyses II. So, while Cambyses is out here in Egypt leaving that power vacuum, someone who claims to be Bardiya takes control of the empire or is trying to take control of the empire. Now, some accounts say that this is really Bardiya."
Social Studies,"This is really the other son of Cyrus the Great and so there would be some legitimate claim to the throne, but there's other claims, especially the ones that Darius was later able to spread, that, no, this was not the real Bardiya. That this was a fake Bardiya. That the real Bardiya had actually been killed by Cambyses II before and that this person proposing to be Bardiya was this fake usurper, this Zoroastrian priest named Gaumata. And, once Cambyses, on his way...."
Social Studies,"He's trying to come back in order to reclaim the throne or in order to get rid of this usurper, whether it was the real Bardiya or not. But, on the way, he dies, once again, under dubious circumstances. Cyrus the Great, how he died, not clear. Cambyses II also dies under dubious circumstances. And then this Bardiya actually becomes the shahanshah for real. He obviously has claims to it while Cambyses is there, but, once Cambyses dies, he is the shaanshah. Well, Darius doesn't like this."
Social Studies,"He has his own imperial ambitions. He gets some other nobility together and says, ""No, no, no, this Bardiya isn't the real Bardiya. He's a usurper. Let's go kill that guy."" And so, they kill him and then... It's an interesting story. Herodotus has a fairly dubious account of how Darius was able to convince the other noble people why he should be the shahanshah, the emperor. But they are able to get rid of Bardiya. We still do not know whether it was the real Bardiya or whether it was the fake Bardiya."
Social Studies,"But then, Darius takes power in 522 BCE. And he's known as Darius the Great because he continues to spread, continues to conquer more and more for the Persian Empire. And this map, right over here, this is the Persian Empire in 500 BCE under Darius the Great. It's near its maximum extent. And it's a pretty incredible empire. It's worth noting.... And it's big by any stretch of the imagination. But it's at this time the population is on the order of 50 million people."
Social Studies,"And, based on the accounts that I've seen, that's almost half of the world population at that time. No empire in history, as far as we can tell, has ever had such a large fraction of the world's population under its control. And so, that gives you a sense of, I guess you could say, how great or how large an empire this was. Now Darius the Great, he is also famous, especially from a Greek perspective, for going after the Greeks."
Social Studies,"You had these Greek revolts in these towns on the west coast of the Anatolian Peninsula. They revolted against their Persian overlords, I guess you could say. And they did that with the help of the Athenians. And so, Darius didn't like this. In the 490's, he starts going after the Athenians. This is the beginning of the Greco-Persian Wars. He is unsuccessful. He dies in the 480's and then his son... This is actually a relief of Darius the Great right over here from Persepolis."
Social Studies,"And then, his son continues to try to take over in the Second Greco-Persian Wars. And he, too, is unsuccessful. But, it's worth noting, a lot of this history that we get, especially of Cyrus the Great and the early Persian shahanshas, the history we get is from the Greeks. So, it's worth taking it with a great grain of salt, because, as you can see, they were rivals. And to say rivals is a little bit unfair to the Persians, because the Greeks were more of a thorn in the side of a large empire."
Social Studies,"The Greeks were this group of city-states. They weren't even a unified empire. While you had here the Persian Empire controls almost half of the world's population. So, the Greeks were more of a thorn in the side, but we get our history from them or a lot of our history from them. So, we get their account of things. Now, once you have Xerxes, then, after Xerxes, you have Artaxerxes, right over here. And then, you have a little bit of a squabble for the throne and then Darius II."
Social Studies,"There's one thing that you see over 200 years of Achaemenid rule is that most people, after Darius the Great, are named either Xerxes, Artaxerxes, Darius II, III, IV, or Darius II or III, at least, not fourth. Artaxerxes II, Artaxerxes III. So, it can get a little confusing."
Social Studies,"But the reason why I even did this for myself, to see when all these people lived and when they ruled, is to have a good sense of what was going on and how Darius II lived at a different time than, for example, Darius I, or Darius the Great. The other thing worth mentioning, 'cause you'll hear this in various history classes when you talk about the Persian Empire, is the great cities of the Persian Empire. Cyrus the Great, he establishes the capital at Pasargadae right over here."
Social Studies,"You have Cambyses establishes a capital at Susa. Susa is one end of the great royal highway that goes from Sardis all the way to Susa right over there. You have Darius the Great establish a capital at Persepolis. And that's the Greek name for it, literally referring to Persian city. And this is a relief from Persepolis right over here. Now, the end of the Achaemenid Dynasty comes when that famous thorn in the side, Greece, actually unifies under Philip of Macedon."
Social Studies,"Here, we're talking about the early to mid-fourth century BCE. And his son, Alexander, becomes this great conqueror, Alexander the Great. And he's able to conquer the entire Persian Empire, famously taking it away from Darius III. We talk about that in another video or in several videos in some detail. But, Alexander the Great, he has this vision of one nation of these people. Their cultures mixing together. And there's a significant amount of cultural mix between the Greeks and the Persians."
Social Studies,"But then, Alexander dies and his empire is split. But most of the Persian Empire goes under the control of Seleucus, who's one of Alexander's generals, and then you have the Seleucid Empire, which is really foreign rule of Persia. And that will continue for a while. Until, eventually, the Parthians, which is, once again, another state or region of the Persian Empire, takes control to establish the Parthian Empire, which is one of the rivals to Rome."
Social Studies,"It's worth mentioning, and I mention this in the video on ancient Persia, that, under Persian rule, and Cyrus and the various shahanshahs were famous for delegating their authority. When you have such a large empire, you can't control all of it yourself. So, each of these regions had their own, I guess you could say, governors. And those governors were called satraps and the regions were called satrapies. Anyway, I will leave you there."
Social Studies,"Oh, and the other thing that Cyrus the Great is really known for, is the spread of the Zoroastrian faith. We talk about the Zoroastrian faith in other videos. And Zarathustra, who is kind of the prophet of the Zoroastrian faith, he lived someplace between 1500 BCE and might have even lived shortly right before, almost near the time of Cyrus the Great. But it was really Cyrus the Great who helps spread this great ancient faith.."
Social Studies,"And Zoroaster is the Greek name for Zarathustra, and sometimes the religion is referred to as Zarathustrianism. And it's one of the oldest religions we have, and it's an existing religion. People still practice Zoroastrianism. In terms of when it started, there's some debate. A lot of accounts have it starting as early or even earlier than 3,500 years ago, so around 1500 BCE, and some accounts put it a little bit closer to Cyrus the Great, maybe 700 or 600 BCE."
Social Studies,"And the accounts, or the beginning of the religion is really around the teachings of Zarathustra, and his teachings really establish one of the first often viewed as monotheistic religions of the world, this idea that there is one god, and that god in the Zoroastrian faith is Ahura Mazda. Ahura Mazda. And it's viewed that Ahura Mazda does not take a human form."
Social Studies,"It is even, you cannot even conceive of, you know, fully conceive, the human mind can't fully conceive of Ahura Mazda, but Ahura Mazda is the, in the Zoroastrian faith, the one and only god. But in conjunction with the idea of Ahura Mazda, a lot of people refer to Zoroastrianism as a dualistic faith. A dualistic faith means that there's this kind of interest in counterbalancing forces. For example, light versus dark, and of course good versus evil."
Social Studies,"And one of the main ideas or words here are the ideas of asha and druj. So asha, these are the ideas of being principled, honest, ordered, and druj is the opposite. Druj is the idea of being unprincipled, dishonest, chaotic. And so there's a lot of talk and kind of insight or trying to get a better understanding of these dualistic natures in the world, and trying for humanity be on the side of the good, the light, the ordered, the principled, the honest."
Social Studies,"Now right over here is a key symbol of Zoroastrianism that you might see. It's called the Faravahar. I'm probably be mispronouncing it. Faravahar, and there's a lot of symbolism here. It shows the connection of the universe to humanity, you see the depiction of a human being here, and the three layers of the wings depict these three very important ideas in Zoroastrianism."
Social Studies,"The first layer is good thoughts, the second layer right over here of wings are good words, and then the third layer here is good actions, good actions. And it makes sense. You kind of imagine this idea that good thoughts lead to good words, and that combined, they can lead to good actions. And on the tail here, and these are the things you should avoid, these are the bad thoughts, the bad actions, or the bad thoughts, the bad words, and the bad actions."
Social Studies,"Along lines this ideas of dualism, especially the fascination with the ideas of light, fire is a very important element of the Zoroastrian faith. In fact, if you visit a Zoroastrian temple, you will see an eternal fire, and they feed that fire five times a day. Another very important element of the faith is water. And the sacred text for the Zoroastrians is called the Avesta."
Social Studies,"And the Avesta is written in a language called Avestan, and it's called Avestan because it's the language that the Avesta was written in, but it's written in a language that is closely related to ancient Sanskrit, and so there's probably some connections, or for sure there's some connections, between ancient Hinduism and the progenitor or some of the preexisting ideas that might, that Zarathustra developed or might have built on top of."
Social Studies,"Now one of the really interesting things about Zoroastrianism is that even though today it's a relatively small faith, on the order of less than 200,000 people around the world practice it, and most of them are in India and the United States, at one time, it was, you could view it as the state religion of ancient Persia, but then eventually, in the seventh century CE, when Persia, or Iran, became Islamic, you have a Zoroastrian diaspora, especially moving to India and then eventually places like the United States, although there are still practicing Zoroastrians in Iran."
Social Studies,"But above and beyond the continuing legacy of the Zoroastrians, they've had a lot of influence on some of the major religions of the world. And what you have on this timeline here, I've made some of the major religions. You see up here in blue you have Judaism, and the reason why I draw the dotted line is these are periods and it's not exact, you know, these religions are evolving and they are forming and they're getting more and more tradition over time."
Social Studies,"So you hear Judaism, and of course, Christianity is in a lot ways built on top of Judaism. Jesus was Jewish. You have Islam right over here, which of the major world religions is one of the newest, in a lot of ways built or related to Christianity and Judaism."
Social Studies,"And even though the Zoroastrianism is related and it kind of comes out of a similar kind of early Aryan people type of religion, it has a lot of influence on some of these other traditional, or these mainstream religions that we have in the world today. As we mentioned, it's viewed as a monotheistic religion, and it's also had direct influence on, for example, Christianity. So right over here, this is from John Bowker, who's a famous Christian theologian."
Social Studies,"He wrote in his book World Religions ""that angels, the end of the world, ""a final judgement, the resurrection, ""and heaven and hell received form and substance ""from Zoroastrian beliefs."" In Christian tradition, the Three Wise Men, the Three Kings, the Three Magi that visit the baby Jesus, Magi, this is referring to Zoroastrian priests who were visiting the baby Jesus."
Social Studies,"And the word magic comes from the word magi, because the Zoroastrian elite, the priests, they were very capable in the sciences of astronomy, and they were also very well-known for their astrology, and so some people associated them with, you know, magical capabilities. It also has close ties to Islam. The sacred fire in Zoroastrianism is fed five times a day."
Social Studies,"Zoroastrians pray five times a day, and before prayer, they go through a ritual around washing themselves to cleanse themselves, where they wash themselves three times before each prayer. That is something that we see in Islam. So Zoroastrianism, it's the faith of ancient Persia popularized by Cyrus the Great, and it's a living religion, even today, although it's a much smaller population that practices it. But as we've seen, it's had a lot of influence on many of the major world religions.."
Social Studies,"And just to start, let's begin with the name Greece. It turns out that the Greeks do not call where they live, Greece, neither did the ancient Greeks. They called it Hellas. Hellas, Hellas. And the word Hellas comes from Hellen, so this comes from Hellen, which is this legendary figure who is viewed as a progenitor of the Greek people. You could kind of view him as the father of the Greek people."
Social Studies,"And it's not well established in the historical record when Hellen actually existed, but this is where we get the name Hellas from. And it's very important. Do not confuse this Hellen, who was a man, with Helen of Troy. Helen of Troy was a different person. When I was a child and I heard about Hellenic things or the Hellenic period, or the Hellenes, I was like, oh, maybe that's something to do with Helen of Troy. That's referring to the Greek progenitor Hellen."
Social Studies,"And so that's where the word Hellas comes from, and ideas like Hellenes, which is the Greek people. Or Hellenic, which is referring to something that is Greek, or the Hellenistic Period, which we'll talk about many videos from now, which is this period of Greek influence. Not just over Greece and the Anatolian Peninsula, but over Persia and over Egypt. So with that out of the way, let's now talk about the big arc of history of ancient Greece."
Social Studies,"And it's believed that the Greek Peninsula has been settled by human beings for thousands and thousands of years. And as time goes on we'll hopefully understand more and more about them. But my timeline right over here starts with Mycenaean Greece, or it starts with the end of Mycenaean Greece. In other videos we might talk more about the Mycenaean Empire. And as that empire falls, we enter into the Greek Dark Ages."
Social Studies,"And the reason why it's called the Dark Ages, is there's not a lot of historical record of this period roughly between 1100BCE and 800BCE. Now there's one event, and I'll kind of say that with a slight emphasis or a question that is worth noting here. I have Trojan War question mark around 1200BCE. Once again, there's not a strong historic record for the Trojan War, but it is a famous war, that was chronicled by Homer."
Social Studies,"And even Homer, we don't know if he really existed, or whether he was an entire literary tradition. But it was chronicled in the Iliad in the aftermath in the Odyssey. And once again, this was chronicled many hundreds of years later, and even Homer is a semi-legendary figure. But when people talk about the Trojan Wars or you see movies about it, we're talking about something that, if it happened the way it happened, it's on the order of 1200BCE."
Social Studies,"Now as we exit the Greek Dark Ages, that's when we start to have some of the institutions that really, that we now identify with the ancient Greeks, get established. You have the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle of Delphi, or Pythia, often known as the Oracle of Delphi. This is where leaders of the Greek city-states went for direction to understand what was likely to happen, to get prophecies."
Social Studies,"And this institution, the Oracle at Delphi, lasts through this entire period I have on my timeline, into Roman rule, for over 1000 years, where the Oracle at Delphi is a very, very prominent figure in influencing Greek leaders. At around the same time, you also have the Olympic Games, where they're held at Olympia, where people compete to show their athletic prowess. And this ancient Olympic Games once again, it continues on for over 1000 years."
Social Studies,"Our modern Olympics are just kind of a flash in the pan, and it was obviously modeled after the ancient Olympics, compared to how long this lasted. Now when most people think of Greece, they're actually talking about classical Greece. So this is the Classical Period right over here. And we're gonna do videos on a lot of these events, but it's roughly the period between the Persian invasions that were successfully put off, and the rise of Alexander and the fall of Alexander."
Social Studies,"And that's where you have all of these ideas of Greek democracy really kind of coming to the surface. Pericles, the Strategos of Athens, who had the influence to really help democracy flourish. Under his leadership, or during his leadership, you have the Acropolis and the Parthenon, these famous icons of Greek culture being established. But once again, this is in this period. That's in this period right over here. This is also the period that we associate with the famous Greek philosophers."
Social Studies,"These lines right over here are the lives of Socrates and Plato, who is Socrates' student, established the famous academy. Aristotle who was Plato's student and famous tutor of Alexander the Great. Now as I mentioned, you had these city-states, and the ones that are worth mentioning, all of them are worth mentioning. But I have in this diagram, the most significant city-states of ancient Greece that you'll hear a lot about. We talked about the Oracle at Delphi, the Olympic Games at Olympia."
Social Studies,"A lot of the conversation tends to focus around Sparta and around Athens. And then you'll also hear a lot about Corinth and Thebes. Sparta is famous for its militaristic society. It's often glorified. But it's also worth noting that they were significant slave owners. At different parts in Spartan history, they had somewhere between seven and 20 slaves for every Spartan. Athens is famous for its philosophy. It's famous for the birthplace of democracy."
Social Studies,"It's famous for its art, it's famous for its architecture, all of these areas are famous for its architecture. But it's also worth noting that during the Golden Age, and you have the Athenian Empire, they were also pretty brutal in putting down rebellion and in some ways subjugating different people. So it depends how you want to view things. And we're gonna have a lot of videos on all of these things."
Social Studies,"But at that time, we talk about these city-states, even though they shared a common language and common culture, they sent folks to the Olympic games, they went to the Oracle of Delphi, they were independent states. And it wasn't until you have Philip of Macedonia in the fourth century right over here, where he starts to really unify these Greek city-states, and it culminates with his son, Alexander the Great."
Social Studies,"And Alexander the Great not only unifies Greece, but he takes over the Persian Empire, and really kind of with his death, and he has a very short life, he ushers in the Hellenistic period, where you have Greek culture influencing that entire region. Not only Greece, not only what was the Persian Empire, the Middle East, Egypt, that whole region gets influenced by Greek culture. And Greece, I guess you could say, at the end, finally gets under Roman control, and it depends which date you wanna use it."
Social Studies,"In the middle of the second century BCE is when Greece itself falls to Rome, but then other parts of, I guess you could say, the Hellenistic world, finally succumb to Rome. For example, Ptolemaic Egypt in the first century BCE. But even then, even when it becomes part of the Roman Empire, it influences the Roman Empire very, very, very heavily. Now other things that you will hear us talk about when we discuss the Greeks, besides the democracy and the philosophy, we're gonna talk a lot about wars."
Social Studies,"And it's worth noting what Greek warriors looked like. So this is a depiction of Hoplites, which are Greek citizen soldiers in ancient Greece. And you'll also here about a phalanx. A phalanx is a formation where they walked or they marched very tightly together. And when archers came they would put all their shields up, and they'd almost be like this armored tank. And it was a very effective method of warfare. Another word that you will hear associated with Sparta and those slaves is Helots."
Social Studies,"Those were the names of those slaves. They weren't owned by individuals, they were actually owned by the state. Now some of the other cities here, Corinth, will come up a lot. It has a very strategic location in the Isthmus of Corinth. Notice to get from the mainland, or I guess into the Peloponnesian Peninsula, you have to go through this Isthmus. Thebes right here was a significant rival to Athens at different periods of Greek history. It was the dominant city."
Social Studies,"Now the last thing I wanna mention is there is a ton of culture that comes from the Greeks, and a lot of words that we even use today. For example, the word draconian, which is used for something that's very harsh. Well that comes from Draco's law, which came in the seventh century BCE from Athens. He was an Athenian legislator who composed a very harsh series of laws. That's where the word draconian comes from."
Social Studies,"When people say something is spartan, they kind of imagine it's something that's very basic or you just have the necessities. And it comes from the idea of Spartan culture that they really, everything revolved around military necessity. Even the word laconic, which means someone who says just enough to get their meaning across. It comes from the region where Sparta is, Laconia. The Spartans were famous for their kind of very terse speech."
Social Studies,"Famously, when Philip of Macedon was threatening the Spartans, and he's saying, ""If you don't come on to my side ""I'm going to do this and that to you ""if you don't become part of my kingdom, my empire, ""I'm going to do this to your city, ""I'm going to do that to your people."" And the Spartan's famous reply was, ""If."" which is kind of a good example of laconic speech. With that one word they were able to convey a lot. So I'm going to leave you there."
Social Studies,"In the next few videos, we're going to go into some depth on this. But it's important to realize that when people talk about ancient Greece, they're talking about a large span of history, and most of what we associate with ancient Greece, the Acropolis, the Parthenon, the Persian Wars, the great Greek philosophers, most of that is associated with the classical period, often associated with the Golden Age. Which is right around there."
Social Studies,"Well before this period, the Greeks weren't all these philosophers sitting around in togas. They might've been wearing togas, but at these earlier periods they were more adventurers and conquerors, and they might have been in small villages. And eventually those evolved into the city-states that especially in Athens and Sparta had their Golden Age in this period right over here.."
Social Studies,"We talked about it in previous videos how they were able to conquer the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE and then go on to conquer much of the middle east. They were able to conquer the long-lived Egyptian empire. They seemed somewhat unstoppable at this point in 490 BCE. At this point, we have Darius is ruler of the Persian Empire, the Achaemenic Empire, as it's often referred to."
Social Studies,"And they're able to keep expanding until they come across some unexpected, unexpectedly resistant people, and that's the Greeks. This is probably one of the most famous and legendary stories in history, the rivalry, the conflicts between the Persians and the Greeks. You should maybe take it with a little bit of grain of salt, because what we know of it, the history that I'm about to give you, comes to us from Herodotus. And Herodotus who's often known as the father of history, he was Greek."
Social Studies,"And he also lived after a lot of these conflicts happened and he wrote about these conflicts, his adult life was well after these happened, so he had to talk to people who were around that time and obviously, he is getting the Greek side of the story. There are no surviving Persian accounts for it, so you might want to take it with a grain of salt because the accounts of Herodotus do tend to make the Greeks look pretty good."
Social Studies,"But let's just talk about what happened, because taking it with a grain of salt, it is a fascinating series of stories. So you have Darius as king, you can see the extent of the Persian Empire in 490 BC or really at the turn of the century if we were to go back 10 years to 500 BCE, but they are in control of some folks who are are a little bit more rebellious than most of the people that are within the Persian Empire."
Social Studies,"And they are in this region right over here, known as Ionia, where you had Greek settlements that are now under Persian control. From 500 BCE to about 494 BCE, so kind of the first 10 years of the fifth century BCE, you have a series of revolts in Ionia. Let me zoom in on that a little bit, so we can see that, you can see our timeline, right over here. So this area, we're now zoomed in, this area is referred to as Ionia. This would be modern-day, the coast of modern-day Turkey."
Social Studies,"We're out here on the Anatolian Peninsula. And these rebellions in 498 BCE, the rebels are able to take over and burn down Sardis which is under Persian control. The Persians under Darius are not happy about this. So they send a force to, to take back control and also to get a little bit of revenge, because when the rebels were able to take over Sardis, they had help from some of their Greek brethren. It's important to note that the the Greeks weren't some type of a unified state."
Social Studies,"They weren't a unified Empire like the Persians were. They were a fragmented group of city-states. You have the famous Athens, Corinth, Sparta, all of these city-states, they shared a common language. They shared similar religion, but they were not one unified Empire. But when their brethren, the Greek rebels, these Ionic rebels, I guess you could say, rose up against the their Persian rulers, they had assistance from Athenians and from folks in Eritrea."
Social Studies,"So when Darius finds out about this, not only does he want to take back what the rebels had, he wants to suppress them, he wants to put down that rebellion. He also wants to have revenge on the Athenians and the Eritreans. So the first thing he does is he sends out a fleet in 492 BCE. You see his fleet here in green. This fleet that I am tracing. He sends it out in order to in order to, in order to seek revenge on the Athenians and the Eritreans."
Social Studies,"But he is unlucky and once again, these are the accounts of Herodotus. His fleet, his large fleet, runs into a storm and is mostly destroyed, and is mostly destroyed. And so in 492 BCE, the Persians are unsuccessful. But they are not satisfied. Darius is not happy with that idea that we are the largest empire known, we should be able to take on these fragmented Greeks, with a much smaller population, much less wealth than the mighty Persians do."
Social Studies,"So in 490 BCE, he sends out another attempt to take over, to seek revenge and to subjugate the Eritreans and the Athenians. This time he is a little bit more successful. His fleet is not destroyed. So this is in this brown color, I'll try to color it in. This brown color right over here, you can see the path of the fleet this time. And he is eventually, he is able to subjugate and take over Eritrea, but as he's going to Athens, which you can see right here, they decide to stop at Marathon."
Social Studies,"That word might be familiar to you and we'll talk about in a second why it is. That is where they're engaged by the Athenians. The Athenians are able to defeat the Persians. This is a very big deal in history. Once again, this is Herodotus' account, but up to that point, the Persians seemed invincible. But now the Athenians were able to actually destroy them in a battle."
Social Studies,"And the Persian fleet, they go back to their boats, they run back to their boats according to Herodotus and many of them are killed as they as they retreat. They're going to go back around the peninsula, potentially to go attack Athens. but they decide not to and they retreat. Now the word Marathon, this is a very big deal in history first of all, is that this mighty empire is put back in this battle."
Social Studies,"It oftentimes, historians will mark it as the beginning of a kind of Greek ascendancy, the ascendancy of Greek civilization, at the end of these Greco-Persian Wars. We're really just in the beginning periods of right now that's really the beginning of the Greek golden age. But as we'll see, the Greco-Persian wars are not over with the battle at Marathon. That was just the first major interaction over the next few decades."
Social Studies,"Now one thing that you might be saying is, hey, that word marathon, that seems familiar. Maybe some of you have run a marathon or you want to run a marathon going 26.2 miles. You might say, is there any relation to this battle, to this location in Greece called, Marathon. The simple answer is, yes. So there's an apocryphal story, and when people say apocryphal, they're like, ""Well, we're not sure if it really happened, ""or maybe it didn't happen."" And this one, people are pretty sure it didn't happen."
Social Studies,"The story goes something like, when they had the battle, a messenger was sent from Marathon to Athens and the distance from Marathon to Athens is roughly the distance of a modern marathon, around 25 or 26 miles. The apocryphal story goes, they went to deliver the message of the Persian attack and the success of the Athenians, and then when the messenger gave that message, he just passed out and died."
Social Studies,"So when the modern Olympics that we've set up now, over the last hundred and something years, they said, ""Hey, let's have an event ""that celebrates that run from Marathon to Athens."" That's where our modern marathon actually comes from. Now the actual story as best, as I can figure out, and I encourage you to look up primary documents to figure this out for yourself, is it's mixing up a few stories."
Social Studies,"After the victory at Marathon, the Athenian army did quickly mobilize and go back to Athens and cover that distance in order to defend Athens. Because remember it looks like the Persian fleet were coming around this peninsula right over here to get to Athens. The story of that runner is there was runner named, Filipides, who was sent from Athens to Sparta to convey a message. That's actually a much further distance."
Social Studies,"In a lot ways it's much more impressive, but those two stories were mixed up together into the story of Marathon, which is where we get our modern-day distance of the marathon. Hey, let's all run roughly the distance from Marathon to Athens. In the next video, we'll see that the Persians are not done. Darius will not be able to seek the revenge that he wants in his lifetime, but his son Xerxes is going to keep going at it.."
Social Studies,"Then in 490, he sends a fleet again, and then he is defeated by the Athenians at Marathon, and we saw that right over there. Let me do that in color you can actually see. But as I mentioned in the last video, the Persians were not done."
Social Studies,"Darius would not live to see another round with the Greeks, but his successor, Xerxes, would not only try another attempt, but he would amass a huge, huge force against the Greeks to, in his mind, finally take them over, and he wants it done so badly that he leads the forces himself. And so we are now 10 years after, 10 years after the first Persian invasion. We are now at 480 BCE, where Xerxes is going to try to invade Greece by land and by sea, but as we will see, he is also not going to be successful."
Social Studies,"But this second invasion is the stuff of legend, and once again, the historical accounts come to us primarily from Herodotus, who was Greek, and who was not a direct observer of this. So you might want to take all of this with a grain of salt, because it does make the Greeks look awfully good. But we do think that most of this happened, but obviously Herodotus probably added a little bit of bias there. We are likely to never know. So let's think about, or let's see what Xerxes attempts to do."
Social Studies,"So we see this magenta line. This is the line of attack of Xerxes in 480, and you can see, there's one magenta line that is going by sea, and one magenta line that is going by sea here, and another magenta line that is going by land. And let's zoom in a little bit more. I have another map here. So let's zoom in to this map right over here to give us a clearer picture of what's about to happen in this next Persian invasion."
Social Studies,"So just to reorient ourselves, here are the land forces, and according to Herodotus and historians of that time, they numbered this force in potentially millions of soldiers, modern historians think it was closer to 50 thousand to 300 thousand, we really don't know, but we think it's in the approximately hundred thousand, or a few hundred thousands, not millions, but by any measure, that is a huge, a huge military force. So this is hundreds of thousands right over here. So hundreds of thousands."
Social Studies,"Or let me write this. Hundreds of thousands, maybe between 50 and 300 thousand. They're coming this way, the Persian forces. And they also have a fleet of approximately 1,200 ships. Now the Persians really are not having good luck with weather whenever they try to attack Greece. They face a storm, and about a third of their fleet is destroyed."
Social Studies,"And so up here they are left with about, and these are all approximate, remember this happened over 2,000 years ago, roughly 2,500 years ago, so it's amazing that we know anything about it at all, and obviously we have to rely on Herodotus and whatever historical accounts we can find. So the Persians are invading by land and sea, and the Greeks have a strategy of let's try to stop them by land at Thermopylae, and stop them by sea at the Straight of Artemisium right over here."
Social Studies,"And there is some historical debate of was this a big, grand strategy to eventually try to defeat the Persians at Salamis, which eventually happens, or were they generally trying to stop them there, and because they couldn't, they had to retreat back to Salamis. As we'll see, that second narrative is what actually happens. Well I guess in some level, both of those narratives happen."
Social Studies,"That they are able to at least slow down the Persians at both of these places, and the Persians are eventually defeated at the Straight of Salamis. Now Thermopylae is the stuff of legends. It is, if you've ever seen the movie 300, it is about the 300 Spartan soldiers led by King Leonitus, along with roughly 7,000 other Greeks that they're able to collect to stop the Persians at Thermopylae."
Social Studies,"And Thermopylae, you're in this coastal area where there's a very limited area for this massive Persian army to be funneled through, and the Greeks are trying to stop them at the Pass of Thermopylae. And you can see that right over there. And, by Herodotus's accounts, they are actually quite successful because they are funneling that Persian army into a very narrow space, the Spartans along with the other Greeks are able to push back. And this is a massive outnumbering."
Social Studies,"Roughly 7,000 versus many tens or hundreds of thousands, but as Herodotus's accounts go, there was a traitor amongst the Greeks who would go to the Persians and show them another way around, and show them another way around. And so the Persians are essentially able to, not only get around the Greeks, but by surrounding them, are able to defeat the Greeks at Thermopylae and continue their march."
Social Studies,"And remember, they were able to get to Eretria before, 10 years before, but they really want to seek their revenge on Athens. And they are able to go to go Athens, but by the time they go there, they see that the town has been, for the most part, evacuated. That the Athenians, when they saw that the Persians were coming, they went to Salamis right over here. So even though Athens was sacked and destroyed, the Athenian people were not destroyed."
Social Studies,"Now simultaneous with Thermopylae, you had a naval battle happen in the Straight of Artemisium. And once again, even though there was about 600 Persian ships that were in this battle, there was on the order of about 200 or 300 Greek ships, so the Greeks were once again outnumbered, and they were able to slow down the Persians, but not stop them."
Social Studies,"And the Persians kept having bad luck, especially with these storms, because even we had these first ships get destroyed, they sent some 200 ships around Euboea, I'm probably not pronouncing it perfectly right here, but then they get destroyed by a storm."
Social Studies,"So now you have the ships that engaged the Greeks in the Straight of Artemisium, the Greeks pull back because they know they're outnumbered, and they essentially go in retreat, or what the Persians think are retreat, so the Persians follow the Greek fleet all the way back to the Straight of Salamis. And it's over there that the Greek fleet is able to plan a defeat of the Persian fleet."
Social Studies,"So you have the Persian fleet gets destroyed decisively at Salamis, you have the Persian army still in Athens is able to destroy Athens, but the Athenian people have not been destroyed, and so there's a question for Xerxes, what to do at this point."
Social Studies,"This is all in 480 BCE, and what Xerxes decides to do, he says hey I don't want to get stranded in Europe at the edge of my empire, and so Xerxes heads back, but he leaves some of his ground forces there, and they eventually face a decisive defeat at Plataea, right over here. And so that is the last significant threat of the Persians against the Greeks."
Social Studies,"From then there the Greco-Persian wars continue for the next several decades, for the next 20 or 30 years, but at that point it's more of the Greeks on the offensive, and this really is the beginning of the Golden Age of the Greek civilization.."
Social Studies,"You have Athens leading the Delian League in a fight against Sparta and their allies, which significantly weakens the city states."
Social Studies,"It ends with Athens losing, but all of the city states have been weakened, and it leaves them open to be conquered by the Macedonians, in particular Phillip of Macedonia, and then his son Alexander the Great is able to not just keep control of Greece, of the city states, but conquer Egypt and Persia and get all the way to modern day Afghanistan and Pakistan, but after his death, you then have his successors, and Greece falls under the Antigonid dynasty."
Social Studies,"But eventually as we get into the second and first century BCE, it goes under Roman control, and we've talked about this Classical period, all of the various contributions. We've talked about the contributions in philosophy, from people like Socrates, and Socrates's student Plato, and Plato's student Aristotle, but there were also significant contributions in mathematics."
Social Studies,"You have Pythagoras, who actually predates these philosophers, and he's most famous, especially to many of us, for his Pythagorean Theorem and a lot of mathematics and the foundations of a lot of geometry. But he and his followers, they were actually creating something of a mysticism, of a religion around mathematics, and even a philosophy that would later influence some of the other philosophers that we talk about, especially this ideal of ideal platonic forms."
Social Studies,"You can imagine, if you're studying perfect right triangles, there's no such thing as a perfect right triangle in the universe. These are ideas that we use in geometry, and other things in the universe are really just approximations of these, but to appreciate the philosophical side of Pythagoras, here are some quotes from him, or quotes ascribed to him. ""There is geometry in the humming of the strings. ""There is music in the spacing of the spheres."
Social Studies,"""Reason is immortal, all else mortal."" And you see even in the sixth century BCE this thread of Greek thinking, putting reason at a very high level, not just trying to explain everything with pure mysticism, although Pythagoras definitely was, and Pythagoreanism was definitely about mysticism, but it was mysticism that at the core had mathematics and geometry. But continuing on with significant mathematical contributions from ancient Greece, we have Euclid."
Social Studies,"We don't know all of the exact details of his birth and his death, but he is the Father of Modern Geometry, and as you can see in this map here, he didn't live in what we call Greece proper today. He lived in Alexandria, a city established by Alexander the Great, and this is during the Hellenistic Period where all of the territory, or most of the territory that had been conquered by Alexander the Great was still ruled by his successors."
Social Studies,"Egypt was ruled by Ptolemy, establishing the Ptolemaic dynasty in the time of Euclid, and Euclid lived in that great center of learning and the arts, Alexandria, which even exists today, and he is most famous for his Elements. This is a much later printing of his Elements, of Euclid's eEements, but you would be amazed how much of modern geometry has been described by Euclid. Even your geometry textbook can trace it back directly to Euclid's Elements."
Social Studies,"Abraham Lincoln famously learned every proof in Euclid's Elements in order to fine tune his mind. So you can really view Euclid as the Father of Geometry, but that's not all. There are many other contributors in philosophy and math, and this is just, once again, a sample of all of the folks who contributed. On the side of philosophy, you have Xenophon, who was another one of Socrates' students in addition to Plato, and in fact, the life of Socrates we learn from the writings of Plato and Xenophon."
Social Studies,"Xenophon was also a historian who gave us some accounts of the later Peloponnesian War. You have the famous cynics, Antisthenes and his student Diogenes, Diogenes, famous for living in a barrel in Athens, and somewhat insulting Alexander the Great. But these cynics, which the word is derived from being dog like, these are people who were philosophers who gave up the trappings of materialism and caring, frankly, what other people thought."
Social Studies,"As we go a little bit out of our timeline right over here, you have Archimedes, one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists of all time, but you also have contributions in the arts, some of the most famous playwrights of the ancient time, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides. Aristophanes, we might remember as being a bit of a thorn in the side of Socrates. He wrote about Socrates, but it was more of a parody. You have contributions in medicine, the famous Hippocrates."
Social Studies,"The Hippocratic Oath still has an influence on modern medicine. You have some of the earliest what we could say historians that we know of, Herodotus, famously giving us the accounts we have of the Greco-Persian Wars, a lot of what we even know about the ancient Persian Empire. You have Thucydides, who gives us accounts of the Peloponnesian War along with Xenophon. And so when you see this density of arts, sciences, learning in one place, a lot of this was centered in Athens."
Social Studies,"It makes you wonder what was going on at that time, and historians do call the period from when the Athenians were able to fend off the Persians all the way until the end of the Peloponnesian War as the Golden Age of Athens, and for good reason. Look at this flourishing of the arts and the sciences that developed during that period. You might wonder what was happening in terms of government, and government of this period might be one of the longest lasting influences."
Social Studies,"As we exit the sixth century BCE in 507, you have Greek Democracy taking root in Athens, and in fact, the word democracy is a Greek word, government by the people. And shortly after that, during the Golden Age of Athens, you start having leadership by Pericles. He was an orator. He was a statesman. He was a general. In this period right over here that I have in orange, often known as the Age of Pericles, he helped Athens invest significantly in the arts and in architecture."
Social Studies,"Some of the most iconic structures we now associate with Greece or ancient Greece were built during his time. They were promoted by him. Here you have a picture of the Acropolis, which is this rock outcropping, which still exists in Athens as it likely looked during the time of Pericles, during the Golden Age of Athens, and you can see here in particular the most famous structure. The Parthenon, a lot of which still stands today, was constructed under the rule of Pericles."
Social Studies,"As I mentioned, the Greek city states get conquered by the Macedonians, but after the death of Alexander the Great, falls under the control of the Antigonid dynasty, but eventually, as we get into the second century BCE, off of this timeline, it comes under Roman control, becomes part of the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"But the Roman Empire is itself significantly influenced by Greek culture, Greek mathematics, Greek architecture, Greek philosophy, and in a lot of ways, the Romans end up becoming the caretakers of much of this culture that we talk about in this video, and once you have the decline of the Roman Empire, especially the western Roman Empire, and Europe enters into the Middle Ages, you have the Islamic world that acts as a bit of a bridge of this Greek culture into the European Renaissance and eventually the Enlightenment."
Social Studies,"And so we can trace even our modern views of science and philosophy all the way back to these Greeks, and so I'll leave you with this quote from the Roman poet Horace who wrote this around the first century BCE. ""Captive Greece took captive her fierce conqueror ""and instilled her arts in rustic Latium,"" or Laecium."
Social Studies,"And so what he's saying is, even though Rome had conquered Greece, Greece's culture took captive her conqueror, took captive the Roman culture, instilled Greece's arts in the rustic Latin world.."
Social Studies,"And those are contributions in terms of forms of governance, like democracy, contributions in medicine, contributions in the arts, in mathematics, in the sciences. But perhaps their most famous contribution is in terms of philosophy. And if we're going to talk about philosophy in ancient Greece, the most famous three philosophers are Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle."
Social Studies,"Now, before we get into the first of them, and really the teacher of Plato, who was then the teacher of Aristotle, let's get a little bit of context on this time period. So, as we enter into the fifth century BCE, a couple of things are emerging. First, you have a new Athenian democracy. Then, as you get into that century, the Persians invade, try to conquer Greece several times, but unsuccessfully."
Social Studies,"But then, the Greeks start fighting amongst themselves, led on one side by Athens, on the other side by Sparta, and that's the Peloponnesian War, which ends with Sparta being victorious, but all of the Greek city states being weakened dramatically. Now, between the end, especially the first part of the Greco-Persian Wars, and the end of the Peloponnesian War, it was actually a time of Athenian prosperity."
Social Studies,"They were leading this semi-empire, they were investing in the arts, and it's often called the Golden Age of Athens, and that's the world in which Socrates emerged. Like many philosophers, Socrates led a very interesting life, and it's worth noting what we know about him does not come directly from his writing. We don't have surviving accounts of his writing. It comes mainly through the writing of his students, Xenophon, and, most notably, Plato."
Social Studies,"We also get some parody of Socrates from Aristophanes, that Socrates himself did not appreciate much. But what we know is that he started in life, he was a stone mason, he even acted as a soldier, a hoplite, during the Peloponnesian War. But he is, of course, most famous for being a philosopher and for being a teacher. And his teaching style, the Socratic method, is still viewed as something of a best practice today."
Social Studies,"Rather than lecturing students, to, instead, ask incisive questions that force a student to deepen their thinking and get closer to the root of an issue, and to learn how to think rather than just having knowledge transmitted to them. Now, what's also notable about Socrates and his many students, including Plato and Aristotle, is that they took a departure of how to think about the world from most of the ancient world."
Social Studies,"Most of the ancient world was focused on the gods and the metaphysical explaining everything. And, while the ancient Greeks did have a large pantheon of gods, Socrates and his fellow philosophers tried to figure out how the world works, why we are here, somewhat independent of the gods. They tried to reason it through, they tried to talk it through, think about it from a rational point of view. And to get a flavor of that, here is a quote."
Social Studies,"""True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize ""how little we understand about life, ourselves, ""and the world around us."" So, unlike many ancient societies that just tried to explain everything through the metaphysical or through the gods, here you have Socrates saying, no, an ideal true wisdom is when you appreciate how little we know, this form of intellectual humility. Now, Socrates lived during this Golden Age of Athens, a time when democracy was flourishing, the Age of Pericles."
Social Studies,"But he himself was a little bit skeptical of unfettered or pure democracy. He was worried, well, what if the people voting aren't educated to make the types of decisions? Maybe they can be manipulated by a demagogue, someone who just tells 'em exactly what they want to hear. And so he was a bit of a controversial figure, especially as you get to the end of the Peloponnesian War. Remember, Athens loses the Peloponnesian War."
Social Studies,"It went from being this powerful head of this Delian League, something of an empire, this wealthy city, and now it's a subjugated state, it's tired from war. And so you can imagine there's a lot of political infighting, and Socrates ends up being one of the casualties. He is actually put on trial by his fellow Athenians. This is a depiction of the trial of Socrates, and it shows Socrates defending himself from the accusations brought against him."
Social Studies,"Refusing to recognize the gods acknowledged by the state, importing strange divinities of his own, corrupting the young. And his defense, which both Xenophon and Plato write about, called The Apology, he's bewildered, he says, where is all of this coming from? Now, it is true, he did not invoke the gods when he's trying to explain the universe. And, yes, he was trying to teach the young to think."
Social Studies,"But by no means, if you look at what he was doing, or at least our modern accounts coming through Plato and Xenophon, does it seem like he was trying to undermine the state in some way. But, needless to say, it comes to a vote, and maybe he's a victim of his own fears of a pure democratic process, but, amongst the 500 Athenians voting, 280 say that he is guilty, and 220 say that he is not guilty. He is given a chance to think about what his penalty should be."
Social Studies,"And the charges, at least in the Athenian's minds, were quite serious. But Socrates famously says, ""An unexamined life is not worth living."" And so, even though many historians think that he might have been able to get exile if he asked for it, he was sentenced to death. And this is a painting done much, much later of what that death of Socrates might have looked like. But you see here Socrates about to, or maybe he just drank the hemlock, which is the poison which will kill him."
Social Studies,"So, even though he had to die for these pretty spurious allegations, his legacy lives on, and it lives on most famously in his student Plato. Now, Plato is famous for many things. There's this notion of a Platonic ideal form that, whether you're talking about a circle, or a ball, or a dog, or a chair, that there's an ideal form that is independent of what your senses are telling you, or what the chair in front of you might be, that that's an imperfect version of that ideal form."
Social Studies,"The word Platonic, in general, you'll hear applied to many different concepts, some of the meanings having changed over time. The other thing that Plato is famous for is the notion of an academy. The place where he taught his students was a little field outside the walls of Athens, named for the Athenian hero Akademos, and so that area became known as Plato's Academy. And ever since then, places of learning have often been referred to as academies, just like Khan Academy."
Social Studies,"But Plato was also concerned, like his teacher Socrates, with the nature of how we should be ruled. ""There will be no end to the troubles of states, ""or indeed of humanity itself, till philosophers ""become rulers in this world, or till those ""we now call kings and rulers really and truly ""become philosophers, and political power and philosophy ""thus come into the same hands."" So, like Socrates, he's weary of how they have been governed. And, remember, we're now after the period of the Peloponnesian War."
Social Studies,"The city states of Greece, especially Athens, have been dramatically weakened, so a lot of people might be thinking, including Plato, is there a better way to govern ourselves? Now, Plato's most famous student is Aristotle. And, like his teacher, Aristotle is famous for many things and explored many dimensions of the universe. But he is probably most famous for being the tutor of Alexander the Great when Alexander the Great was young."
Social Studies,"Phillip of Macedon, Alexander the Great's father, as he conquers the weakened city states after the Peloponnesian War, he also conquers Aristotle's home town of Stagira, and he enslaves the population. And so, when he goes to Aristotle to tutor his young son, who ends up being called Alexander the Great eventually, Aristotle says, okay, my fee will be free the people of my town."
Social Studies,"His town is freed, he tutors a young Alexander, when Alexander is in his early teens, and he also gets support for a center of learning. He creates a Lyceum, which is his version of Plato's Academy."
Social Studies,"And, just like you saw with Socrates and you see with Plato, Aristotle continued this tradition of a focus on learning and a humble acceptance of all that there might be in the world, this rationality that we now see in modern science, that you didn't see from a lot of the ancients, who were focused on the metaphysics and the gods."
Social Studies,"""It is the mark of an educated mind ""to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" And I'll leave you there, but the big takeaway is, going from Socrates, to Plato, to Aristotle, and there were many other Greek philosophers, you have the seed of what you could call modern rationality."
Social Studies,"Roughly 2,000 years later, you have the European Renaissance that starts reemerging many of these same ideas, all the way providing a bridge into the Enlightenment, and now our modern, hopefully fairly rational view of the world.."
Social Studies,"So at that point the Greeks, especially the city-states, the powerful city-states of Sparta and Athens, they're fighting on the same side. But as we'll see in this video this all starts to break down and they will eventually be at war with each other and a very ugly war."
Social Studies,"You know a lot of times when we think about these things thousands of years later it might seem somewhat romantic, the stuff of stories and adventures, but these things are ugly, people are getting killed, people are getting tortured, civilians are dying, whole cities are being destroyed."
Social Studies,"Now whenever we talk about history it's very important to think about where your story is coming from and you should always have a nice dose of doubt on what were the motivations of the person who wrote it or how much can they really know about things. And when we talked about the Persian invasions of Greece, or the Greco-Persian wars, that was coming to us from someone who is often known as the father of history, I guess that's a very Greco-centric perspective, but that is Herodutus."
Social Studies,"And now we're going to start getting our accounts from someone who wrote the famous history of the Peloponnesian War and that is Thucydides. And they're so closely linked, especially because they're giving history of essentially this fifth century BCE that this is actually a double bust of the two, Herodutus and Thucydides. So once again a lot of the story that I'm about to tell, is coming via Thucydides. So as soon as the Persians are, they've been defeated, they leave."
Social Studies,"You might remember that the Athenians had to escape to Salamis, that's where you also had the naval route of the Persian navy, and so the Athenians decide hey let's move back to Athens. And in deciding to move back to Athens, right over there, they say okay well we want to build a wall around Athens in case anyone else wants to invade us."
Social Studies,"And you might say okay maybe they are somewhat concerned about the Persians, but you could also argue that they are somewhat concerned about the Spartans who are famous for having this very powerful army. And so they start the construction on what's often called the long wall and it's a way for them to have access to the sea and to protect their city in the event of a siege."
Social Studies,"Now if you take the other side, if you think about what's going on in the minds of the Spartans, they are thinking okay you know for a long time we were really the dominant military power but what we've just seen with the Greco-Persian wars is this Athenian navy is actually quite strong and in some ways, in fact in a lot of ways you can argue that they are the ones that were able to beat off the Persians at Salamis. That the navy was essential there. So Sparta's feeling a little bit threatened."
Social Studies,"And in particular they don't like the idea of this wall because here you have the city-state Athens with this very strong navy, now they're building a wall. Sparta says hey if they have a wall it's going to be very hard for us if they don't do what, you know, if they start exerting too much influence, it's going to be hard for us to take down Athens. They instead suggest hey Athens why don't you build a wall at the Isthmus of Corinth, right over here. You might notice the geography of Greece."
Social Studies,"You have this little, I guess you could call it this little strip of land that connects the mainland I guess you could say, to this peninsula, this very large peninsula which is called Peloponnese, which is where Sparta is. And you could imagine that this is a very strategic location. Anyone who wants to conquer the Peloponnese by land is going to have to go through there."
Social Studies,"The Athenians are of course no, we care about protecting ourselves and so they start to build this wall to protect themselves which the Spartans already are not so happy about. Now the other thing that the Athenians do, they continue to build up their naval power. They see hey this is a very useful thing. They start connecting with a bunch of allies around the Aegean, some on islands, some on the coast of Anatolia over here. And they meet on this island of Delos which you can't see here."
Social Studies,"It's a very small island. And they all agree to contribute their shared navies and to contribute money in order to continue to fight off the Persians wherever they are. You know these Persians did this injustice to us. Now let's go on the offensive. And they form what is called the Delian League. Now once again Sparta is not so happy about this because more and more it becomes clear that this Delian League, Athens isn't just a participant in the Delian League, Athens is starting to run the Delian League."
Social Studies,"And when people try to drop out of the Delian League over time Athens starts to exert itself. So the Delian League is really starting more and more and more into an Athenian empire. So once again Athens proved itself, its navy proved itself to be very powerful in this war. Sparta's getting insecure. Athens doesn't listen to Sparta about this wall and decides to start building it. Sparta's feeling even more insecure."
Social Studies,"Athens is starting to create this Delian League which is really an Athenian empire, even more insecure. And it kind of gets a little bit more intense in 464. So there are some accounts that Sparta around this time was already planning to invade Athens. To say hey these folks are getting too powerful, let's just put them in their place. But at around that time, in 464, you have a major earthquake in Sparta. And so it demolishes large parts of the city."
Social Studies,"And when that earthquake happens, the Spartan Helots who I guess the best way you can view them, they are slaves and I encourage you to read more about them. They were treated horribly. And in Sparta the accounts are that there were seven of these Helots, of these slaves, for every Spartan. And so the Helots start a revolt and Sparta goes to the other city-states of Greece and says help us put down this revolt that happened right after our earthquake. And so Athens agrees."
Social Studies,"They send 4,000 citizen soldiers to Sparta. The citizen soldiers are famous Hoplites to help put down the revolt. But once again Sparta is feeling insecure. They say hey why did they send these soldiers. Maybe they say they want to put down this rebellion, but we Sparta we're at kind of a fairly vulnerable state right here, what if they Athenians took the side of the Helots. Well then they might be able to take over Sparta. So they send the Athenian Hoplites back."
Social Studies,"They said you know we don't need your help. And so you can imagine the Athenians now are starting to take significant offense to how the Spartans are treating them. And then you fast forward a little bit more to 459 BCE and you have two allies of Sparta, Megara and Corinth and they're right in this very strategic location, that little land, that land connection that land bridge between the mainland and the Peloponnese and there is a dispute between these two allies of Sparta, between Corinth and Megara."
Social Studies,And Athens decides to intervene and form an alliance with Megara. Well you can imagine you know this insecurity has been building up in Sparta for at this point over a decade and so it all comes to head and they start having skirmishes and they start essentially going to war with each other. They have these sporadic skirmishes over the next 15 years.
Social Studies,"And this period right over here from roughly 460 or 459, for the next 15 years, this is often referred to as the First Peloponnesian War because once again you have Sparta and its allies starting to get into all of these skirmishes with Athens and its allies. But this isn't the Peloponnesian War. The Peloponnesian War is going to come a little bit about 15 years later."
Social Studies,"The first Peloponnesian War that we were just talking about, that eventually ends what's called a 30 years peace, peace treaty which only lasts for 15 years. But the whole time the Athenians, their navy is growing more powerful, they keep getting in each others way and annoying each other and so the Peloponnesian War which we'll talk about in more detail will occur at the end of the fifth century BCE and it will conclude with Sparta being victorious. But in the process most of Greece is significantly hurt."
Social Studies,"And all of the city-states or the significant city-states of Greece are significantly weakened. And so that sets things up for the fourth century BCE where it leaves the city-states of Greece vulnerable to attack from the north, in particular Macedonia. And we'll see that actually several videos in the future.."
Social Studies,"And a lot of this you can imagine, it's like a game of Risk. The more you take over, the more resources you have, the more that you can build more ships and have more soldiers so that you can take on even more. So as Sparta and Athens are starting to become more and more rivals, Sparta's getting insecure about Athens' influence and their resources, and their military power."
Social Studies,"And we even saw it in the last video, you have an earthquake in Sparta, potentially right around the same time that Sparta was planning an invasion of Athens, leaving the Spartans vulnerable. There's a Helot uprising, these Spartan slaves. The Athenians send Hoplites to apparently help the Spartans but the Spartans are suspicious of it and they send them back."
Social Studies,"And then it culminates with the skirmish you have between Megara and Corinth, which were historically two Spartan allies, but Athens decides to take sides, gets an alliance with Megara, and that's one thing too many for the Spartans, and so they declare war, and you have what's called the First Peloponnesian War. But that's not the Peloponnesian War, that's the first time that you start having very open conflict between the Spartans and the Athenians."
Social Studies,"And these conflicts last for, on the order of about 15 years, and they're ended with what's called the Peace of 30 Years. But as we will see, this Peace of 30 Years only lasts about 15 years. And the whole time, tensions continue to arise. The Delian League, or you could call it the Athenian power, the Athenian empire I should say, is getting more and more powerful. The Athenian Navy is getting more and more powerful."
Social Studies,"And once again, things culminate, and now this is the beginning of the actual Peloponnesian War, the thing that people are referring to when they talk about the Peloponnesian War. In 431 BCE, the King of Sparta is convinced or is, I guess you could say he is influenced to, even though he himself was somewhat skeptical of the idea, he decides to invade Attica. Attica's something you'll hear a lot about. It is this region right over here, this little out-jutting of land, that Athens is on."
Social Studies,"And this first phase of the Peloponnesian War is called the Archidamian War, named for the King of Sparta who somewhat reluctantly decides to invade Attica. And so that's stage one, Archidamian War. And the Archidamian War, its essential ingredients are you have Sparta with its dominant army going and having repeated attacks onto Attica, and the Athenians with their dominant navy going and having raids throughout the Peloponnese and along the Aegean Coast."
Social Studies,"So here you have the Athenians, let me do the Athenians and the Spartans in two different colors, actually. So here you go. Let's do the Spartans in this red color, attacking Attica with their army, and now let's have the Athenians with this light blue color coming here and attacking various points, various points on the Peloponnese and in the Aegean, further extending their influence."
Social Studies,"Now that first phase ends, and it goes on for quite a bit, it goes on for about 10 years, ends with the Peace of Nicias, but as you will see and that was actually intended to be a 50-year peace, but you'll see it doesn't last long at all. The skirmishes continue, and in 415, the Athenians say hey, we want to extend our power."
Social Studies,"Remember, it's like this game of Risk, the more city-states you take over, the more citizens that you're able to tax, the more soldiers you will have, the more wealth you will have, the more shipbuilding capability you will have. So the Athenians get this great idea to sail all the way to Syracuse and just to be clear where Syracuse is, Syracuse is over here on the coast of Sicily. Now this is a long distance in this ancient world."
Social Studies,"They get this idea to sail all the way to Syracuse to try to take it over, and essentially to extend their empire. So this right over here is in 415, this long voyage to take over Syracuse, and it is disastrous. The fleet that tries to go is able to be destroyed, and they get the folks in Syracuse are able to get the assistance of the Spartans, and so that Greek fleet is destroyed. And this is often viewed as the second phase of the Peloponnesian War. And so this is the Attack at Syracuse."
Social Studies,"Attack at Syracuse, the failed attempt of the Athenians to get Syracuse, to get Syracuse. And this is a two-year period of time, because once again, this is no joke to send your navy and to try to get at Syracuse. And then that takes us into the third phase, the third phase of the Peloponnesian War, let me scroll this over a little bit. The third phase is often called the Ionian War. Ionian War. Ionia is this region that's now in modern day, off the coast of modern-day Turkey."
Social Studies,"You have many of the city-states that were part of this Athenian empire, they're starting to revolt. You can imagine that the Spartans are trying to help those revolts because they're trying to get the Athenians wherever they are. This is often also called the Decelean War. Decelea, I'm probably not pronouncing it well, is a little village right over here at the top of Attica, and it was a strategic location that went over to the Spartans and that's where the Decelean War gets its name."
Social Studies,"But over the course of this third phase, the Spartans get help from the Persians. Remember this was their enemy, they had unified the Spartans and Athenians had unified against the Persians, but some time has passed. We're now 70 or 80 years later, and the Spartans say hey, we want to win this thing decisively."
Social Studies,"They get the help of the Persians and finally in 405 BCE there's decisive naval battle at Aegospotami, and I'm sorry to all of you Greeks out there that might be listening, I know my pronunciation is not perfect or close to perfect, but this is a decisive victory right over here for the Spartans."
Social Studies,"They're able to destroy the Athenian Navy, and that causes, that's the decisive victory, and then in 404, this is in 405, in 404, the Athenians surrender and the famous Peloponnesian War is over, the Spartans are victorious. But it's not a great victory because as you can imagine, you have towns that have been destroyed, large parts of Greece have been weakened, and it leaves the whole area open to attack from others."
Social Studies,"And as we will see in the next century, in the 4th century, we have Phillip of Macedon, or Macedon depending on how you want to pronounce it, who's able to use that vulnerable, and the Macedonians or the Macedonians they are related to the Greek people, but he's able to use that vulnerability that happens over the course of the 5th century to attack the city-states of Greece, but he actually is able to unify them.."
Social Studies,"One group has control over another group that might have different linguistic practices, different culture, that's when it is considered an empire. Well what's the general framework for how empires tend to form? Well let's say that I am a ruler and I control this territory right over here and either through my charisma, my military tactics, maybe I have a new weapon, some political intrigue, some weak neighbors, I'm able to conquer some more territory right over here."
Social Studies,"What does that do for me? As I expand, this gives me more land and more people to rule over and I can tax that land and people to have more wealth and larger armies and so these two things are pretty good ingredients to be able to take on even more of my neighbors and expand even further."
Social Studies,"And so you might say well, why doesn't that process just keep on going on indefinitely? Well it does go pretty far, you see these various empires are quite large especially when you consider the technology of the time, the communications ability of the time but at some point, you might have weak leadership, you might have trouble controlling these large and spread out empires especially if you can't communicate, if you can't get good information."
Social Studies,"But now let's dive a little bit deeper into the four empires we just referred to. So let's start Achaemenid Persia, founded in 550 BCE by Cyrus the Great. This is so far in the past that most of our accounts of how Cyrus comes to power come from the Greeks who were not friends with the Persians, they were famous rivals, but one thing comes clear in the narrative, which is that Cyrus the Great was considered a very strong and effective leader so I'll definitely put leadership there."
Social Studies,"He starts off as a relatively minor king subject to you could say the emperor of Medes, who is his grandfather, and he's able to overthrow him but because of his military leadership, his ability to bring people into the fold, he was known as being tolerant of the people he would rule over, that that all helped him control and expand a large empire. So I would say leadership is definitely first for Cyrus the Great and then I would say culture would be part of it. Now let's think about Maurya, India."
Social Studies,"Maurya, India was founded by Chandragupta Maurya and here once again, I would say leadership was a major factor, he was aided by his political advisor Chanakya who is famous in Indian history for his strategic thinking. Chandragupta Maurya, legend has it, met Alexander the Great when he came into the Indus but once Alexander the Great left, there was a power vacuum. You could say that that power vacuum helped the Maurya Empire be founded."
Social Studies,"It's similar to the notion of having weaker neighbors once Alexander the Great left. And so Han China, Han China is interesting."
Social Studies,"The first emperors of Han China aren't the ones to first unify China, that happens under the Qin Dynasty, Q-I-N, Qin Dynasty that preceded the Han Dynasty and they were able to do that by being very strong, very authoritarian, very centralized but once the Qin emperor dies, it leaves a clear power vacuum and then you have a succession battle but eventually the Han Dynasty is formed."
Social Studies,"One of the ways that the Han Dynasty is able to keep power despite not being as authoritarian as the Qin is that they revitalized Confucianism and used that ideology and used that culture in order to more unify the Chinese people. The Roman empire we study in some detail. It's hard to pin a date on exactly when it becomes an empire. On this timeline, this first period right over here is when we have the Roman kingdom, then you have the Roman Republic, and then you have the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"And so you could debate when it actually becomes an empire, even when it was an early kingdom, it was conquering neighboring people on the Italian peninsula and at that time period, it might have felt like an empire because those people might have felt different. As time passed and they were under a unified state, under a unified kingdom, they probably felt more similar but then when they conquered even more territory, that might have felt more and more like an empire."
Social Studies,"But what is clear is even as we get into the late republic period, it was an empire. Julius Caesar famously conquered Gaul, these Germanic peoples, before coming back and essentially taking control to be succeeded by the first official Roman Empire after a long and bloody civil war, Augustus Caesar. These other three empires happened relatively quickly, we're talking within a period of less than 50 years while the Roman Empire took hundreds of years to form."
Social Studies,"And so it's hard to ascribe the empire to any one leader. You could say that there was a culture of expansion, one could make the argument that they were more technologically sophisticated than some of their neighbors, especially when it came to military might and as it expanded, it definitely was able to take advantage of weak neighbors so now let's just take a step back. What we've done in this exercise is a rough approximation of the various dimensions that might lead to an empire rising."
Social Studies,"It's by no means comprehensive and I suggest for you to think about what dimensions would you add to this? Maybe you could add a political dimension or maybe that's captured by leadership. Maybe you would add an economic dimension, how much wealth a nation has. And as we go forward in history, we're gonna see different weights on these different dimensions for how important they are for empire formation."
Social Studies,"Especially as we get closer and closer to modern times, technology increases as a factor in terms of creating an empire. Ideology plays a significant role in empires based on religion but we also have empires based on economic ideology, communism versus capitalism. And on political ideology."
Social Studies,"And does an empire have to be strict control? Can you have a cultural empire without necessarily having direct control over people? So I will leave you with these questions, they're fascinating questions to think about within the context of these empires but also as we study all of world history.."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Let's start in Achaemenid Persia. So, Achaemenid Persia, it's an empire that lasts for roughly 200 years. And I guess the obvious thing about Achaemenid Persia, it gets taken over by Alexander the Great. So I'll just go ahead and throw invasion on that list for Achaemenid Persia. So, outside of invasion, if we go through the rest of this list, it clearly was a large empire, so maybe there was an element of over expansion. It was governed in a fairly federated way through these satraps."
Social Studies,"You might have had bad leadership be a role. Darius III, famous for deserting his troops on the battlefield. - [Steve] Yeah, and on top of that, we might throw in economics as well, because as Alexander conquers bits and pieces of the empire, he's also depriving them of the resources that those areas would provide. - [Sal] So, now let's move on to Maurya India. Once again, a significant empire, lasts definitely over 100 years and it's actually the largest unified empire over the Indian subcontinent."
Social Studies,"And it starts with three fairly strong rulers and it's known, especially with Ashoka the Great, for spreading of the Buddhist religion. So why, in your mind, Steve, did it fall? Which of these factors played most strongly? - [Steve] Well, the first one that jumps out is over expansion. Once Ashoka dies, you see the empire really lose a lot of that northwestern territory. What we did see is some religious strife."
Social Studies,"You mentioned that Ashoka worked really hard to spread Buddhism and he did follow that in some of his policies which led to some tension between some of the Hindu population in the empire. - [Sal] And so you could also call that division as well. So, moving on. Go to Han China. It began to fall the end of the second century CE and then falls in the third century CE. Which of these factors led to its eventual demise? - [Steve] Right."
Social Studies,So I think we want to start looking at the fall of Han China from the lens of the Yellow Turban Rebellion. And that is partly a religious movement and it also is partly sparked by environmental factors leading to food shortages. - [Sal] And food shortages might affect the economy. - [Steve] Absolutely. And there's a lot of internal migration to look for better jobs within Han China because of this. - [Sal] Do you think leadership played a role? - [Steve] Yeah.
Social Studies,"There was a lot of dissatisfaction with the Han emperor and how he was sort of dealing with some of these problems. And over time, efforts to defeat the rebellion led to regional warlords gaining more power and then they eventually carve out their own kingdoms from the Han domain. - [Sal] Okay. And then, overlapping in time with Han China, we of course have the famous Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"And on my timeline here, this first section is the Roman kingdom, then Roman republic, and then you have the formal Roman empire that collapses at the end of the fifth century. So which of these factors do you think played... In the Western Roman empire is collapsed, the Byzantine empire, the Eastern Roman empire continues on for roughly a thousand years more. - [Steve] Well, let's start with the obvious point there that there is a division."
Social Studies,"There's a formal political division that's gonna weaken both halves of the empire in terms of the resources available. We also have, at the same time as that division, religious issues going on. We have Christianity being declared the official religion of the Roman empire at this time and that leads to internal conflicts between those who are Christians and those who are not. - [Sal] You have migrations and invasions."
Social Studies,"You have famously the Huns migrating into Eastern Europe and then putting pressure on the Germanic tribes to oftentimes come into the Roman empire, but that led to... So that was both migrations and invasion. - [Steve] Yeah, and in this case, it's sometimes hard to separate invasion from migration. - [Sal] And I would throw in economy since the Roman empire, in its expansionary period, was constantly getting new territory which would add tax revenues to Rome's coffers."
Social Studies,"It allowed for more and more slaves who could work for Rome. Once you get into the third, fourth century CE, that expansion starts to stop and so it stops that ever-growing pile of money and ever-growing pile of labor. So, I'd argue economy played a role. You can never point to just one factor. Empires are these very complicated things but there are these general themes and as a student, it's valuable to think about them in a framework something like this."
Social Studies,"- [Steve] So all these factors won't apply to every single empire you look at. They're a good starting point when you start thinking about those questions of why did this particular empire fall? - [Sal] Awesome. Thanks, Steve. - [Steve] Thanks, Sal.."
Social Studies,.
Social Studies,"Diadochi translates into successors, and these are the various leaders, and mainly generals, of Alexander who then fought for control of the empire. It's a very bloody period, a lot of different Diadochi going after each other, or after each other's families, and what eventually happens over the next few decades is Alexander's empire, the empire that he establishes, gets split up into a few major empires."
Social Studies,"What you see on this map here, you see most of Persia, and the Anatolian Peninsula right over here, really the bulk of the old Achaemenid Persian Empire. It gets under control of Seleucus, and he establishes the Seleucid dynasty, the Seleucid Empire. Let me write this down right here. This is Seleucid, so the Seleucid Empire. Egypt right over here, this gets taken control of another general of Alexander, Ptolemy, and he establishes the Ptolemaic Empire and the Ptolemaic dynasty. Ptolemaic."
Social Studies,"And then Macedon ends up under control once again of another Diadochi, remember the Diadochi are the successors, all of these characters right over here. These are three of the various Diadochi, three of the more successful Diadochi right over here. But what the Macedonian components of Alexander's Empire, for the most part, end up under the control of Antigonus's dynasty, which ends up being called the Antigonid dynasty. Antigonid."
Social Studies,"And this, and as you can see, it's not all of the empire Alexander established. What we have in red here, these are independent states that did not get subsumed into the Seleucid, the Ptolemaic, or the Antigonid Empires, You can imagine, over the next several hundred years, they're going back and forth, there's an ebb and flow of control of these various empires, but these are the three most significant, especially the Ptolemaic and the Seleucid."
Social Studies,"What this establishes is what a lot of historians refer to as a new period of especially this part of the world. When we go from shortly before the Persian invasions of Greece all the way to Alexander the Great, we refer to that as Classical Greece, but now we're going from Classical Greece, with the death of Alexander in the beginning of the Wars of the Diadochi for control, this sets up a new period, often referred to by historians as Hellenistic Period."
Social Studies,"And the Hellenistic Period is referring to the fact that all of this territory that was conquered by Alexander the Great, and later gets split after the Wars of the Diadochi between these Diadochi establishing these various empires, they had huge influence of Greek culture. You had ruling dynasties that were essentially Greek, whether you're in Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Persia, or Antigonid Macedonia. Obviously the Macedonians were already a very strong Greek culture."
Social Studies,"And it's a time where you have the spread of the culture, you have a bit of fulfillment of Alexander the Great's goal of creating this very, this mashup, so to speak, of the various cultures of the region, the Greco, and the Persian, and the Egyptian cultures. Now the Hellenistic Period starts to end as each of these various empires get overthrown. The Seleucid Empire, in the third century BCE, it gets more and more overtaken by the Parthian Empire."
Social Studies,"Parthia starts as a satrap, a region, of the Seleucid Empire, but it eventually takes control over much of Persia. So this is the Parthanian, sorry, the Parthian Empire, right over here. And the last vestiges of the Seleucid Empire are eventually defeated by the Roman legions, and you'll see this is a common trend here because, at the time of Alexander, on the Italian peninsula, you start having a city-state that's becoming more and more powerful, and more and more of an empire."
Social Studies,"And as we will see, it starts to subsume a lot of the regions we talked about. Ptolemaic Egypt, it gets overthrown by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE, and the Antigonid dynasty gets overthrown by the Roman Empire, they're actually the first to get overthrown by the Roman Empire, in 168 BC."
Social Studies,"So this period, this Hellenistic Period, the takeaway, it's a period, I'm talking about hundreds of years in a matter of five or six minutes, but this is a period where you had significant Greek influence over a very large period, or a very large area of land, and it eventually ends with a lot of the western portions falling under Roman control, and the eastern portions, especially Persia, falling under Parthian control.."
Social Studies,"Names like Julius Caesar and Augustus might come to mind. You might think of some of the famous architectures. Some of which you can still see if you were to visit Rome, and these are all real images of Rome, or they're appropriately associated with it, and we'll talk about most of these things in some depth, but Rome did not start out that way, and the purpose of this video is to give us a over arching arc of the history of Rome to be able to place it within history. Both in terms of time and geography."
Social Studies,"So just to make sure we can read what I did here ahead of time, up here is I have a high level timeline and then down here I have a timeline that zooms in a little bit, goes into a few more details, and you can see this timeline on top, it's going from the eighth century BCE all the way to the fifth century CE, so it's covering over 1,000 years of history, and I need it to cover over 1,000 years of history because the Roman Empire, we can even say just the western Roman Empire covers that much, and that doesn't even cover the entire legacy of the Roman Empire because when we get into the fourth century CE, you have a split where you have the eastern and the western Roman Empire and the eastern, often known as the Byzantine Empire, that goes on until 1453 CE."
Social Studies,"So another 1,000 years until they are conquered by the Ottomans. So the legacy of the Roman Empire, even formally as an empire, is significant, and then it continues on. Much of western civilization, especially Europe and the Mediterranean has its foundations in the Roman Empire and then before that, Greek civilization, and the Roman Empire is really up there alongside the Persian Empire as one of the really great civilizations or empires, and when I say great, you should take that with a grain of salt."
Social Studies,"Great I'm saying it was big, it was powerful, but not everything they did was great. They had a lot of slavery, they were very cruel, they were sometimes very violent. So take these terms great with a grain of salt. So now that we get this timeline up here and then down here I'm gonna go, whoops."
Social Studies,"Down here I have some maps that are gonna show how the Roman Empire grew and then eventually splits and declines, but as we go to this top timeline, we see the founding of Rome in the eighth century BCE, and this date 753 is the date that's often given to the founding of Rome by Romulus, one of twin brothers Romulus and Remus raised by a she-wolf. They were abandoned and raised by the she-wolf as legend would have it, and then Romulus eventually kills his brother and then becomes the first king of Rome."
Social Studies,"We don't know how much of this is true. I suspect a lot of this is very legendary. Legend would have it that Rome is named for Romulus, but some historians today think well it might have been the other way around."
Social Studies,"We have the city of Rome, they needed a founding story, hey let's say this person Romulus started it, and we don't know the exact date, but there seems to be a reasonable consensus that around this mid eighth century BCE you have the founding of the city of Rome, but it's important to realize that at that point the founding of the city that the kingdom of Rome, it wasn't a significant power on the Italian Peninsula at the time."
Social Studies,"Where I have this X marked, that's where Rome is, and what you see in green, this is actually the Etruscan civilization, and for most of this period of the Roman kingdom. So this period right over here, it's actually the Etruscans that are dominant power and for significant fractions of this they were dominant over the Roman kingdom. Over the city of Rome, but as we get to 509 BCE, this is when the Roman Republic is established and in this blue green color, this is the kingdom."
Social Studies,"The gold color, this yellow color is the republic and then the red color is when the empire gets established by Julius Caesar and his adopted son Augustus, and as we get into this, I guess you could say this republic period of, or into the Roman Republic. This is when it starts to really exert itself as more of a dominant influence in the region, and it continues to be a dominant influence in the region for several hundred years, and then as we get into the first several hundred years in the common era."
Social Studies,"So after the time of Jesus. As we get into the 200s, the 300s, this is when we start to see a real decline of the Roman Empire and the western empire at least gets sacked multiple times in the fifth century, and the year 476 is what's typically given for the end of the Roman Empire, but even that's not exactly the end of the Roman Empire, because in the fourth century you have the Roman Empire splitting into this eastern and western empires, and the eastern later gets known as the Byzantine Empire."
Social Studies,"That goes on for another 1,000 years until it's, as I mentioned, I think earlier, taken over by the Ottomans, but to get more appreciation for how the Roman Empire grew and then eventually starts to shrink, I have some maps over here. So this first map, this is roughly from the third century BCE and third century BCE you might remember Rome is a republic at this time, but it's not the dominant power in the Mediterranean."
Social Studies,"Just to give ourselves some bearings, you might remember that in the later fourth century BCE that's when Alexander conquers much of, or most of Greece, Macedonia, the Persian Empire. Which included at the time Egypt, and as we get into the third century BCE, you still have the fragments of Alexanders empire, but these are still significant powers in the regions. You also have the Carthaginian Empire."
Social Studies,"Which you see here in blue in North Africa and southern Spain, and this period you have a series of wars between the Romans and the Carthaginians known as the Punic Wars, and we'll do videos in depth on the Punic Wars. They're called the Punic Wars because the term Punic, it comes from what the Romans called the Phoenicians, and Carthage was actually settled, founded by ancient Phoenicians."
Social Studies,"So you can kinda consider this the Phoenician War or the descendants of the Phoenician Wars, but that's why it's called Punic, but the Romans eventually win the multiple rounds of Punic Wars, take over their territory, and eventually destroy Carthage. Carthage is destroyed in 146 BCE, and we'll talk about that in more detail."
Social Studies,"Now as we go into the first century BCE, this is when Rome goes form being a republic to an empire, and it happens when the general, Julius Caesar, he's able to conquer Gaul for the Roman Republic."
Social Studies,"So Gaul is modern day France and some other surrounding regions, and he is so powerful that when he comes back to Rome, a civil war ensues and Julius Caesar is able to essentially win the civil war, declare himself a dictator, and then his adopted son Augustus, right over here, is in 27 BCE declared Emperor, and that's the beginning of the Roman Empire, and we keep going, and I think I've already mentioned it once in this video, but eventually we get a split in the fourth century CE where we have eastern and western halves of the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"The western side centered at Rome, the eastern side centered at what was originally Byzantium, renamed Constantinople, and today Istanbul, and as we get into the fifth century, that's when the western empire especially starts to really go into decline and is eventually sacked in 476, but the eastern empire keeps on going.."
Social Studies,"Most historians don't accept that founding myth. But then it became they overthrew their last king in 509 BCE, Tarquin the Proud, and then they established the Roman republic, which was eventually then turned into an empire by Julius Caesar and Augustus. And so, whenever you have something this long lasting, you could imagine the social and the political structures evolved over time."
Social Studies,"But let's begin with the period when it was a kingdom, because even then there were some things that were noteworthy and some social and political structures that continued into the republic period and even when it was an empire. So one interesting thing is that when we typically think of kings, we think of it as being dynastic, that if I am king, then my oldest son, or maybe in certain cultures, my oldest daughter might become king or queen."
Social Studies,"But turns out, that many of the, especially the early kings of the Roman kingdom, were actually elected. They had a lot of power, all the power resided in them, they were the executive, the legislative, they were the judicial, they even had religious power. But it's interesting to think of the idea of elected kings. Now all of them weren't elected. Several of them were dynastic but it is an interesting idea. Now another idea that emerged during the Roman kingdom is this idea of citizenship."
Social Studies,"Now it's important to realize today, in a lot of countries, we think of oh, everyone who's a formal resident of that country, you can view them as a citizen, or most of the people, you could think of citizens, especially maybe people born in a country. But that was not the case in Rome. And when we go into this Roman kingdom, I'll remind, and I do this in many videos, we're not thinking about this sprawling Roman empire that we'll see several hundred years later."
Social Studies,"At that time, Rome was really just in control of Rome and over time, especially during the republic period, it starts to expand and eventually have hegemony or dominant power over the Mediterranean or parts of the Middle East, I should say, and in southern Europe. But let's go back to this kingdom period. And what I'm about to draw actually stays true through most of Roman civilization. If this white circle are the people who lived under Roman rule, only a subset were citizens. So this were the citizens."
Social Studies,"These were male landowners, citizens right over here. And within the citizens, they were further divided between patricians, and you can think of them as the nobility, these were people and they became patrician based on what family they were born into. And it's based on this idea and the word literally comes from this idea that you are descended from the founding fathers of Rome. And then all the other citizens were the plebians. So all of the other ones were the plebians, right over here."
Social Studies,"And, as we'll see, over the patricians held most of the power and most of the wealth for a significant amount of time. But as we go through the republic period, the plebians start to gain more and more and more power and many plebians also start to accrue wealth and some patrician families do end up poor. But, for the most part, the patricians, they're the nobility, they're associated with the aristocracy, but the plebians, some of them become wealthy and powerful as well."
Social Studies,"Now you're probably saying what about all of these other people? Well, you could imagine non-landholding males, you could imagine women, you could imagine slaves. And even though we aggrandize Rome and there were many very interesting things about Rome, one of the legacies that Rome had, which maybe as the historians reflect a little bit more negatively on, is that Roman society was built on the idea of slaves."
Social Studies,"And most of the slaves were people that they subjugated people that they conquered in other lands. They might have been people who at least the authorities thought they committed a crime of some kind. But the society was built on slavery. So you had a large segment of the population that had no rights, that were considered slaves. Later on, they start to gain some very, very basic, rudimentary rights, but you can imagine, as a slave, close to no rights whatsoever."
Social Studies,"Now, other institutions that developed during the time of the Roman kingdom were an institution that developed at the time of the Roman kingdom was the Senate, was the Roman Senate. And under the king, the king had most of the power, but once the Roman republic gets established, it's actually the Senate where most of the power resides. Now, this right over here, is a depiction, that came much later, of the Roman Senate."
Social Studies,"And it's important to realize that the Senate was not the only institution or the only position within the Roman republic. The consuls were there and you could view the consuls as the executives, or if you think of a system like the United States, the executive power resides in the President, so it's analogous to the President. They are running the government. They are also commander in chief of the military. Now, consuls, even though it was considered a very high title, their power was very limited."
Social Studies,"There was two of them at any given time, so I just drew the two consuls. They could veto each other at any given time to keep any one consul from getting too powerful and they only had a one year term. And during that one year, they would alternate on a monthly basis on who was the more senior consul. So you could imagine the consuls were limited in many, many, many ways."
Social Studies,"And even though the Senate officially was supposed to advise the consuls, in practice, what the Senate told the consuls to do, the consuls actually did. So another question is, well, who gets to be a consul and who gets to be a Senate? Well, in the early days, the Senate was mainly or it was patrician, and over time, as plebians start to exert more and more power, especially as we go into the mid and later republic, Roman republic, you start to have more wealthy plebians in the Senate."
Social Studies,"But in general, the Senate is composed of the aristocracy. So wealthy and influential men of Rome are in the Senate. How are they selected for the Senate? Well, in the early days, it was actually the consuls who selected the Senators. Later on, or shortly thereafter, and for most of the republic period of Rome, it was a position called the censor that decided who got to actually serve in the Senate."
Social Studies,"Now another question you might say is well, who's deciding who gets to be a consul, who gets to be a censor, and there's many other of these executive positions that are generally called magistrates, and that came from one of the assemblies of the Roman republic, in particular, the Centuriate assembly. Centuriate assembly, which elected consuls, the senior executives, the senior magistrates, is one way that you could think about it, they elected them."
Social Studies,"And who was in the Centuriate assembly and why did they call it the Centuriate assembly? Well, it started off as citizen soldiers being grouped into groups of 100 and on a particular issue, including who should be elected consul, this group of 100 would vote, whatever the majority would be, then their representative to the assembly would vote that way. So they wouldn't just select a representative and that representative could do anything they want."
Social Studies,"They would tell that representative how to vote, but that's why it was called a Centuriate assembly, because you had these groups of 100. And a lot of their power was in electing these consuls and these other senior magistrates. But that wasn't the only assembly. You also had the tribunal assembly. This is breaking up the Roman population, the Roman citizenry, by tribe. And this had both plebians and patricians in it. So this is the tribunal assembly."
Social Studies,"You also have the Plebian Council, this was only plebians. You also have the Plebian Council. And even though, all of these, and they evolved over time. Over time, the plebians started to get more and more power, the general idea, especially during the Roman republic, is that the Senate is where the important debates on foreign policy happened, the important debates on what Rome should become as a society, as a republic, and eventually as an empire.."
Social Studies,"Rome is a militaristic society. The Roman legions start to exert it's influence over more and more of the surrounding people on the Italian Peninsula. We keep going several hundred years until we enter into the 3rd century BCE. This is a map of what the Mediterranean, at least, looks like roughly as we enter into that 3rd century BCE. You see, even though that Rome has now exerted it's power over most of the Italian Peninsula right over here, it was not the dominant power in the Mediterranean."
Social Studies,"It was really the upstart, the new and growing empire. There are other significant empires. You see here the remnants of Alexander the Great's empire, his successors each now with their own significant empire, and in particular, Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Persia, which had control over much of the Middle East. The other empire that you see here in blue was the Carthaginian Empire."
Social Studies,"As we will see in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, Rome and Carthage are going to come at loggerheads, and Rome, eventually, is going to overthrow Carthage as the dominant empire in the Mediterranean. But you can see in this map right over here, entering into the 3rd century BCE, Carthage, that you see in blue, was a significant empire. So the question is, who were these Carthaginians? The answer is is that they were Phoenicians."
Social Studies,"Another answer is, even the Phoenicians did not call themselves Phoenicians, but to understand where all of this came from, we have to go back 5,000 years ago. 5,000 years before, roughly 5,000 years before now, around 3,000 BCE, where you have these city-states like Tyre and Sidon. I don't know if you can see those well. Let me rewrite it. That is Tyre, this is Sidon."
Social Studies,"Now, this map is obviously a map of the 3rd century BCE, but if you go back to when these cities were founded, in fact, before they were, I guess you can say, put under the influence of Nebuchadnezzar and then accumulated Persia, these were independent city-states. They're actually existing cities in modern day Lebanon. In this region, then, the leading cities were Tyre and Sidon. You had a group of people that would later be known as the Phoenicians. The Phoenicians were famous for many things."
Social Studies,"They were famous as traders, as really ship builders, and traders. And they colonized much of, or large segments, of the coastline of the Mediterranean. This is going back thousands and thousands of years. Carthage was one of those colonies. It was established in the 9th century, this is what modern day historians believe, sometime between 846 and 813 BCE. It was a Phoenician colony, it was set up as, really, a trading post for the Tyrians, right over here."
Social Studies,"The reason why they're called Phoenicians, they didn't call themselves Phoenicians, these Phoenician people, they were called that by the Greeks and later the Romans, because they were famous for trading their purple dye. They had their purple dye, which was derived from mollusk mucous that they were able to get from the sea, as great sea traders and ship builders."
Social Studies,"They had this purple dye, and the term for this purple dye, it was related to the word phoinikes, or pho-ni-cian, and I know I'm not pronouncing it well. The Greeks and the Romans of the time called them the Phoenician people for their purple dye. Now, Carthage, as we will see in probably the next video, Carthage has a series of wars with Rome, which are called the Punic Wars."
Social Studies,"I've always wondered, where does that term Punic come from? Why isn't it called the Carthaginian Wars, or the Roman-Carthaginian Wars? And that's because the Carthaginians were referred to their origins as coming from Phoenicia. The Latin term for that was poenicus, once again, related to the Greek word for that purple dye. So poenicus became punic, so the idea of Phoenician, these are all related words to each other."
Social Studies,"When we're talking about the Punic Wars, these are the Romans, or this is the modern day English. The Romans would have said poenicus. These wars were referring to the wars with Carthage, who were descendant from the Phoenicians. Now, just as a side note, another thing that you might be wondering about is, hey, this word, Phoenician, it looks familiar. It looks like phonetic, like the phonetic alphabet."
Social Studies,"That was the other famous contribution of the Phoenicians, is that our alphabet, the idea of our alphabet, was derived from the Phoenetic alphabet of the Phoenicians. The Phoenicians did many, many, many things. They settled much, they were one of the real naval powers of the Mediterranean going back thousands, and thousands of years."
Social Studies,"By the time we get to the Middle Roman Republic, we're in the 3rd century BCE, we're in the 200s BCE, the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon, they're now part of the Seleucid Empire. The Seleucid Empire was one of the successor empires of Alexander the Great, but their offspring, so to speak, Carthage, is now a dominant power in the Mediterranean. With Rome starting to exert it's might, although it has very powerful armies, it does not, at this point, have a very powerful navy."
Social Studies,"But as we will see, as we get to 264 BCE, these two great powers in the Mediterranean start to come into a little bit of conflict.."
Social Studies,"And you can see here in blue that Carthage had an extensive empire that controlled most of the the western Mediterranean. You can imagine, it was only a matter of time before they come into conflict with each other. It turns out they are actually going to have three significant wars. Some historians view it as the most significant and largest scale wars up to that point in history. The first of these happens in 264 and then it goes on for 23 years to 241 This is known as the First Punic War."
Social Studies,"You can see it on the timeline right over here going from 264 to 241, right over there. It's a result of a conflict that starts between two city-states in Sicily. Sicily is this island right over here. You have the city-state of Syracuse which is a powerful city originally established by the Greeks, and it gets into a scuffle with Messana which is another city-state at the northern, northeastern tip of Sicily."
Social Studies,"Rome and Carthage, these two great powers get embroiled and it ends up being a conflict over the island of Sicily where Carthage already had a foothold on the west coast. What's interesting going into this war is that Carthage had a powerful, you could view it as an empire over the sea. It had a very powerful navy. While Rome had a very powerful army. Not really much of a navy, to speak of. But as we'll see as we go through the First Punic War, that will change."
Social Studies,"The first major battle happens at Agrigentum, I'm probably mispronouncing it here, on Sicily. The Romans are able to win decisively, and then the Carthaginians, you could imagine, started to say, ""Well maybe we should engage them more into sea."" That happens in 260 at the Battle of Lipari Islands which are right over here. When the Romans get defeated there, they say, ""Hey, maybe we need a little bit more of a navy."" And so over the course of these several decades, you have this continual fighting."
Social Studies,"There are some Carthaginian or Punic victories we've talked about in previous video. The word Punic is derived from what the Romans called the Carthaginians which is derived from their roots as Phoenicians. You have some Punic victories, but for the most part, Rome is successful. And so, at the end of the First Punic War, a few things happened. You have Carthage leaves Sicily. Carthage expelled Sicily. You have war indemnity."
Social Studies,"Rome tells Carthage, ""Hey, you've gotta pay us ""for all of the damage you created."" This is difficult for Carthage because a war cost Carthage a lot, and Carthage, especially, it didn't have citizen soldiers. Its army was made up of ... Its navy had citizen, I guess you say, sailors. But it's army was made up mainly of mercenaries. These are soldiers who really, if you pay them enough, they're gonna fight for you. They don't really have allegiances based on some type of ideology or citizenship."
Social Studies,"Carthage, as they went through this many decades war, they went ahead and pay all these mercenaries. They had their own cost. And now, Rome is making them pay indemnity. War indemnity to Rome. The other, I guess you could say side effect of this First Punic War is that it was a catalyst for Rome building its navy. builds You can imagine especially the cost of the First Punic War, it becomes very difficult for Carthage. It actually de-stabilizes Carthage."
Social Studies,"A lot of the mercenaries, when they're not paid as they see they should be, they actually rise up. From 240 to 238, you have a Mercenary War. So 240 to 238 you have a Mercenary War. Eventually, it's able to be put down by the Carthaginians but the side effect is it weakens their hold on Sardinian Corsica. And so, by the end of the Mercenary War, the map looks like this right over here."
Social Studies,"You could view this map as what the Mediterranean looked like in 238 Where you see now the Romans not only have control of the Italian peninsula, they've gained control over Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily. Roman power is only going to increase but the Carthaginians, this proud empire, they're not done here. In 218, the Carthaginian general Hannibal, the famous Hannibal, decides to attack the Romans. He does it in a unconventional way. He attacks from the north."
Social Studies,"He takes his army, which includes elephants through the Swiss Alps. This is an artist depiction of Hannibal's army with its elephants going through the Swiss Alps. They're able to wreak havoc over the Italian peninsula. This goes on for roughly 15 years. 'til 201 you have the Second Punic War. Even though Hannibal's able to wreak havoc for over a decade on the Italian peninsula, he's never able to fully take control of Rome. There's several explanations there."
Social Studies,"One is that the people that he conquers kept rising up against him. They weren't just happy to be subjugated by the Carthaginians, by the Punics, I guess you could say. And he never was able to get as many reinforcements as necessary to fully subjugate Rome. By the end of the Second Punic War, the Romans decide to take the battle to Carthage. In 202 BCE at the Battle of Zama, the Romans are able to decisively beat Hannibal. Hannibal is called back to defend the homeland and he is defeated here at Zama."
Social Studies,"In 201 BCE, you have the end of the Second Punic War. By that point, at the end of the Second Punic War, you now have Rome in control of significant chunks of the Iberian peninsula that used to be under control of Carthage. And Carthage has really been reduced to a client state of Rome. This is roughly what the map looks like. After this, Rome isn't happy. This was a pretty ugly war. Hannibal was here wreaking havoc on the Italian peninsula. He was almost successful at taking over Rome."
Social Studies,He was an existential threat to the Roman Republic. Carthage essentially becomes a client state of Rome. They have to pay war indemnity. They really can't have a significant army anymore or a significant navy.
Social Studies,"Many people in Rome over the next several decades even though Carthage is weakened so much, they start arguing, ""Hey, we should just completely destroy this city ""because every time we destroy them or at least we beat them ""we get into this peace treaty ""but then they get powerful again and then ""we get into a war with them."" These are very ugly wars. Finally, in 149, let me write this, as Carthage is starting to reassert a little bit of power, it's trying to rebuild its military, the Romans get scared."
Social Studies,"They say, ""You know what, let's just finish them off ""once and for all."" They say, ""All right."" They start to put very onerous terms on the Carthaginians. They say, ""Hey, move your city further inland. ""We don't want you to ever be a power."" The Carthaginians of course really can't. They say, ""Hey, we're just gonna move our entire city ""and we're gonna cede to your demands."" And so the Romans used that as grounds for attack. From 149 BCE to 146 you have the Third Punic War."
Social Studies,"Which is really the one where Rome goes to destroy Carthage, and they are able to destroy Carthage ending a 700-year city-state, empire, whatever you wanna call it. The city of Carthage is utterly destroyed. Its inhabitants are enslaved which the Romans like to do for subjugated people. The city was burned in a very systematic way for 17 The Romans wanted to ensure that Carthage could never rise up again to threaten Rome."
Social Studies,"After the Third Punic War, the Romans are now the dominant empire in the Mediterranean. Not only did they control that, what they controlled going into the Third Punic War, but now they controlled Carthage's African colonies. The same year, 146 BCE, the Romans were also able to take control of Greece. As we exit out of the Third Punic War, you now have a Rome that is extremely powerful and this Roman Republic is starting to resemble this empire. It's not officially an empire yet."
Social Studies,"It's still officially a republic, but it's taking control of other people so you could view it as an empire. It's starting to take shape as this major civilization that will eventually control the entire Mediterranean.."
Social Studies,"You might remember that during the Punic Wars they were able to take over Carthage's possessions in Africa, and in Spain, at the end of the 3rd Punic War, they were also, and this wasn't part of the Punic War, but they were separately, in 146 BCE, were also able to take over Greece. So any state that has conquered these people that have different languages, cultures, and they don't have the same rights as a citizen of that state, well, this is, by most definitions, what would constitute an empire."
Social Studies,"But, during Julius Caesar's birth and during his life, Rome was still officially a republic, and that's referring more to its form of government; you had a very powerful Senate, you had these Consuls who were elected for these one-year terms, and there were all of these checks and balances. As we'll see, his life, especially the end of his life, marks the transition to an empire, in which there's a Roman Emperor who holds most of the power."
Social Studies,"But let's go into the story, and there's going to be a significant cast of characters here that I'm going to go into. So by 60 BCE, Julius Caesar is roughly 40 years old, and he's already a significant figure in the Republic. He is born to a patrician family, he rises up through the ranks, he's charismatic figure, and in 60, he forms a triumvirate with two other powerful figures in Rome, so you have..."
Social Studies,"This is Julius Caesar, of course, and he forms this triumvirate, which later gets known as the First Triumvirate, with Crassus, who is the richest man in Rome at the time and is believed to be one of the richest men in Roman history."
Social Studies,"As you can see, Crassus is a good bit older than Julius Caesar, he's born more than a decade before Julius Caesar, and he also forms this alliance with Pompey, who is also a little bit older than Julius Caesar, and is a significant military figure, a general, in the Roman Republic."
Social Studies,"And this First Triumvirate, even though it wasn't an official, it's an official government group, it allowed them to really hold the power of the Roman Republic, and to really move and hold the power within the Senate, this First Triumvirate. And even though Julius Caesar was a Patrician, he was part of the nobility, they had populist tendencies, they wanted to do things for the people."
Social Studies,"You could view them as, in certain ways, progressive, they wanted to do land redistribution, versus the conservatives, who wanted to hold the power in the aristocracy. And so, this First Triumvirate is able to use their influence to put Julius Caesar in as Consul for the year 59 BCE."
Social Studies,"And, as I just mentioned at the beginning of this video, there are two Consuls, the other one was a figure named Bibulus, but Julius Caesar is able to dominate the position, and he's a very powerful Consul, and he tries to put all of these populous reforms into place. So this is already starting to cause a lot of tension in the Senate between the populus and the conservatives."
Social Studies,"Now, after he's done his one-year term, he becomes Pro Consul, which you can view as a military governor, and he's given regions that border Gaul, so he's given what would be considered Southern France right over here, border with the Gallic tribes, I guess you'd say, near the Italian Alps; these are two of the regions, two of the three regions, that he's given to govern. And he uses his position as military governor, as Pro Consul, to expand the territories into Gaul, to take on these Gallic tribes."
Social Studies,"Now the Gauls, or these Gallic tribes, they're super fragmented, there's many, many of them, Plutarch says on the order of 300 of these Gallic tribes. They were militarily, fairly sophisticated, they were, many historians say, comparable to the Romans, but it was their fragmentation that allowed Julius Caesar to go after them."
Social Studies,"So over the course of his governorship, of his position as Pro Consul, you also have the Gallic Wars, and that's what I have depicted here in red, from 58 BCE to 52 BCE, and they end here in Alesia, where Julius Caesar's legions are able to win decisively. And that is the end, and he's able to take all of this territory for Rome."
Social Studies,"Now, while that was happening, in 53 BCE, which is right over here, in 53, yeah, this is 53 BCE, Crassus, who you might remember, was part of this First Triumvirate, he is off over here in the East fighting the Parthians; you might remember, the Parthians, this is now the Parthian-Persian Empire, they're the successors of the Seleucids or the successor of Alexander the Great, who was the successor in Persia of the Achaemenid Empire, and while fighting the Parthians, he is killed, Crassus is killed while fighting the Parthians, which breaks up this First Triumvirate, and then Pompey switches sides."
Social Studies,"He switches sides over to the conservative side. So now, instead of being one of Julius Caesar's allies, he becomes one of his opponents. And so Julius Caesar, he's victorious, he's able to conquer these powerful Gallic tribes."
Social Studies,"Plutarch, according to him, Julius Caesar's legions fought on the order of three million Gauls, I don't know if those numbers are exaggerations, they sound like they might be a little bit of one, of which one million were killed and one million were enslaved, 800 cities were destroyed, 300 tribes were overrun; and those might be exaggerations, they probably were, but it tells you the scope of what Julius Caesar did when he took over Gaul."
Social Studies,"So, he's already this very charismatic figure, he was Consul, but he's a controversial figure in the Senate. He has these more populist tendencies, while there's a lot of these conservatives in the Senate. The First Triumvirate breaks, Pompey switched sides, he's able to take over Gaul, and so you can imagine as he is now victorious, the Senators are worried."
Social Studies,"They're like, this guy, if he comes back to Rome, he might have too much power, and he might have too much power to do the things that we, especially the conservatives, don't want him to do. This land redistribution, and all of the things like that. And so they tell him, in 50 BCE, so this is 50 BCE, let me circle that, in 50 BCE they tell him to leave his Pro Consul position, disband his army, and return to Rome. Now, Julius Caesar's thinking to himself, wait, I just did all of this."
Social Studies,"These people are afraid of me, if I go without my title, without my army, who knows what they're gonna do to me when I go back to Rome. So he says, I either go back without my armies, or I go with my armies. And so, he decides to do the latter, he takes his armies, and he crosses the Rubicon River. Now, crossing the Rubicon, I'm gonna write this down, Crossing the Rubicon, is now a phrase that we have in our culture that means you've gone past the point of no return."
Social Studies,"There's a famous quote ascribed to Julius Caesar once he crossed the Rubicon, as the die has been cast, it's the point of no return. And this was a really big deal, because it was illegal for a governor general, a Pro Consul, to take their legions outside of territories they governed, and this wasn't just any region, he was taking it into the Italian peninsula, he was taking it to Rome. So this was very, very, very illegal."
Social Studies,"So the Senators weren't happy about this, so they said ""Hey Pompey, you have to go face ""your former ally, Julius Caesar."" Now Pompey doesn't know that Julius Caesar only has one legion, a legion is about 4-5000 soldiers."
Social Studies,"He's thinking surely if Julius Caesar is crossing the Rubicon, he must have a trick up his sleeve, he's already had, you know, conquering Gaul, he's established himself as this significant military figure, and so Pompey says, you know, Senators, I'm not gonna keep him from going to Rome just yet, I'm gonna go over to the East into Greece where we can build up our armies and make sure we are prepared to retake Rome."
Social Studies,"And so the Senators aren't too happy about this, but a good number of them says, ""Okay, well if you're ""gonna leave, we're gonna go with you."" And so, Julius Caesar is actually able to, in 49 BCE, take Rome. But this isn't the end, and we will continue it in the next video, because you, as I just said, the power of Rome has now moved over to Greece."
Social Studies,"A good number of the powerful Senators, you have Pompey and his armies over in Greece, Pompey controls significant fractions of the navy, and so a civil war has now broken out in the Roman Republic.."
Social Studies,"If I were just to return to Rome, they already are threatened by me, who knows what they're going to do to me? So he decides to cross the Rubicon and enter Rome. And so the Roman senators, they say, okay, let's get Pompey, the famous general, who used to be part of Caesar's triumvirate but had switched sides, to engage with Caesar."
Social Studies,"But Pompey says, you know what, I'm not so sure if Caesar is beatable right now, he wasn't aware that Caesar only had one legion, maybe there was a trick up Julius Caesar's sleeves. So Pompey takes his forces and retreats across the Adriatic to regroup, with the intent of coming back and retaking Rome. And so you can imagine, a lot of the senators, especially the powerful senators who were in opposition to Julius Caesar, go along with Pompey."
Social Studies,"So Julius Caesar, even though he's now in control of Rome, he knows that this isn't the end of it, that a civil war has begun, that it's only a matter of time before Pompey's forces and these senators return and retake Rome. So he decides to take the fight to them. He puts his second in command, Marcus Antonius, often known as Mark Antony, who was one of his generals in the Gaelic Wars, he puts him in charge of, he puts him in charge in Italy."
Social Studies,"And then Julius Caesar leads several of his legions off across the Adriatic, and it's a pretty interesting story in its own right. They cross during the winter, which was a bit of a surprise attack, because no one would've expected them to cross the winter in the Adriatic, and to break the blockade of Pompey, 'cause Pompey controlled the navy."
Social Studies,"But he's able to engage Pompey several times, and then, finally, in 48 BCE, he is able to decisively beat Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus, which is right over here in central Greece. So his enemies, his opponents, Julius Caesar's enemies are now defeated, and Pompey is in retreat. He tries to escape to Alexandria. And this is where the story gets even more interesting. So this is a little bit of background."
Social Studies,"In 51 BCE, so right about there on that timeline, and right about here on this timeline, Ptolemy XII, who was the pharaoh of Egypt, dies. Ptolemy, Ptolemy passes away. And this is a little bit of background. It was called Ptolemaic Egypt, and even this guy was called Ptolemy, because, you might remember that Alexander the Great, when he conquered Persia in the 330s BCE, he also conquered Egypt."
Social Studies,"And then, once Alexander the Great passed, once he died, one of his generals, Ptolemy, Ptolemy I, established a Ptolemaic Empire over Egypt, established Ptolemaic Egypt. And so this is Ptolemaic Egypt right over here, which was significantly less powerful than the Roman Empire, and the historical accounts say that they essentially bribed their way to maintain their independence up to this point."
Social Studies,"But Ptolemy XII, when he dies in 51 BCE, dies in 51 in his will he wants two of his children to co-rule Ptolemaic Egypt, and they were young. One of them, Ptolemy, creatively named Ptolemy XIII, was 10 years old. And his daughter, the other one that he wanted to co-rule, Cleopatra, was 18 years old, and this is a picture of Cleopatra, and this is now the Cleopatra. In popular culture, the movie Cleopatra, when people talk about Cleopatra, this is the Cleopatra they're talking about."
Social Studies,"But, you can imagine, this co-rule thing doesn't really work out that well, and civil war has broken out in Ptolemaic Egypt, with the supporters of Ptolemy XIII, you can imagine, this is only a 10-year-old, young kid, it's really the adults that are probably running the show, but the supporters of Ptolemy XIII are the ones that seem to have the upper hand at the time that Pompey is running away to Alexandria, which is the seat of power, a city established by Alexander the Great, and the seat of power in Ptolemaic Egypt."
Social Studies,"Now, the supporters of Ptolemy XIII, they say, okay, we don't wanna mess around with Julius Caesar, who seems to be quite powerful, with his legions. So why don't we do him a favor. When Pompey comes, why don't we kill him? And so, in 49, or 48 BCE, this is after, remember, Pharsalus, Pharsalus was in August of 48 BCE, you have Pompey leaving, and in 48 BCE, he is killed."
Social Studies,"So Pompey is now killed in 48 BCE by the supporters of Ptolemy XIII, thinking that this is gonna curry favor with them with Julius Caesar. Well Julius Caesar really does not like this. He likes to establish his reputation as a magnanimous ruler, someone who likes to forgive his enemies, someone who wants to unify the people of Rome. And so he's in pursuit of Pompey."
Social Studies,"When he gets to Alexandria and realizes that he was killed by Ptolemy XIII supporters, he decides to take the other side and join forces with Cleopatra. And, not only is he able to support her in a political, military sense, he helps her defeat her enemies and become, and come onto the throne, become the pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt. He also has an affair with Cleopatra."
Social Studies,"And, at the time, this is now 48 BCE, where you have, so let's see, this is 50, 49, 48 BCE, which is roughly late 48 and early 47 BCE, when Julius Caesar was actually in Alexandria, they actually have an affair. And this is a Julius Caesar who is in his early 50s, and this is a Cleopatra who is in her early 20s. And through that affair, they have, by most accounts, a child, Caesarion, later on. But this affair puts, or I guess this support for Cleopatra, puts Cleopatra on the throne."
Social Studies,"And, even though Julius Caesar does not take control of Ptolemaic Egypt, it makes Ptolemaic Egypt something of a client state, something of a client state of the Roman Empire. And then Julius Caesar returns back to Rome. He does several other things, engaging in the east here, but, eventually, he gets back to Rome. And, over several periods, he gets himself declared dictator. And dictator today has a term of someone who kind of takes power, maybe unlawfully, someone who just runs the show."
Social Studies,"Under Roman law, under the Roman Republic, there was actually a position called dictator, that could be appointed for these six-month terms, especially when they was in times of emergency, that they could do whatever they needed to do. But now he got appointed dictator multiple terms and for more than six months. And in 46, he gets elected dictator for 10 years. So now 46 BCE is, let's see, this is 45, 46 BCE, he gets elected dictator for a term of 10 years."
Social Studies,"And then in 44 BCE, he gets, he gets declared dictator for life. Now, this whole time, even though he tried to be someone somewhat conciliatory against his enemies, his enemies were kind of brooding and saying, what can we do to get back at this? And so, on March 15th, 44 BCE, and this is one of the most famous dates in history, his opponents in the senate, led by Marcus Junius Brutus, literally attack Julius Caesar in Rome, and this is an artist's depiction of that attack, and they kill him."
Social Studies,"You might have heard of the Ides of March. Ides of March, that is the date March 15th, and it's referring, when people say it today, they're referring to that event that happened on March 15th, 44 BCE, where the dictator of Rome, and he was really emperor, even though he wasn't declared emperor yet, he had absolute power over Rome, Julius Caesar was killed by his enemies, and that those enemies were led by Marcus Junius Brutus."
Social Studies,"And, as you can imagine, this then puts Rome into another phase, I guess you could say, of the civil war. Or you could say into another civil war. Now, before we leave Julius Caesar, it is worth saying some of the things he did. He did try to do some of these populist reforms. He's also well known for establishing the Julian calendar. Julian calendar."
Social Studies,"The Roman calendar before the Julian calendar got pretty off on an annual basis, but the Julian calendar got a lot closer to our current Gregorian calendar that we use today, so the days didn't shift as much as Earth orbited around the Sun. So I'll leave you there, and in the next few videos we'll talk about what happened after Julius Caesar, the civil war, I really could say the civil wars, that broke out, and how they really culminated with Rome officially going from being a republic to an empire.."
Social Studies,"Now you can imagine that all sorts of turmoil emerges from that. At the time of the assassination, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony are co-consuls. You might remember Mark Antony from the previous video, one of Julius Caesar's generals in Gaul. He was also put in charge of the Italian Peninsula when Julius Caesar went to go and take on his opponents, take on Pompey in Greece."
Social Studies,"And so Mark Antony is the remaining consul, and he says, ""Well, what do I do? ""Do I immediately try to punish these conspirators?"" In particular, you have Brutus, Brutus and Cassius, who were considered two of the leaders of the conspiracy, and he decides instead of putting the Senate into further turmoil, he tries to have a little bit of a compromise and doesn't immediately punish them. And they're able to go from Rome and then go to the East, where they are the de facto leaders of the eastern provinces."
Social Studies,"But then in 43 BCE, things get a little bit more interesting. Julius Caesar in his will, he declares that his nephew, Octavian, or will be shortly known as Octavian, who's 18 years old at the time of the death on the Ides of March, that he is, in his will, should be his adopted son, and so makes him the natural heir of Julius Caesar."
Social Studies,"Now, Antony, who's also one of Julius Caesar's right hand men throughout and is one of his strong supporters as he came to power, he also, in a lot of ways, could've claimed, ""Well, I have some rights here ""to some of the power that Julius Caesar has gotten,"" and then there was a third figure, Lepidus, and this is a picture of him right over here. This is actually a picture of the three."
Social Studies,"This is Mark Antony, this is Octavian, and this is Lepidus, and Lepidus was also a significant supporter of Julius Caesar. So the three of them get together, and this is Lepidus's timeline right over here, each of these timelines show the lifespans of these characters, so you can see when they were born and when they died. You get a sense of their ages and when they happened to pass away."
Social Studies,"And so these three characters get together, and they form a triumvirate, and this triumvirate is called the Second Triumvirate, 'cause you might've remembered the First Triumvirate between Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, and that was an informal agreement. This one actually gets legal backing, and not only do they form this triumvirate, but they're given incredibly powerful power over the Roman Republic. And they decide to go after the conspirators."
Social Studies,"So in 68, sorry, (laughs) so in 42, I don't know what my brain is doing, in 43, the triumvirate is formed, and so in 42, they eventually are able to meet the conspirators who killed Julius Caesar, and they meet them at the Battle of Philippi, which is right over, let me do this in a color you can see, the Battle of Philippi, where they're able to defeat the conspirators."
Social Studies,"So after the defeat of the conspirators, they essentially divide the republic, although it really is an empire, they divide the republic between them. Antony, Mark Antony, he becomes the ruler, the de facto ruler of the East. Mark Antony becomes the de facto ruler of the East, and then he actually is the nominal ruler over Gaul as well, but then he put someone else in charge there."
Social Studies,"And as we'll see over the course of this 17, this tumultuous 17 year period, Mark Antony really has a lot of his control and influence in the East. But they've essentially split the empire between the three of them. And right at that split, Octavian doesn't get so much of the empire, but we'll see that'll change shortly where he's able to be in control of the western half of the empire in a matter of a few years."
Social Studies,"So after that, then in 41, and this is where Cleopatra enters into the picture, and she always makes this a little bit more colorful, Mark Antony decides that he wants to meet with Cleopatra. So he's now leading the East. He starts leading it from Athens. Then he moves where he governs from to Ephesus, and he calls Cleopatra, and he already knows her, he's met her several times, to come meet him here in Tarsus."
Social Studies,"And here in Tarsus, and then they go back to Alexandria, a romance starts between Mark Antony and Cleopatra, one of the most famous romances in all of history. Remember, this is the same Cleopatra who had a romance and a child likely through Julius Caesar. And Mark Antony and Cleopatra will actually have three children together, and two of which were conceived in this time period right over here, this period around 41 BCE. So this is where we are on the timeline right over there."
Social Studies,"But then in 40 BCE, the Parthians invade. And you might remember the Parthians. This is another very significant, you really could consider them a peer empire to the Romans. On this map, you're only seeing the very left or the most westward tip of the Parthian Empire. They had control of, when you remember the Achaemenid Empire, the Seleucid Empire, of most of Persia. They are a significant empire that was really a check on ancient Rome. And so they decide to invade. They decide to invade."
Social Studies,"And the Romans already have trouble with the Parthians. You might remember Crassus, one of the first three triumvirs, members of the triumvirate. He went and, while fighting the Parthians, that's where he was killed, and so the Romans had had some interest in going after them, and now you have the Parthians who are taking it to the Romans. They've taken it on the offense."
Social Studies,"So Antony, he goes from, when he finds out about this, and he's apparently in charge of the East, so it's a bit of an embarrassment for him, he goes to Tyre, which is the remaining significant holding that the Romans have. While he's in Tyre, he finds out that his wife, he does have a wife, so this thing that he has with Cleopatra is really an affair, his wife is embroiled in a civil war with Octavian."
Social Studies,"And the civil war, and you'll see there's this general issue throughout especially the later stages of the Roman Republic and even the Roman Empire, that as Rome expands, it needs these armies, and one of the things that they promise these soldiers are, ""Hey, after you serve, when you're a veteran, ""we're gonna give you some land so you can be a nice farmer ""or at least landlord, other people might do the farming, ""and you can have slaves and all the rest."" Now, in order to keep doing that, you keep needing new land."
Social Studies,"So Octavian, in order to make some of these veterans happy, was giving away land, some of which was already, I guess you could say owned, by existing Romans. So Mark Antony's wife was using that really as an excuse to try to vie for power. And just to be clear, even though there was this triumvirate between Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus, things were tense from the beginning between Antony and Octavian. Both of them, both of them saw themselves as natural heirs to Julius Caesar."
Social Studies,"Antony says, ""Hey, this young little 18 year old upstart, ""what has he done to deserve this empire? ""I've been beside Julius Caesar the entire time."" Octavian is here saying, ""Hey, I am now officially ""Julius Caesar's adopted son."" He takes on the name Caesar."
Social Studies,"""I am the rightful heir to Julius Caesar's power."" And so sitting here in Tyre, Antony decides, ""Okay, let me go take on Octavian."" So he decides to go and lay siege to Brundisium in order to defend his wife, even though he obviously didn't care too much about his wife's honor. And it's over there, they're essentially at loggerheads. He tries to go into the civil war. His wife, Antony's wife, dies. Octavian and Antony decide, ""Okay, okay."
Social Studies,"""Maybe we should not be fighting each other so much."" And so they decide once again to be friends, and then they really at that point decide to split the empire more formally between East and West, where, in the triumvirate, you have Mark Antony still getting the East. You have Octavian being in control of the West, including the Italian Peninsula, and then Lepidus gets Africa. And you have Lepidus getting Africa right over here. So I'll leave you with that."
Social Studies,"There's a little moment of, it looks like a little bit of peace, between Mark Antony and Octavian. But as we'll see in the next video, it's about to get a lot worse. The big picture from here is that they were able to take care of the conspirators, but now they're starting to squabble. The triumvirate is starting to squabble, especially Mark Antony and Octavian. Lepidus was always kind of the, I guess you could say, the third wheel here. It was always between Antony and Octavian."
Social Studies,"Cleopatra has a romantic relationship with Antony. She's aligned with Antony. At the same time, and remember, Cleopatra, she's considered the richest woman in the world at this time. She is the pharaoh of Egypt. And remember, Egypt, even though the people were Egyptian, Cleopatra is part of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. She is Greek, but what makes her interesting is that she takes on a lot of the trappings and she learns to speak Egyptian."
Social Studies,"So she's quite popular from, I guess, relatively speaking terms, with the Egyptian people. And the other thing to keep in mind is we have these Parthians. These Parthians have just laid another insult on the Romans right over here when they invaded Syria and are able to take over this territory. And this is especially annoying to Mark Antony, who is supposed to be in charge of the East.."
Social Studies,"with the Parthian invasion of Syria in the eastern provinces of the Roman Republic, and it really is an empire, the Roman Republic or the Roman Empire. But Marc Antony, who was in control of the east of the empire, he wasn't able to deal with it immediately because he goes to Brundisium in order to take his wife's side on a civil war between her and Octavian."
Social Studies,"Now, his wife dies and he makes good with Octavian, in fact, so good with Octavian, he marries OCtavian's sister, Octavia, and they decide, alright, let's continue to be friends here and they divide the Roman Empire, the Roman Republic, whatever you wanna call it, between them, where Marc Antony keeps control of the east, you now have Octavian with control over the west and they gave Lepidus, who's always a bit of the third wheel here, they gave him some of the southern provinces right over there."
Social Studies,"Now it seems like all is good, but as we've already talked about, the tension between Antony and Octavian is there, it was there from the beginning and in this video, we're going to see that it gets a lot, a lot worse. So Marc Antony goes back to the east, where he starts planning his invasion of Parthia, not only does he wanna take back the territory that they took in 40 B.C.E., but he actually wants to avenge them for Crassus' death in 53 B.C.E."
Social Studies,"Julius Caesar had been planning an invasion of Persia, and you have to remember, after Alexander the Great, all of these western rulers, especially the Romans, they all had their sights on Persia, they said, ""Hey, maybe I can be just like Alexander the Great ""and take over the Persians."" So Marc Antony is planning his invasion of Persia but he doesn't get the troops that he wants from Octavian and so that starts to build the tensions even further but he goes to his lover, Cleopatra, who is the richest woman in the world, the pharaoh of Egypt, and says, ""Hey can you give me some Egyptian troops?"" And so he plans an invasion of Parthian Persia with a combined Roman and Egyptian troops."
Social Studies,"Now unfortunately, that is a failed invasion. As they try to make their way in, they get pretty far, but they weren't able to protect their supply lines carefully and so the Parthians are able to attack them, attack their supply lines and while they do, the king of Armenia just kinda doesn't really do anything about it and so Marc Antony is forced to retreat and so you can imagine, he's not too happy about this. The Parthians in 40 B.C.E."
Social Studies,"were able to take all of this territory, in 36 B.C.E., so now we are right over here, in 36 B.C.E., we have a failed revenge invasion of the Parthians, he's betrayed by the Armenian king. Now the other thing that's happening is that Lepidus is now out of the triumvirate."
Social Studies,"He tries to do a little bit of a land grab after him and Octavian go after another governor in Sicily, but when they're successful, when Lepidus tries to take control of Sicily, Octavian says, ""No no no no, ""not only can you not do that, ""but you're now out of the triumvirate."" So 36 B.C.E. is a situation where Octavian continues to try to consolidate his power in the west, Lepidus is now out, and Marc Antony faces another, I guess you could say embarrassment against the Parthians."
Social Studies,"So then we get to 33 B.C.E. So let's see, this is 33 B.C.E. right over here on this map and finally, he's able to muster up enough of a force to take not revenge on the Parthians, but to take some of the territory, but in particular, to take revenge on the Armenian king."
Social Studies,"And so Marc Antony, it's his first win after awhile, tries to make a lot of this, and so when he goes, he goes back to Alexandria, where of course his lover Cleopatra reigns, and there, he has this big celebration to say, ""Hey look, I went and was able ""to take out the king of Armenia."" Now this celebration, it rubs the Romans in a wrong way on a whole bunch of dimensions."
Social Studies,"One, they never really like Cleopatra, they view her as a foreign queen, they didn't like her when she was Julius Caesar's lover, they definitely don't like her when she's Marc Antony's lover, and they're kind of peeved that he decides to go Alexandria and do this ceremonial victory party that typically only happened in Rome, it looks like this guy doesn't really even view himself as Roman anymore. He likes to go back to Alexandria."
Social Studies,"And the real salt that he rubbed, especially in Octavian's wounds, was a speech he gave which will later be known as the Donations of Alexandria. So what he starts doing is putting his children, especially the children that he has with Cleopatra, as the rulers of a lot of the eastern provinces."
Social Studies,"But the worst thing that he does, is in that speech, in the Donations of Alexandria, this is in 33 B.C.E., right over here, he declares that Cleopatra's son that was apparently the son of Julius Caesar, Caesarion, that he is the rightful heir to Julius Caesar."
Social Studies,"Now, Octavian does not like this, he says, ""Hey, I'm the adopted son, I'm the rightful heir, ""I don't like this Caesarion guy."" And so for the next few years, in 33 and 32 B.C.E., so we're in this period on that timeline, we're in this period on this timeline, tensions start to get a lot, lot, lot worse between Octavian and Marc Antony, they are publicly accusing each other of not even being legitimate people with legitimate authority, they are really starting to question each other, they're really starting to go at each other."
Social Studies,"And it all culminates in 31 B.C.E., it all culminates in 31 B.C.E., so this is where we are right over here, with the naval battle at Actium."
Social Studies,"And for the most part, and Marc Antony and Cleopatra are both there, and they're on their heels, they're surrounded by the forces of Octavian, and the best that they can hope for is just an escape and Antony and Cleopatra are able to escape and it's very clear from that battle that they really only cared about saving their own hides and their own wealth, and they left the most of their navy, they returned with only 60 boats to Alexandria but they leave most of their navy to kind of have to deal with the forces of Octavian."
Social Studies,"So they were already on their heels, they have this escape in 31 B.C.E., many historians will call the Battle of Actium, and this is a depiction of the naval battle at Actium right over here, as the end, after this, there was no chance, really, for Cleopatra and Marc Antony in any way, to rival Octavian, that Octavian was now the real sole power in what is evolving from a Roman Republic to a Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"But Antony and Cleopatra, maybe they didn't realize it as much, they go back to Alexandria and continue to plot, seeing how they can get back at Octavian. So Octavian doesn't want much of this, so he decides to go attack them in Alexandria in 30 B.C.E."
Social Studies,"And Antony tries to make a last stand against Octavian but his soldiers really aren't in the mood to fight so he goes back to the palace, he looks for Cleopatra, Cleopatra gets one of her servants to tell Marc Antony, 'cause she has no mood to see him, because who knows, he's raving mad, he might wanna kill her or kill him, who knows what he might wanna do, Cleopatra had her servant tell Marc Antony that Cleopatra was dead and so Marc Antony, he's already down, his soldiers have deserted him, there's no way for him to take on Octavian, he's essentially lost, and now Cleopatra, his lover, is apparently dead."
Social Studies,"He stabs himself repeatedly in the stomach. Now, Cleopatra finds out about this and then she has Marc Antony brought to him, he doesn't die immediately, stabbing yourself in the stomach is a way of having a very slow and painful death. And he dies essentially in her arms."
Social Studies,"And then Cleopatra is taken, then, by the forces of Octavian, but then she too decides that she wants to commit suicide or at least that's what most accounts say and the most common account is that she gets a snake smuggled into her rooms, a poisonous snake that she taunts and gets to bite her, which allows her to die, so both Cleopatra and Marc Antony die in 30 B.C.E., and Octavian now, really the main power, he kills Caesarion, who was Cleopatra's son with Julius Caesar, as the only possible rival, and so here we are on 30 B.C.E., Octavian is victorious and then he goes back to Rome and continues to consolidate his power."
Social Studies,"Until we get to 27 B.C.E., which is often marked as the beginning of the Roman Empire, when Octavian was given the name Augustus, which means illustrious one, and from then on, he will continue to reign with more and more and more power that he continues to consolidate for many, many, many, many more decades.."
Social Studies,"Eventually it becomes a battle between Augustus, or at the time, Octavian, versus Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Octavian is able to be victorious. And, on 27 BCE, he is declared, or this is the date that historians often use as the beginning of him officially being emperor. This period from 27 BCE, with Augustus being emperor, all the way to 180 CE, so this roughly 200-year period, this is a relatively good time for the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"As we will see, there is still a lot of conflict, there is still a lot of bloodshed, but it is a relatively stable period. It is also referred to as Pax Romana, or the Roman Peace. What we see pictured here, these are most of the Emperors of that roughly 200-year period. Augustus proves to be a relatively good administrator. He lays a good foundation for the next several hundred years of the Empire. The Roman Empire officially being ruled by an Emperor."
Social Studies,"It's eventually going to meet its demise, the Western Empire, at least, in 476 CE, so, it's gonna go for roughly 500 years, and Augustus lays a strong foundation for it. He's viewed as a strong administrator. He really builds a lot of institutions. From a historical perspective, it's worth noting that Jesus was born under Augustus's rule. Most historical views are Jesus was born in some place between 4 BCE and 6 BCE. Now, Augustus was followed by Tiberius."
Social Studies,"Tiberius, here, was both Augustus's step-son, and he married Augustus's daughter, so he was a step-son, and son-in-law. He also proved to be a relatively capable emperor. You can see Augustus had a fairly long rule. He took power in his 30s, and his power ended in his 70s. Tiberius, too, had a fairly long rule. From a historical point of view, or even a Biblical point of view, it's worth noting that Jesus would have been crucified under Tiberius's rule."
Social Studies,"The Roman Emperor referred to in the New Testament is Tiberius. It would have been his governor, Pontius Pilate, who orders the crucifixion of Jesus. Now, after Tiberius, you have his great-nephews, or his great, great-nephew, and you can see they're all not directly related, but they're all kind of family. His great, great-nephew is Caligula."
Social Studies,"Caligula, that's his nickname, is a bit of an infamous figure, one of the infamous figures, in history amongst the Roman Emperors 'cause he's really viewed as a sadist, as a pervert. He's known for killing people just for fun, and he is quickly assassinated. His term only, or his power, only lasted for several years. Then, in his place is put his uncle, Claudius. After Claudius comes another infamous figure of history, and that is Nero. Nero, he's known for, Rome had a significant fire in 64 AD."
Social Studies,"Many of the Roman citizens believed that Nero did it intentionally to clear out space for a palace. Significant number of Romans died in that fire. He killed a ton of people, including his mother. He's maybe most famous for persecuting Christians. There's some accounts that he would dip them in oil and set them on fire in his garden just as a source of light."
Social Studies,"These people, to say that they were insane, or demented, or sick, normally I try to avoid making any judgement on some of these historical figures, but both Caligula, and Nero, if we believe the accounts that we get from that period, and shortly after that period, were not, by any stretch of the imagination, good people. Nero eventually does commit suicide, and, with Nero's end, you actually have the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Let me write that down, Julio, Julio, Claudian, Claudian dynasty."
Social Studies,"The reason why it's called the Julio-Claudian dynasty is that all of these characters, let me circle them, or underline 'em. All of these characters right over here are essentially from the same family. They're descended from both the Julian line, Julius Caesar, and the Claudian family. That's why it's called the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Now, at the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, you have a new dynasty, Vespasian. There's a short civil war, so the Pax Romana is not without some war and bloodshed."
Social Studies,"In fact, this whole time, there's a lot of relatives being killed, people who might threaten the Emperor being killed, and that's just talking about the Romans, themselves. They're constantly fighting the Germanic tribes, and groups in the Middle East, and taking more, and more, and more territory, and these are extremely bloody thing. They're constantly enslaving people."
Social Studies,"The Roman Empire sometimes it looks like this neat, clean, idealistic thing, but there was a lot of enslaving of people, destroying of towns. Killing people out of paranoia, or really just out of the joy of killing, if you take the case of Caligula, or Nero. Then, you have the Flavian dynasty. I don't have the three Flavian Emperors depicted right over here. You have Vespasian, you have Titus, and you have Domitian. Of note, the Colosseum. The famous Colosseum in Rome was built during their time."
Social Studies,"They're also known for the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem. Then, after that, you have what historians, and especially Niccolo Machiavelli, so this is many centuries later, called the Good Emperors. The Good Emperors are these characters, let me square them off right over here. And these are really the last five emperors of the Pax Romana."
Social Studies,"We should even use the term, Good, maybe in quotation marks, because for Rome's enemies, for the slaves of Rome, for the people who were thrown into the Colosseum just because they were a prisoner of war, or they committed some simple crime, the Roman Empire didn't seem good. The reason why they were viewed good is they were viewed as able administrators. They continued to expand the Roman Empire. Trajan in particular, the peak of the Roman Empire comes, in terms of Geography, comes under Trajan's rule."
Social Studies,"That's this map right over here. This is the largest geographic extent that the Roman Empire takes on. Trajan is succeeded by Hadrian, most known for Hadrian's Wall. He had the upper-bound of the Roman Empire. Then, the Pax Romana ends with Marcus Aurelius, who is viewed as a, he's actually wrote meditations. He's a philosopher-emperor. He's viewed as one of the last great stoic philosophers. With that, you have the end of this period of Pax Romana."
Social Studies,"As we'll see in the next few videos, we then start really getting into the decline of at least the Western Roman Empire, as we'll see the Eastern Roman Empire outlives the West by a good thousand years.."
Social Studies,"If you're one of the tribes that are still fighting with the Roman legions, if you're one of the roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of the population that is a slave, you might not view this as such a good time. But things only get worse after the death of Marcus Aurelius, who's viewed as the last of the five good emperors, so to speak. His son, Commodus, takes over, and Commodus is the beginning of a succession of emperors who are less and less competent."
Social Studies,"The Empire becomes more and more corrupt, less and less stable, and things really come to a head and start to decelerate even further, or I guess accelerate downward even further, in 235 CE when the emperor Severus Alexander is assassinated, and this throws the empire into a 50-year crisis called the Third Century Crisis because it happened in the third century. And over this 50 years, there's 26 claimants to emperor. The empire is temporarily split into three different states."
Social Studies,"There's attacks from the east from the Sassanids, the Sassanian Empire, they're the successors to the Parthians. You have attacks across the Rhine and the Danube from Germanic tribes. All of that makes this a very unstable period for Rome. Now the Third Century Crisis is considered to end in 284 with the ascension of Diocletian, and Diocletian is viewed as a somewhat, or a reasonably strong emperor."
Social Studies,"He's known as the last emperor that really persecuted the Christians because they didn't follow the Roman religion, they did not worship the emperor as a god, but he's also, or maybe he's most famous for splitting the empire. He decides that probably one of the main causes of the Third Century Crisis is that the empire has gotten too vast. It has too many borders. It's hard for one emperor to administer the whole thing, so he splits it into East and West from an administrative point of view."
Social Studies,"They don't become separate empires, but he decides that he is going to rule from the East and that he will have a co-emperor who rules from the West. And not only does he set that up, but he sets up what's called a tetrarchy."
Social Studies,"Beyond himself and his co-emperor, they each have a second-in-command that if any one of them were to die or would have to retire somehow, that that second-in-command could take over, and once again, this is to address some of the issues of the Third Century Crisis where the wars for succession, and this isn't just during the Third Century Crisis. We've seen it in multiple videos."
Social Studies,"Rome is famous, even during the Pax Romana, for these really ugly succession battles, but as we'll see, the splitting of the empire into East and West, even though it started as an administrative thing, over time it's going to become a real split and they're going to turn into two different empires. Now after Diocletian, you have another significant emperor. You have Constantine, and Constantine is known for many things."
Social Studies,"Maybe most famously, he embraced Christianity, as opposed to Diocletian who persecuted Christians, you have the Council of Nicaea and the Nicaean Code where there's now a uniform church doctrine around Christianity. He has the Edict of Milan, which makes Christianity legal under Roman rule. Maybe most famously on his deathbed, he gets baptized. He becomes the first Christian emperor."
Social Studies,"He also moves the capital to, officially moves the capital of the entire empire, to what at the time was Byzantium, but then he renames it to Constantinople, named after him. Now it was still one unified empire, even Diocletian who co-ruled with a co-emperor, he had veto power over the emperor to the West. Now as we get further into the fourth century here, and especially into the fifth century, we'll see that the empire further and further fragments, and gets diluted, and really just breaks down."
Social Studies,"One major factor in that breakdown is in that fourth century, in the fourth and fifth centuries, you have a group called the Huns coming in from Central Asia, coming in from Northern Europe right over here, and they are fierce, nomadic conquerors, and they're so fierce that they start pushing more of the Germanic tribes across the Rhine and the Danube, and a lot of these Germanic tribes, at first, even though their history has been fighting the Romans, a lot of them try to seek refuge in the Roman Empire and they're given refuge in the Roman Empire, but while they have that refuge, they're treated very, very, very badly, and all of that comes to a head in the, well I guess you could say, the last quarter of the fourth century with the Gothic Wars, and the Gothic Wars really have a decisive battle at Adrianople, originally Adrianopolis, named after the Emperor Hadrian."
Social Studies,"And at Adrianopolis, at Adrianople, the Gothic tribes in particular, and when we say Gothic, we're really talking about Germanic tribes, and this one in particular, as you can see from this legend right over here, this is the Visigoths, or Western Goths, they're able to decisively defeat the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens. He's actually killed at Adrianople, and then the Visigoths just continue to hang out here in the Roman Empire. They continue to move forward."
Social Studies,"In 410, they're able to actually sack Rome and they eventually settle in the Iberian Peninsula and in Southern Gaul. Now after the Battle of Adrianople, you have another significant emperor, Theodosius, because what you'll see is that Diocletian persecuted Christians, Constantine now embraces Christianity, he becomes a Christian, he says Christianity is legal. Theodosius now, right as we are about to enter into the fifth century, he makes Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"So in roughly 100 years, the Roman Empire went from persecuting Christians to making it the official religion and actually going the other way, starting to persecute some of the pre-Christian religions or rituals. The other thing that happens as we enter into the fifth century now, as we go into the fifth century, you have the capital of the Western Empire is moved from Rome to Ravenna."
Social Studies,"With the idea, the emperor see all of these Germanic tribes, they feel threatened by them, that Ravenna is easier to defend. It's surrounded by kind of marshy, swampy area. The other thing of note about Theodosius, and as we move into really the last century of the Western Roman Empire, is Theodosius was the last Roman Emperor to rule all of Rome. After that, the East and West are going to be ruled essentially independently. They're essentially going to be separate empires."
Social Studies,"Then as we get into the fifth century, we already talked about the Visigoths sacking Rome, then in 455, you have the Vandals which is another Germanic tribe that was similarly originally pushed out by the Huns. You see them in blue right over here. They make it down the Iberian Peninsula to North Africa. They eventually get to Carthage, and they become a little bit of a naval power and they eventually are able to, in 455, sack Rome as well. So Rome is really taking a hit multiple times."
Social Studies,"And then finally, the end of the Roman Empire, or the Western Roman Empire that most historians consider the end of the Roman Empire, is when the Germanic ruler General Odoacer, or Odoacker depending on how you pronounce it, is able to oust the emperor in Ravenna, and so then you have the official, and just to be clear, this is, let me write Roman Empire, and so Odoacer is able to essentially end the Western Empire as we know it."
Social Studies,"And after that, the Western Empire becomes more and more fragmented into these kingdoms that are ruled by essentially Germanic kings, and then we are now entering into the Middle Ages. Now the big question that historians have a lot of fun thinking about is why did all of this happen? Why did the Roman Empire fall? And before we even talk about why it fell, we should give them a little bit of credit."
Social Studies,"Even in this video where I talk about the fall of the Roman Empire, I'm covering 300 years of history, and if you start with the founding of the republic until Odoacer takes over Ravenna, ousts the emperor, we're talking 1,000 years. Most civilizations, most empires don't last anywhere near that long. So to some degree, it's surprising that it lasted so long. But in terms of the causes of its decline, we've talked about several of them in this video. The empire got divided."
Social Studies,"The East and West stopped viewing themselves so much as the same empire. Trade sometimes broke down. They didn't support each other militarily. The Eastern Empire was generally stronger, so it allowed invading tribes to focus on the weak point in the West. Some historians would say that the Roman Empire stopped expanding, and it needed that expansion in order to keep getting more land and more slaves that really drove its economy."
Social Studies,"One major factor probably was the Huns that caused this great migration in the fourth and fifth centuries, it caused the Germanic tribes to cross the Rhine and cross the Danube and become either settled as part of the Roman Empire or threatened the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"Another theory, and all of these are probably contributors, is that as the Germanic tribes settled, they actually became more and more part of the Roman military, and some of them were officially part of the military, some of them were mercenaries, soldiers for fortune, paid soldiers, and so you can imagine their allegiance to Rome was not as strong. Some folks say Christianity may have been a factor."
Social Studies,"That the empire might have lasted, especially when people were doing what their traditional rites, rituals, they worshiped an emperor, but now Christianity wasn't about worshiping an emperor anymore. A lot of people think it's corruption, instability, and we've talked a little bit about that. It could've been invasions, not just from the Germanic tribes and the Huns, but also the Sassanids on the East."
Social Studies,"So I'll leave you there, and to think about, what was the cause or maybe what allowed the Roman Empire to survive for so long?."
Social Studies,"Augustus was the first emperor of Rome. - [Dr. Zucker] And the person who established the Pax Romana, that is the Roman Peace. The event that prompted the building of this altar to peace under Augustus was Augustus's triumphal return from military campaigns in what is now Spain and France. - [Dr. Harris] And when he returned, the Senate vowed to create an alter commemorating the peace that he established in the empire."
Social Studies,"We're talking about the Ara Pacis but, of course, this has been reconstructed from many, many fragments that were discovered, some in the 17th century, mostly in the 20th century. - [Dr. Zucker] Actually, it's a small miracle that we've been able to reconstruct this at all. It had been lost to memory. - [Dr. Harris] The remains of it lay under someone's palace. When it was recognized, what these fragments were, it became really important to excavate them and to reconstruct the alter. - [Dr."
Social Studies,"Zucker] That was finally done under Mussolini, the fascist leader, in the years leading up to the second World War and during the second World War, and that was important to Mussolini because Mussolini identified himself with Augustus, the first emperor of Rome. Mussolini was very much trying to reestablish a kind of Italian empire. We should talk a little bit about what an altar is. - [Dr."
Social Studies,"Harris] We talk about the alter, really what we're looking at are the walls of the precinct around what is in the middle of the altar, where sacrifices would have occurred. - [Dr. Zucker] The altar itself is interesting and important when we think about Augustus. Augustus is establishing a centralized power. Since its earliest founding years, when it was under the rule of kings, Rome had been controlled by the Senate. - [Dr. Harris] The Senate was basically a group of the leading older citizens of Rome."
Social Studies,"So Rome was a republic and it really was a republic until Julius Caesar, who was the dictator and Augustus's uncle, and then Caesar is assassinated, there's civil war, and then peace is established by Augustus. - [Dr. Zucker] Right. Augustus, whose real name was Octavian, is given the term Augustus as a way of representing his power, and it's interesting, the kind of politics that Augustus involved himself with."
Social Studies,"He gave great power back to the Senate, but by doing so, he established real and central authority for himself. - [Dr. Harris] He made himself Princeps, or first among equals, but of course he controlled everything. - [Dr. Zucker] He also held the title of the head priest of the state religion, and so he held tremendous power. - [Dr. Harris] His uncle, Julius Caesar, had been made a God, and so he also represented himself as the son of a God. - [Dr."
Social Studies,"Zucker] And so the idea of establishing this altar has a political as well as spiritual significance. - [Dr. Harris] He's looking back to the Golden Age of Greece of the fifth century BC, but he's also looking back to the Roman Republic. He's reestablishing some of the ancient rituals of traditional Roman religion. He's embracing traditional Roman values. - [Dr. Zucker] But even as he's doing that, he's remaking Rome radically."
Social Studies,"He's changing Rome from a city of brick to a city of marble and the Ara Pacis is a spectacular example of that. - [Dr. Harris] And when we look closely at the Ara Pacis, what we're going to see is that this speaks to the sense of a golden age that Augustus brought about in the Roman Empire. - [Dr. Zucker] One of the most remarkable elements of the Ara Pacis is all of the highly decorative relief carving in the lower frieze. - [Dr. Harris] And that goes all the way around."
Social Studies,"It shows more than 50 different species of plants. They're very natural in that we can identify these species, but they're also highly abstracted and they form these beautiful symmetrical and linear patterns. - [Dr. Zucker] There is a real order that's given to the complexity of nature here."
Social Studies,"This massive, elegant acanthus leaf, which is a native plant, which were made famous in Corinthian capitals, and then almost like a candelabra growing up from it, we see these tendrils of all kinds of plants that spiral. - [Dr. Harris] And there are also animal forms within these leaves and plants. We find frogs, and lizards, and birds. - [Dr."
Social Studies,"Zucker] And the carving is quite deep, so that there's this sharp contrast between the brilliance of the external marble and then the shadows that are cast as it seems to lift off the surface. - [Dr. Harris] Art historians interpret all of this as a symbol of fertility, of the abundance of the Golden Age that Augustus brought about. - [Dr."
Social Studies,"Zucker] We also see that same pattern repeated in the pilasters that frame these panels and then we also have meander that moves horizontally around the entire exterior, and it's above that meander that we see the narrative friezes. We have to be a little careful when we try to characterize what precisely is being represented. There are lots of conflicting interpretations. - [Dr. Harris] These panels relate, again, to this Golden Age that Augustus establishes."
Social Studies,"These refer back to Aeneas Rome's founder and Augustus's ancestor. We see other allegorical figures representing Rome and peace. - [Dr. Zucker] We're now looking at a panel that's actually in quite good condition, but that doesn't mean we really know what's going on. - [Dr. Harris] No, there's a lot of argument about what the figure in the center represents. Some art historians think this figure represents Venus. Some think it represents the figure of peace. Some the figure of Tellus or Mother Earth."
Social Studies,"In any case, she's clearly a figure that suggests fertility and abundance. - [Dr. Zucker] She's beautifully rendered. Look at the way the drapery clings to her torso, so closely, as to really reveal the flesh underneath like the goddesses on the Parthenon, on the Acropolis in Greece. - [Dr. Harris] And on her lap sit two children, one of whom offers her some fruit. There's fruit on her lap."
Social Studies,"On either side of her sit two mythological figures who art historians think represent the winds of the Earth and the sea. - [Dr. Zucker] Look at the way the drapes that they're holding whip up, creating these beautiful almost halos around their bodies. - [Dr. Harris] And at her feet, we see an ox and sheep, so there's a sense of harmony, of peace, and fertility. - [Dr. Zucker] And that must have been such a rare thing in the ancient world. - [Dr."
Social Studies,"Harris] Augustus reins after decades of civil war after the assassination of Julius Caesar, so I think there's a powerful sense that this was the Golden Age. These allegorical or mythological scenes appear on the front and back of the altar, and then on the sides of the altar we see a procession. - [Dr. Zucker] The frieze moves from the back wall of the precinct, up towards the very front on both sides, and the figures are also facing towards the main staircase. - [Dr."
Social Studies,"Harris] Art historians are not really clear what event is being depicted here. - [Dr. Zucker] Art historians aren't clear about any of this, are we? (laughs) - [Dr. Harris] No, there are a couple of possibilities that have been raised. One is that what we're seeing is the procession that would've taken place at the time that the altar was inaugurated."
Social Studies,"The figures that we see here are priests and we can identify those figures because of the veils on their heads, and there also seem to be members of our Augustus's family, although their identities are not quite firmly established. - [Dr. Zucker] We think we know which figure is Augustus. Although the marble itself is not in especially good condition and we've lost the front of his body, and we also think we can identify one of his most important ministers. - [Dr. Harris] And that would be Agrippa."
Social Studies,"If we think about this as looking back to the frieze on the Parthenon from the Golden Age of Greece, those figures are all ideally beautiful. They don't represent anyone specific, so much as the Athenian people generally. - [Dr. Zucker] But these are portraits. - [Dr. Harris] That's right, and we can't always identify them for certain, but they really are specific individuals taking part in a specific event. - [Dr."
Social Studies,"Zucker] Throughout the republic, portraiture in stone was something that the Romans were extremely good at and so it doesn't surprise me that they would not look to the idealized so much as look to the specific. - [Dr. Harris] We also noticed those differences in the depths of the carving. Some figures are represented in higher relief. Other figures that are supposed to be in the background are represented in low relief. So there's a real illusion of space and of a crowd here at the procession. - [Dr."
Social Studies,"Zucker] Another way that the specificity of the Romans is expressed, is through the inclusion of children. This is a sacred event and a formal event, and yet there are children doing what children do, that is to say, they're not always paying attention. - [Dr. Harris] Augustus was actually worried about the birth rate and passed laws that encouraged marriage and the birth of children. The Ara Pacis originally was painted."
Social Studies,"We would have seen pinks, and blues, and greens, and it's very to imagine that when we look at the marble today. - [Dr. Zucker] Especially in Meier's building, which is so stark and modern. It's almost a little garish to imagine how brightly painted this would have been. - [Dr. Harris] So, one of the things that Augustus said of himself was that he found Rome a city of brick and he left at a city of marble."
Social Studies,Augustus created an imperial city and here we are 2000 years later in the Rome that Augustus created. (light piano music).
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] This is Rome in the year 320 C.E. You see this big plaza, that's the so-called Circus Flaminius, beyond which is a theater, the Theatre of Marcellus, and to the left is the Capitoline Hill. - [Steven] And now we're approaching a large stadium, a place for sporting events. - [Bernie] This is the Circus Maximus used for the chariot races among other things, it also was used for parades, for example The Triumphal Parade. It could seat up to, we think, 250,000 people. It was quite a big complex."
Social Studies,"- [Steven] And there's an island in the middle, around which the chariots would race. You can see right in the middle of that, the large obelisk. - [Bernie] This is one of the first two very tall obelisks brought from Egypt to Rome by the first Emperor Augustus. It symbolized to the Egyptians, and the Romans knew this, a sunbeam, and the Romans thought this was appropriate for the Circus because the Circus itself had a temple of the sun god."
Social Studies,- [Steven] And this temple to the sun is placed directly across from the imperial box and just to the left of the stadium is the palace. - [Bernie] The Great Imperial Palace. At the end of the Circus Maximus is a triumphal arch. We know that was dedicated to the Emperor Titus and celebrated his victory over the province of Judea.
Social Studies,"The reason that there's a triumphal arch of Titus here is that the parade known as the triumphal procession went through the Circus Maximus and all along the triumphal procession there were temples, triumphal arches and other monuments. - [Steven] And aligned with the Arch of Titus, we can see in the distance one of the great Bath complexes of ancient Rome. - [Bernie] That's the Baths of Caracalla."
Social Studies,"Now we're looking at the Caelian Hill, you can see the Claudian Aqueduct in the valley between the Caelian hill and to our left the Palatine Hill, you see a plume of smoke going up from the imperial bath complex on the Palatine hill. To our right we're passing by a great complex, a garden in the middle of which is a temple, and that's the temple of the Divine Claudius. Claudius was made a god after his death and Nero incorporated this piece of land into the Golden House, which covered 120 acres."
Social Studies,"- [Steven] What I find so fascinating is that so much of the ancient architecture that I associate with Rome in the Colosseum District is really a reaction against Nero, as a reaction against his excesses. - [Bernie] Everywhere you look, the selfishly expropriated public land under Nero is given back to the public, and the public was very happy. These are all public facilities, so think of the Colosseum, beyond that where you have some smoke coming out, those are baths, the Baths of Trajan."
Social Studies,"It's open to the public. In front of that is the smaller bath complex, the Baths of Titus. - [Steven] We're now flying just over the Arch of Constantine which is another landmark that survives into the modern era. - [Bernie] Yeah so another triumphal arch. In front of that you see that cone, that's the Meta Sudans, the Great Fountain, and to the right is the Flavian Amphitheater, also known as the Colosseum. But you can see why it was called the Colosseum in the Middle ages, not in antiquity."
Social Studies,"Because of that enormous 100 foot tall bronze statue, which is a statue of the sun god. Now that was originally a statue of Nero. After his death, the Vespasian had the head taken off and had it converted to a statue of the sun god. We see just beyond the second arch of Titus in the city. - [Steven] And just to the right of that the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine. - [Bernie] Yes. - [Steven] And these are all structures that remain."
Social Studies,"And now we're just veering off to the left, and at the top of the hill is the palace, we're seeing it from the other side. - [Bernie] Yeah this is the palace at the top of the Palatine. Because the emperors lived up there, the word palace became synonymous with where a leader would live. We're turning now away from the palace and looking over toward the Roman Forum. - [Steven] In the ancient era the Forum was a place for oratory, it was a place for government. - [Bernie] In the republic, yes."
Social Studies,"It was a place for meetings of the Assembly, as well as the Senate. The Senate had its own building, but the people would assemble in front of the speaker's roster or platform to listen to their leaders explain policy, propose laws, and debate each other when they were running for public office. - [Steven] We seem to be flying through the smoke of the Temple of Vesta."
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] The Temple of Vesta, famous for its eternal flame, and beyond that is the triple arch of Augustus, it celebrates the restoration by the Parthians in modern day Iran of military standards. Interestingly, if we're looking now at a rostra, a speaker's platform right ahead of us, that's a late antique rostra, dating to the end of the third century AD. - [Steven] But we can see the original just a little further on."
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] Yes, bookending the Forum Plaza at the other end is another rostra, the Augustan Rostra originally built by Julius Caesar. - [Steven] And in between the rostra, there's this beautiful equestrian sculpture. - [Bernie] This was actually the early third century AD emperor Septimius Sevverus, and we know about the statue being there both archaeologically from the remains of the base, but also from coins that illustrate it. - [Steven] We're surrounded by public buildings and by temples."
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] We can see over the right the Temple of Castor and Pollux. Straight ahead is the Temple of the Divine Julius Caesar. If you look closely, you can see the colt statue inside. We know about that from a coin that illustrates it. Caesar was shown as an augur, a priest. Up in the pediment of the temple you see a star. It illustrates the comet that was seen in the sky over Rome in the summer after Caesar's assassination. - [Steven] We're surrounded by columns, and these were honorary columns."
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] Yes, in front of the law court known as the Basilica Julia. And we know from Pliny that to portray a human on top of a column was in effect, to make him a god, or make him god-like. What we see now in front of us is one of the two Trajanic reliefs, that interestingly enough, in their backgrounds illustrates the Roman Forum as it appeared in the time of the emperors Trajan and Hadrian. A lot of people are surprised to see to see that set up here on the Forum Plaza."
Social Studies,"That's actually where they were found at the end of the 19th century. - [Steven] But now they're in the Senate. - [Bernie] They were moved there in the 20th century to protect them from the elements. - [Steven] When you go into the Senate to see them, you don't see these blues, you don't see those yellows, you don't see these greens. Almost all Roman sculpture was painted."
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] This is one of the great breakthroughs of the last 10 years or so, development of a number of noninvasive techniques to detect color, even little traces of pigment left on the surface of white marble. Now we're seeing the so-called Statue of Phocas. It's called the Statue of Phocas because it was excavated at the beginning if the 19th century and they found an inscription to the Byzantine emperor Phocas."
Social Studies,But we think that Phocas' inscription was added on top of an older inscription to the Tetrarch Diocletian. And he is therefore the figure shown on top of the column. - [Steven] We're now looking up the hill that leads to the capital line. - [Bernie] Masking the hill is the Tabularium or the state record office in the background. In front of it are three temples.
Social Studies,"To the left the Temple of Saturn, in the center the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, worshiped as gods after their deaths, and to the right, the Temple of Concordia that celebrated the harmony between the social classes of Rome, and then during the Empire it symbolizes the harmony between the Imperial family and the Roman Senate. We're passing over the Augustan rostra now, and just to the right is the Arch Septimius Severus. He left a very big mark in the Forum."
Social Studies,"- [Steven] And his arch even today overshadows so much of the Forum. - [Bernie] Yes, it's very well preserved. - [Steven] Let's move now to the Imperial Fora. As opposed to the Roman Forum, these are fora that individual emperors built to honor their own rule. - [Bernie] Fora is the plural of forum, so the Roman Forum and the Imperial Fora. Starting from the time of Julius Caesar, it was recognized that the old Roman Forum was too crowded."
Social Studies,"If you were an emperor and you wanted to honor your favorite god, or eventually after you died have a temple to yourself, you needed to build a new public space. Where better to do that than adjacent to the old Roman Forum? So Julius Caesar's Forum which we're now over, uses the backside of the Senate as a part and parcel of this new Forum Julium, the Forum of Julius Caesar, which is dominated at the end of its main axis by the Temple of Venus Genetrix, his favorite goddess."
Social Studies,"The other emperors followed suit, so across the way is the Forum of Augustus, dominated by the temple of his favorite god, the god Mars, the war god. - [Steven] The temple is actually flanked by two hemicycles. - [Bernie] Yes, and in those hemicycles were niches with some of Rome's leading historic figures, and also the Julian ancestors of Augustus going all the way back to Aeneas. - [Steven] You can see other imperial fora that are squeezed in, especially the Transitorium."
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] Yeah the Transitorium is also called the Forum of Nerva. It's basically just a monumentalization of the argulatum the street that runs next to the Senate house into the Roman Forum and then going into the other direction to the east into the subura, the slummy part of Rome filled with tenements where lots of people lived. - [Steven] But if the Transitorium is squeezed in, you would never say that about the Forum of Trajan."
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] No, the last one of these imperial fora is the Forum of Trajan it's the biggest by far, it's fairly well preserved at the end of it is a Temple of the Divine Trajan which was built after Trajan died but he actually started building this while he was still alive so in front of the temple is the Column of Trajan that celebrates his two victories over the Dajians, the people in modern day Romania. In flanking the column are two libraries."
Social Studies,"In front of the libraries in the column is a bigger building the Basilica Ulpia which probably served as a law court and had some other functions. It was a big multipurpose space. - [Steven] Just coming into view is one of the most famous extant Roman monuments, the Pantheon. - [Bernie] Now we're flying to the northern Campus Martius which was filled with funiary monuments, temples, ustrinai, places where emperor's bodies were cremated. The columns like the column of Marcus Orelius."
Social Studies,"- [Steven] And the first Roman emperor built his own mausoleum, the Mausoleum of Augustus. - [Bernie] We can see this round structure in the northern most part of the Campus Martius. - [Steven] Now we've just swung around so we have a great view of the Pantheon."
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] We can really see the Pantheon we have this hypothetical arch that a lot of people think was in front of the Pantheon and to its left was the most prestigious shopping center of Rome the Saepta Julia and next to that is this great Egyptian Temple of the Goddess Isis, you can see two obelisks. - [Steven] So what we're seeing is a city that is filled with monuments to Roman rulers. Monuments that celebrate their achievements, their military victory, the wealth that they brought to the city."
Social Studies,"- [Bernie] Yes, but now as we turn and go back to the south and southern part of the Campus Martius we see that these emperors were not only selfish but they created a lot of public facilities and built up their popularity that way so we've just been flying through the entertainment part of the city of Rome. - [Steven] When you walk through Rome now, this city that is so layered with history it's sometimes difficult to reconstruct in your mind how these ancient monuments fit together."
Social Studies,This recreation provides such rich detail it allows us to see the city literally as if we had traveled back to the fourth century. - [Bernie] The idea is to take all of the monographs and studies of the individual monuments and weave them together into something that gives us a synthetic view of the whole city. In the past we've been able to study just the Pantheon or just the Roman Forum again it could take decades of your life.
Social Studies,Now thanks to this new 3D technology within a very short amount of time even just a day I would really say the average person can know more about the ancient city than even a PhD in the field of Roman Archeology did five or 10 short years ago. (piano music).
Social Studies,"And what's interesting about this writing on these oracle bones that over 3000 years old is that modern Chinese script is actually evolved from this over 3000 year old writing. Also in that Shang dynasty, we see major bronze artifacts. And, once again, it's the first real historical evidence we see of a reasonably large geographic area being unified around the Yellow and the Yangtze River. Now, in that video on the Shang dynasty, we talk about how it eventually falls in 1046 BCE."
Social Studies,"And it falls to the Zhou dynasty. And the Zhou dynasty, they defeat the last Shang emperor, Di Xin at the Battle of Muye in 1046. And based on their view of things, or current historical accounts, Di Xin became a corrupt ruler. He was under the influence of his consort and the Zhous say, hey the reason why we were able to defeat them and overthrow them and establish a new dynasty is because of the Mandate of Heaven."
Social Studies,"The Mandate of Heaven is this idea that will be incorporated by the Zhou dynasty and then becomes part of Chinese culture and tradition for thousands of years after that. Heaven, in this sense, is not a place in the clouds that some might imagine in a Western tradition. It's really, you could view it as a guiding force of the universe."
Social Studies,"And it's this idea that if leaders become incapable, if they become correct, that this guidance force of the universe will throw them out and put more capable leaders in power. And so, King Wu of Zhou who defeats Di Xin at the Battle of Muye, he invokes this Mandate of Heaven and will continue to be invoked throughout the Zhou dynasty. Now, the Zhou dynasty is going to be a very long-lasting dynasty, but it is not centralized. It can be described as kind of a feudal system."
Social Studies,"There's multiple kingdoms who have allegiance to the Zhous and at multiple times they have difference degrees of autonomy and of power. Now, the Zhou dynasty is generally divided into the Western Zhou in the capitals in the West and the Eastern Zhou dynasty when the capital moves to the East."
Social Studies,"Now, the Eastern Zhou dynasty, this period right over here between 770 BCE and 476 BCE, often known as the Spring and Autumn periods, this is often referred to as a significant period of philosophical, a philosophical golden age in China. It was the time of Confucius. It was the time of Lao-Tzu, who comes up with the Tao or the core of the Tao philosophy. So, a lot of major philosophical upbringings of even modern China start to emerge in this time."
Social Studies,"Now, the latter half of the Eastern Zhou period, you have the Warring States period. And that's where you see these dotted lines. And the Zhou dynasty, which was already very decentralized, becomes even more fragmented. And China really doesn't get well unified again until 221 BCE. In 221 BCE, you have the emergence of the Qin dynasty. And even though the Qin dynasty is very short lived, it only lasts a few decades, it's significant in that it's the first really strong central dynasty."
Social Studies,"It's often referred to as the first imperial dynasty. As we mentioned about the Zhous, very decentralized, this feudal system. But the Qin dynasty, under Qin Shihuangdi or sometimes Qin Shihuang, he is a very strong ruler. He sets up this legalistic government, very strict legal codes. He really oppressed his opponents in significant ways, but the byproduct of that is he was able to really unify China."
Social Studies,"Now, other things that he did, the Great Wall of China, which didn't just get built by him, but there were already walls that were being erected throughout China at this time. He started to unify these walls and then break down the walls that were within his empire. And so, he's often credited as really starting the formation of what we now call the Great Wall of China, which kept being built and improved upon by later generations, later dynasties."
Social Studies,"The other thing that he's well-known for is establishing this centralized bureaucracy where the civil servants are able to earn their spots based on taking exams. This would last for several thousand years in China. Now, as I mentioned, the Qin dynasty would be short-lived, but then it would be followed by one of the most significant dynasties in Chinese history that really takes the work of the Qin, but makes it a little bit more moderate."
Social Studies,"And the Han dynasty is often referred to, by Chinese historians, as the Golden Age of China. It's a time where Confucian philosophy really becomes dominant. You have significant advances in math, science, and technology. This is an image of the nine chapters on the mathematical art, where ideas like Gaussian elimination and Cramer's Rule, things that wouldn't be explored in Europe for over a thousand years, are documented during Han China. You have the famous paper making emerge during Han China."
Social Studies,"And as you can see, it lasts for over 400 years. There's a brief period right over here where you have the Xin dynasty gets established, and that separates the Western Han from the Eastern Han, but this is a significant period of development of Chinese philosophy, Chinese writing, Chinese technology that lasts even until today."
Social Studies,"And to get an appreciation of the Confucian philosophy, remember Confucian lived over several hundred years before the Han dynasty, but this is when it really becomes the philosophy, or even you could think of the religion of China. I'll leave you with a few quotes from Confucius. And I'll do a whole video on him later on, but these are some of my favorite. ""Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance."" And this is a version of the Golden Rule."
Social Studies,"""Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire."" And to put into context, these ideas of Confucius, the writing, the mathematics that was developed there, it was the civil service. These continue on for several thousand years. And this was during the time, you know, just to think about what else was going on in the world. This was at the time of the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"And so, it is interesting that at the time of the Qin and then Han dynasties where you first have this real centralized empire, that was right around the time that Rome itself was also becoming centralized. And it's interesting to think about, what was it about that period of history where you have these two significant empires starting to really emerge? And they weren't completely isolated. There was actually interaction between the two.."
Social Studies,"So you can imagine Kong Fuzicius, Confucius. Now what's interesting about Confucius is he grew up in a time when China was getting more and more divided. In other videos we talked about the Zhou dynasty, which begins at the very end of the second millennium. But in the time of Confucius we're in what's known as the end of the Spring and Autumn period. Confucius lived from 551 to 479 BCE. And we're ending the Spring and Autumn period and we're getting into the period of the Warring States."
Social Studies,So even in the time of Confucius there was more and more tension between states.
Social Studies,"People felt less confident in the central government, and as we'll see, in this late Spring and Autumn period, and especially as we get into this really violent period known as the Warring States period, a lot of philosophers started to arise and philosophies began to arise because people were struggling with these questions of, what is the role of the state? What does it mean to be a good person? How does humanity fit in with the cosmic order? Now, what's interesting about Confucius is by his own account he says that he doesn't come up with anything new."
Social Studies,"It's more of him trying to resuscitate or rejuvenate some of the traditions of the past. Most historians would give him more credit. Even though Confucius does look to the early Zhou dynasty for a lot of his inspiration, and he looked to a lot of the traditions of the ancestors, he definitely puts a spin on it which makes it a very powerful philosophy and arguably religion as we get into this Warring States period, and especially as we get into a more unified China under the Qin and Han dynasties."
Social Studies,"And as we'll see under the Han dynasty in particular, Confucianism becomes essentially the state religion. Now to get a sense of what Confucius preached, and his life, he spent most of his life both teaching and preaching. A lot of people compare him to Socrates even though he predates Socrates. And simultaneously he was also building a career as a civil servant, but his legacy is definitely around his preachings, and most of his life was here in the state of Lu in eastern China."
Social Studies,"So there's three general themes that you could talk about Confucius's teachings. I encourage you to go look at his Analects, they're quite interesting, to get many many more of them. But a lot of it is around respecting traditions and respecting elders. Here's a quote from the Analects. ""A young man should serve his parents at home ""and be respectful to elders outside his home. ""He should be earnest and truthful, loving all, ""but becoming intimate with his innate good-heartedness."
Social Studies,"""After doing this, if he has energy to spare, ""he can study literature and the arts."" And there's a lot of talk of, if someone is to be a good citizen they need to be a good child first. They need to be a good son. Now he also talks about, what does it mean to be a just ruler? ""If you control people by punishment, ""they will avoid crime, but have no personal sense of shame."
Social Studies,"""If you govern them by means of virtue and control them ""with propriety, they will gain their own sense of shame, ""and thus correct themselves."" And as we'll see, morality and ethics plays a huge role at a personal level and also at a state level to Confucius, and we'll talk about other philosophies where that might not be as strong of a sense. Now another very big theme to Confucius was looking to yourself. Through self-improvement you can be a better citizen, a better child, a better ruler."
Social Studies,"""Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance. ""Learning without thought is labor lost; ""thought without learning is perilous. ""When you see someone of worth, ""think of how you may emulate. ""When you see someone unworthy, examine your own character."" I like that one in particular. ""Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire."" So a very close statement to the Golden Rule."
Social Studies,"Now as I mentioned, Confucius and Confucianism was not alone in this period of the Spring and Autumn period and especially as you get into the Warring States period. During that time we have what's known as the Hundred Schools of Thought, which, this time period starts around the time of Confucius and goes until Qin dynasty ends the Warring States period, and in a very strong way unifies China."
Social Studies,"Now we already talked about Confucianism, which talks a lot about ethics, but its goal, remember Confucius himself was a civil servant. He was an administrator. He thought a lot about, what does it mean to be a just ruler? So it definitely touches on the practical to a good bit. Now, many people say it's an ethical system, but many would also consider it a religion because it does touch on the metaphysical, the notions of heaven, and it borrows a lot from China's past."
Social Studies,"Now, other samples of the Hundred Schools of Thought, especially ones that have had a significant role on China's history, and even modern China, include the Legalists. The Legalists have a strong pragmatism. They are dismissive of the Confucian notion of strong internal ethics and that will guide people and rulers. Legalists are much more about, look, we need a strong, orderly central state."
Social Studies,"We need to do whatever it takes, and it might be clamping down on people hard, in order to have stability, in order to have rule. And you can imagine the context in which this Legalism is coming about. This is during the Warring States period, this incredibly violent period where the states in China are fragmented, and so you can imagine these people who are very realistic. They're like, ""Look, we've had this Confucianism. ""We have these other philosophies."
Social Studies,"""But we need strong, super centralized rulers."" And it ends up being that Legalist philosophy that wins the day as you have the emergence of the Qin dynasty in 221, and the Qin dynasty is what modern China is named after and it's considered the first dynasty to really unify China in a very strong way and create its administrative and bureaucratic systems, and it really is based on Legalism and it was able to put an end to this Warring States period by putting so much power, central power, in strong rulers who were willing to be quite violent in repressing other people in order to bring that stability."
Social Studies,"And it's notable that the emergence of the Qin is also considered the end of the Hundred Schools of Thought, 'cause the Qin as part of that order started persecuting many of the other forms of philosophy, including many of those that followed Confucius. Now other forms of philosophy, and this is just a sample, that have strongly influenced China. You have Taoism."
Social Studies,"Taoism is, according to Taoist belief, comes from Laozi, and the historical record of Laozi isn't as clear as we have for Confucius, but it's believed that he lived around the same time. Some people view him as more of a legendary figure. But Taoism is much more concerned with the spiritual than Confucianism. You see quotes, the Tao is really The Way. It's all about harmony with the universe. ""Free from desire, you realize the mystery. ""Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations."" The Tao Te Ching."
Social Studies,"Now later on, Buddhism. It's interesting, Buddha lives at around the same time, once again, his birth and date are under a little bit more in contention, as Confucius, and he lives in northeast India, Nepal area, and Buddhism really comes about in Indian, but it eventually makes its way into China, especially as we get into the first millennium CE."
Social Studies,"And in modern day China a lot of the culture and the philosophy and the religion is a combination in particular of Confucianism most strongly, but also Taoism and Buddhism. But there were other philosophies. For example Mohism is a quite interesting one. I encourage you to look at it. But it's all about this notion of impartial love. It actually has a lot of similarities, parallels, with the teachings of Jesus as told by the gospels."
Social Studies,"But that notion was viewed somewhat impractical by many of the followers of Confucius and especially the Legalists, and Mohism really didn't last much beyond the Qin dynasty. But one way to think about it is, Legalism allowed the Qin dynasty to really end the Warring States period and centralize China."
Social Studies,"But then that short-lived dynasty as a transition to the Han, the Han took over the administrative structure and the stability of the Qin to a large degree, but then they made Confucianism really the state philosophy and you could even say the state religion. And to appreciate the importance of Confucianism to Chinese culture, I'll leave you with this last quote by the historian Huston Smith."
Social Studies,"""For though Confucius did not author Chinese culture,"" as we talked about, even Confucius says, ""I didn't invent anything,"" ""he was its supreme editor.""."
Social Studies,"But there isn't a lot of historical evidence for them. And so, many historians view it more along the lines of legend, but there are many people who view these as historic facts and have attempted to place them on a historic timeline. What I'm gonna do in this video is I'm going to attempt to fit onto this historic timeline where some of the people who believe it did happen, when they believed it happened."
Social Studies,"Keep in mind that there's not a lot of strong archeological evidence, historical record here, and these accounts were written several hundred years after when they were purported to occur. So let's start in the beginning. Let's start in the Book of Genesis, in the Torah, in the Hebrew Bible, and the Old Testament. I'm not gonna go into detail on the Book of Genesis. It starts, of course, with the monotheistic God creating the heavens and Earth."
Social Studies,"And then we have the stories of Adam and Eve, and then, several generations later, the story of the Great Flood of Noah. And then Noah's son, Shem, and I talk about Shem because this is where the word Semitic comes from. You might have heard people refer to Jewish people as Semitic; but also, Arab people are referred to as Semitic; because, according to Biblical accounts, they are both viewed as descendants of Abraham, who is a descendant of Shem. So they are viewed as Semitic."
Social Studies,"The first real significant patriarch of the Hebrew Bible is considered Abraham, who I just mentioned. It has Abraham moving from the City of Ur. There's debate on which Ur that is. It might be the ancient Sumerian city in lower Mesopotamia. Or, some people believe that it was an Ur in upper Mesopotamia. But regardless of which account you take... Once again, Abraham is considered by many historians as a legendary figure. So there's not clear evidence that he existed in a historical sense."
Social Studies,"But if you take the accounts in the Old Testament and the Hebrew Bible, he would have gone with his family from Ur, and eventually migrated to Canaan, which is in, near, or around modern-day Israel, Lebanon, Palestine, that general area. So it's either from this Ur or that Ur. And Abraham is considered the first of the three significant patriarchs for the Jewish people; the other two are Isaac and Jacob. Once again, I could do a whole series of videos on the stories of Abraham."
Social Studies,"But Abraham's first son is Ishmael, who he has with the servant of his wife Sarah after they determine that they're not able to, or they don't think that they're able to, have children. According to Biblical accounts, Ishmael is viewed as the progenitor, as the patriarch of the Arab people. But later in life, Abraham, and at this point he is roughly 100 years old, and his wife Sarah, according to Biblical accounts, is in her 90s, they have Isaac, who is considered a significant patriarch in Judaism."
Social Studies,"This is a painting by Rembrandt of the famous Abraham being willing to sacrifice his son, Isaac, but then he gets stopped at the last minute. But it's viewed as a sign of his willingness to his faith in God and his willingness to follow God. Isaac's son is Jacob, and Jacob is later named by God as Israel. And so, this is where the word, Israelites, come from, and even the modern state of Israel. Now, one of Jacob's son is Joseph. Once again, this is according to Biblical accounts."
Social Studies,"There isn't a lot of historical evidence here. But it's a fascinating story, the story of Joseph, how he is sold by his brothers into slavery, and taken from Canaan to Egypt. But Joseph, once again, fascinating story, is eventually able to rise through the ranks, become the vizier of Egypt, and later, his family, including Jacob, come to Egypt when there is a famine in Canaan. And that is the explanation for the Biblical settlement of a significant fraction of the Israelites in Egypt."
Social Studies,"But then they are enslaved. According to Biblical accounts, they are enslaved for 400 years, over 400 years, and that's what you see in this green line right over here. They stay enslaved in Egypt until we get to Moses, who's considered the most significant of the prophets in the Jewish tradition, and one of the very most significant prophets amongst Christians and Muslims. So let's get to Moses."
Social Studies,"Moses' story, once again, one of these famous stories, how the pharaoh is feeling threatened by the growing population of the Jewish people, who, remember, are enslaved. And so, as the story goes, he orders all newborn Hebrew Jewish boys to be killed, but Moses' mother hides Moses, and he puts him on a basket in the Nile, and the pharaoh's daughter discovers him, and raises Moses. And so, he's able to get an education and is part of the royal court of the pharaoh."
Social Studies,"But later in life, he sees a slavemaster that's abusing a Jewish person to death, and then he kills the slavemaster. And so, he's afraid for his life, and so he runs away, fearing the penalty for killing the slavemaster, and he goes to Mount Sinai, or Mount Horeb, and this is where we think the Biblical mount, this is where the current Mount Sinai, Mount Horeb, is, and that's where we think the Biblical one might have been. That's where we have the story of the burning bush, where he is commanded by God."
Social Studies,"The angel of the Lord is speaking through this bush, and telling Moses: ""Go back, and you need ""to free the Jewish people from enslavement."" And so, he does go back, and he is able to liberate them. Once again, this is a very famous story. The pharaoh's armies follow him. He parts the Red Sea. The pharaoh's army is eventually destroyed. He takes the Jewish people back to Mount Sinai, Mount Horeb."
Social Studies,"These are sometimes viewed as two different mountains, sometimes the same mountains, different sides of the same mountains. We are not exactly sure. But most people view them as the same mountain. It was at Mount Sinai, Mount Horeb, where now Moses is able to receive the famous Ten Commandments, and he's able to receive the Jewish laws."
Social Studies,"The first five books of the Hebrew Bible, the Torah, the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, the authorship of these is ascribed to Moses. Once again, historians really debate that, but this is according to Biblical accounts."
Social Studies,"Now, once he receives this word of God, he then takes the Jewish people, they set up a tabernacle, they go through the desert for 40 years, and he brings them to the promised land, and before entering, Moses dies. But he, essentially, is able to resettle the Jewish people back in Canaan.."
Social Studies,"The next four books of the Hebrew Bible which are often given authorship to Moses. These really talk about Moses freeing the Jewish people from enslavement, getting the Commandments, the Law, from God, and eventually bringing the people so that they can resettle back in Canaan."
Social Studies,"As I mentioned in the last video, these first five books of the Hebrew Bible, also the first five books of the Christian Old Testament, they are referred to as the Torah, and they are given authorship to Moses although historians are doubtful of that. Even the historicity to the degree to which these are historical characters are significantly debated. We have the Jewish people, according to Biblical accounts, now in Canaan."
Social Studies,"As we go into the rest of this video, we're getting into more of a historical period with the first significant kings of the Israelites. Now we're getting into the first millennium BCE. The people, the Israelites, are settled in Canaan. In the 11th century, BCE you have King Saul comes to power. He's considered to be the first significant king, or the first king really of a united kingdom of Israel and Judah. This is King Saul. He is then succeeded by King David who is his son-in-law."
Social Studies,"It was a very continuous succession. David is considered a significant figure in Judaism and Christianity and Islam. He's considered a warrior, poet, philosopher. He really strengthens and really unifies the kingdom. He's succeeded by his son, King Solomon. King Solomon is famous in Biblical accounts for his wisdom. He's also known for creating the First Temple in Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"As we will see, this First Temple in Jerusalem, the way that I have marked it off on this timeline, the green is periods according to Biblical accounts, then later according to historical accounts as well. When the Jewish people were for the most part not in Canaan where they were in captivity, or they were being enslaved. They were in exile some place else. The white that I show here, this is the enslavement in Egypt, this is going to be the Babylonian captivity that we're going to talk about shortly."
Social Studies,"Then the white, this is when we have the existence of the temples in Jerusalem. The First Temple in Jerusalem, this is a depiction of it, was built by Solomon. Now the unified kingdoms Judah and Israel don't last beyond these three kings. Shortly thereafter, it gets fragmented into two kingdoms. The kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel. The kingdom of Israel is going to be overrun by the Neo-Assyrians in 722 when they refuse to pay tribute to the Neo-Assyrian king."
Social Studies,"The kingdom of Judah essentially becomes a client-state of the Assyrians. It's important to keep in mind even though these are called kingdoms for most of this history, they are client-states to larger powers whether it's the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Seleucid. They keep being client-states. They also have some degree of autonomy which is why they are called kingdoms."
Social Studies,"In 722, you have the kingdom of Israel being overrun and many of the Jewish people having to go into exile and being held captive by the Neo-Assyrians. Then as we get into the 6th century BCE, you have the famous Babylonian Conquest, The Neo-Babylonian Conquest of Nebuchadnezzar the Second, who conquers Judah. Once again, this is really a side battle between the Neo-Babylonians and the Egyptians, and we talk about that in other videos. That takes us to the Babylonian captivates."
Social Studies,"This is a picture here of Jerusalem, and maybe as equally important, that First Temple of Solomon being destroyed and the Jewish people being taken into captivity where they are taken from Jerusalem to Babylon. They're held in captivity, a significant fraction of them are held in captivity, in Babylon from this period from around 597, 586 BCE until Babylon is conquered by Cyrus the Great, conquered by the Achaemenid Persians that we talk about in another video."
Social Studies,"Once again, the end of the captivity is really a side effect of larger battles and conquests going on. But Cyrus the Great frees the Jewish people in 538 BCE. This is the end of the Babylonian captivity. He resettles them back in Jerusalem, and he and his successors assist in the rebuilding of the temple. Then you have the Second Temple of Jerusalem. You often will hear Second Temple Judaism because this is the period now where the Jewish people are resettled in Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"They are rebuilding that Second Temple that a lot of the Old Testament takes its modern form. Now this is going to last for several hundred years. As I mentioned the kingdom of Judea is a client-state of all of these various empires. It eventually becomes a client-state of the Roman Empire as we get into the end of the first millennium BCE. As we get to 70 CE, so this is shortly after the time of Jesus, you have the first Jewish-Roman War sometimes referred to as the Jewish Revolt."
Social Studies,"In that, the Romans destroy the Second Temple. This is really significant, the Second Temple as we mentioned it starts getting rebuilt at the end of the captivity and famously gets really, nicely constructed as we get into the First Century BCE. Then in 70 CE, Jerusalem is destroyed again. This time by the Romans. This is the beginning of the Jewish Diaspora where they are exiled for, now we're talking thousands of years, from Rome."
Social Studies,"They spread through the Roman Empire and other empires, and we talk more about that in other videos. This is a significant thing because now the Jewish people are for the most part dispersed. They don't have a temple, and you don't see a significant resettlement of the Jewish people into this area until we get to the 20th century.."
Social Studies,"And the central figure in Christianity is Jesus Christ. And the term Christ is given to him. It is Greek for savior, for messiah. Because his early followers view him as the prophesized messiah, savior, for the Jewish people. And his followers today view him as the savior, the messiah, for all humankind. So, you have over two billion Christians who view him central to their faith. Who view him as their god."
Social Studies,"But, above and beyond that, you also have over a billion Muslims who view him as a significant prophet. Now, just to get some context on the life and times of Jesus, most of the accounts we have of him come from the first four books of the New Testament of the Bible called the Gospel of Matthew, Gospel of Mark, Gospel of Luke, Gospel of John. Sometimes it's the Gospel According to Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John. And the term gospel today often refers to the idea of the life and teaching of Jesus Christ."
Social Studies,"So, you could view it as the life and teaching of Jesus Christ according to Matthew, according to Mark, according to Luke, according to John. But it really comes from old English for good news. And there is a related term, evangel. You might have heard of evangelical or evangelize. Also referring to good news. Now, the reason why it was considered good news is his message.... We're gonna have some examples of it in a few minutes."
Social Studies,"Really talks about this idea that the poor have the kingdom of heaven waiting for them. That there's this forgiving God that you can have a close connection with. And for a lot of people... Remember, this was in the time of the Roman Empire. Most people were downtrodden. There was slavery. People who were poor. And this idea that even the poor could go to the kingdom of heaven and, in some ways, have better access to it than the rich and the powerful was good news to a lot of people."
Social Studies,"Now, it's worth noting that these gospels were written several decades after, depending on what you view, the death and/or ascension of Jesus Christ according to Christian belief. As you can see, Jesus was born slightly before the year one. Most historians put his birth at around four to six BCE, Before the Common Era. And they put his death around 30 to 33 CE, in the Common Era. You could also use the original terms, Before Christ and Anno Dominei, In the Year of Our Lord."
Social Studies,"Our modern calendar system really uses the original view of the birth of Jesus as where we start Anno Dominei versus Before Christ or the Common Era versus Before the Common Era. Now, it's interesting that it turns out that Jesus was likely born slightly before. Slightly before the original view on the birth of Christ. Now, his birth would have been right around the time... Or it would have been under the reign of Emperor Augustus, as we talk about in other videos."
Social Studies,"And his death would have been under the reign of Emperor Tiberius. And these Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John. These are written during really hard times for the Jewish people and for the early Christians. You have the Jewish Rebellion where the Second Temple is destroyed by Rome. You have the significant Christian persecution, especially by folks like Emperor Nero where he blames the fire in Rome on Christians and he just, essentially, just kills them for fun."
Social Studies,"Really just to purge them, to persecute them. And, just to understand where all of this takes place, the life and times of Jesus takes place, it is in the Roman Empire. We're on the eastern edge of it at the eastern Mediterranean right over here. This would be modern day Israel and Palestine for the most part. This is a zoomed in version. And Jesus is born in Bethlehem. And this is a scene. I'm gonna show you a lot of paintings. As you can imagine, he's a figure that has inspired a lot of paintings."
Social Studies,"This is a figure of the three magi visiting and giving their gifts to the infant Jesus. Magi, famously the Zoroastrian priests, coming from Persia to visit Jesus, according to biblical accounts. And he is raised in Nazareth. And that's why he's oftentimes referred to as Jesus of Nazareth. And the gospels don't talk a lot about his early life. They start to talk a lot about his life once he hits his late 20's or early 30's. And the first really significant account after his famous birth to the virgin Mary."
Social Studies,"His purported father, Joseph, was Mary's husband, but the Holy Ghost or God was the actual father, making this a virgin birth. But, after that, the first significant event is really his baptism by John the Baptist. John the Baptist was another preacher, prophetic figure of that time. A significant one. He had a lot of followers. And he as baptizing people in the Jordan River, right in that region. This is the Jordan River right over here."
Social Studies,"And this is a depiction of the famous baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist. And, famously, John the Baptist said, ""No, you should be baptizing me."" But then after Jesus said, ""No, no, you baptize me."" And, after, Jesus was baptized. Famously the sun shines on Jesus and God speaks that ""This is my son."" According to, once again, biblical accounts. And John the Baptist, shortly after that, gets arrested by King Herod of Galilee."
Social Studies,"Remember, Galilee is the home region of Jesus where he will eventually do most of his preaching. And, after that, Jesus starts to really go full into effect in his ministry. And, while he's doing that, he's performing all of these miracles. He's healing people, turning water into wine, walking on water, bringing people back from the dead. And this is, of course, according to biblical accounts. You can decide if you believe these or not. And he does most of that in Galilee."
Social Studies,"And, eventually, he makes his way down to Jerusalem to meet his fate. He tells, according to the Gospels, his followers, his disciples.... And there's 12 in particular that are called out, but he has many, many more than that. That ""Look, I am going to meet my fate there, but I'm doing it willingly."" But, more than his miracles, it's interesting to look at some of what he preached. And this might give you a little bit of a sense why many people would have called this good news."
Social Studies,"So, this is from the Gospel of Matthew that I'm gonna quote right over here. And this first part comes from his Sermon of the Mount. He goes to the top of a mountain and he gives this sermon."
Social Studies,"""Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" ""Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."" ""Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy."" ""Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."" ""Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God."" So, all of that, if you're a peasant, if you're someone with not a lot, you're downtrodden, hard life."
Social Studies,"You're like, ""Look, blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" you could view this as good news. ""Ye have heard that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but I say unto you, resist not him that is evil. But whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."" Even in modern times, this is not an easy way... This is not an easy way to live. Someone who's doing something to you, don't try to seek revenge."
Social Studies,"And this is a very different tone than a lot of what you might get in the Old Testament. ""Ye have heard that it was said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, but I say unto you love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you."" Once again, not an easy thing to do. Even in modern terms, you can view this as a very forward, very advanced way of thinking about the world."
Social Studies,"He also, beyond this idea of embracing even your enemies and not seeking revenge and that the poor have access to this kingdom of heaven, he really also liked to take it to the hypocrites, especially those who viewed themselves as the bearers of the religion. In particular, he picks on the Pharisees, which was a sect of Jews at the time who viewed themselves very ritualistic. Remember, Jesus, himself, is a Jewish preacher. He's a Jewish teacher. He is viewed as a rabbi himself."
Social Studies,"""And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the street that they may be seen of men."" So, these hypocrites, they pray just so other people can see how religious they are. ""Verily, I say unto you, they have received their reward."" They've already gotten the credit from people for praying."
Social Studies,"""But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber and, having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father, who seeth in secret shall recompense thee."" So, don't make a big deal about your prayer. Do it in private and then have this personal connection with God."
Social Studies,"Now, it's worth noting that, even though he preached a lot about the kingdom of heaven for the poor, prayer is a private thing, that you shouldn't try to seek revenge, you should be very conciliatory to your enemies, he did take a strong stance on what he was preaching. He did say, ""Look, you gotta be with me if you want to enter into this kingdom of heaven."" He took some strong stances. This isn't gonna be an easy thing and this is gonna cause a lot of tension."
Social Studies,"This is one quote that you could view that way. Once again, from the Gospel of Matthew, ""Think not that I came to send peace on earth. I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I came to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother."" I would interpret this as saying this is gonna cause a lot of divisiveness. ""And the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household."
Social Studies,"He that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."" So, he takes a pretty strong stance. ""Look, you really need to follow me. But, if you follow me, there's some very good things that are waiting for you."" But, eventually, he does make his way..."
Social Studies,"He tells his... There's other.... These miracles he's performing. This is the famous Transfiguration of Christ where he makes it apparent to his followers. He kind of becomes luminescent and he becomes apparent to his followers, his disciples, that he truly is the son of God. And then, he makes his way... This is the year, depending on whether you think it's 30, 31, 32, 33 CE. He makes his way to Jerusalem to meet his fate. He's already prophesized to his followers that this is gonna be a tough fate."
Social Studies,"That he's gonna die there. And this is a very important week in Christianity. It's referred to as Passion Week. And the term passion has a different connotation. It really means the suffering of Christ. This is the week that he suffers. This is the week that he gets crucified and then resurrected. So, he goes to Jerusalem on Sunday. This is around the time of Passover. Very important religious period for the Jewish people. And he comes to Jerusalem near Passover."
Social Studies,"That Sunday that he comes is now celebrated as Palm Sunday. This is imagery of it where he's coming and some people are greeting him to Jerusalem as kind of a king. They're laying down these palms before his path. Then, this is the famous where he goes to the main temple at Jerusalem and he cleanses it of the moneychangers. He's like, ""Hey, by doing these money transactions here, you are defiling the temple."" Then, on Thursday of that week, he has the famous Last Supper."
Social Studies,"Some people believe this is the Passover seder. Most historians don't think it is. But he's meeting with his 12 disciples. And he's saying, ""One of you's going to betray me."" And it's Judas Iscariot who does. And he goes to the religious court and he says, ""Hey, I have this guy who you guys don't like."" Remember, this whole time that Jesus is doing his ministry, he's sticking it... In a lot of ways, he's calling out these Pharisees and these religious officials as hypocrites."
Social Studies,"He's getting all of these followers. A lot of these traditionalists are saying, ""This guy's blaspheming. He's saying he's the son of God. He's saying all of these things. He's doing these miracles on the Sabbath, when you're not supposed to be doing anything."" And so, Judas Iscariot goes to the Sanhedrin and says, ""Hey, I have this guy. Come and get him."" And they get Jesus and this is the famous trial of Jesus by the Sanhedrin. And they say, ""Hey, you've been saying all these things."
Social Studies,"We think you're blaspheming."" And Jesus stays silent for the most part. So, they deem him guilty and they hand him over to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate. And they say, ""Hey, look, this guy's trying to create an insurrection against Rome."" Which the Romans take very seriously. And, in the Bible, they have him seeming somewhat reluctantly saying, ""Oh, okay, do we really need to do this?"" But then he says, ""Alright, if that's the way you all want it."" And so, the Romans crucify Jesus."
Social Studies,"And this is what is now viewed as Good Friday, The crucifixion of Jesus. And then, on Sunday, and this was predicted by Jesus to his followers, he is resurrected. He leaves the tomb where he was. And this is a very important week. You have Palm Sunday. You have Good Friday. And then, you have the resurrection. And then, another very, very important event to Christians is 40 days after the resurrection. So, after 40 days... Over that 40 days after the resurrection, he's seen by his followers."
Social Studies,"He's seen by many people. He continues to preach. And then, you have the ascension where he goes to the kingdom of heaven. Now, I'm gonna leave you with a quote by a famous Christian historian. And it's a fascinating one. And it's very clear, because we just talked about the crucifixion and you see a cross at every church. ""Christianity is the only major religion to have as its central event the humiliation of its God."" That's Doctor Bruce Shelley."
Social Studies,And whether you believe in Christianity or you don't believe. Whether you're an atheist. Whether you believe in the miracles or you don't. It's worth pointing out that Christianity has grown from this religion that started around this preacher in Galilee and Judea and now has over two billion adherents.
Social Studies,"And what was it about this religion and its central event being the humiliation of its God that made it so appealing to many, especially in that early Roman Empire, both to Jews and to non-Jews, to Gentiles, and has made it such a significant religion?."
Social Studies,"When we looked at the Gospels, which are the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, the first four books of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, we talk about the 12 disciples, those primary followers of Jesus. They're often referred to as the 12 Apostles, as well, because according to Christian beliefs, between the resurrection and the ascension of Jesus, he tells the apostles, look, go spread the word. Apostle comes from Greek for the one who spreads the word."
Social Studies,"These were the first Christian missionaries. Now, first amongst these apostles is often considered Peter. This is Peter, right over here. He is mentioned in the Gospels. He is beside Jesus at the time of the Transfiguration. Amongst Roman Catholics, he is viewed as the first Pope, and he is really the head of the church of the Christian followers, and they're not even called Christians at this point, in Jerusalem, right over here."
Social Studies,"But we're gonna talk about another significant apostle, as well, in this video, and that is Paul. As we'll see, Paul is not mentioned in the first four books of the Bible, he wasn't a contemporary of Jesus, or, at least, he didn't know Jesus during his life."
Social Studies,"He did live at the same time, and you can see it on this timeline where Jesus is born slightly before the Common Era, I start at year one, because there isn't a year zero, and you can see that Peter is born, historians believe, around 1 AD, and Paul would have been born shortly after that. What's interesting about Paul is, Paul starts his life as a very conservative Pharisee. He starts his life persecuting Christian people, and then he has a fairly dramatic switch."
Social Studies,"You'll often hear Paul, or you might also hear the name Saul, or Paul of Tarsus, these are all referring to the same person. Tarsus is right over here, in modern day Southern Turkey. Paul, as I mentioned, he grows up in a conservative Jewish family, but he also has Roman citizenship. That's why he has this Roman name, Paul, and he has his Hebrew name, Saul. He's educated in Jerusalem. He doesn't enter into the story until we get to the fifth book of the New Testament, the Acts of the Apostles."
Social Studies,"The Acts of the Apostles talks a lot about Peter, how he spreads the church, how he is persecuted, how he performs various miracles, but it also is where we get introduced to Paul. When we first see him, as I mentioned, he is persecuting Christians. As this Church of Jerusalem starts to get established, Peter puts a fellow by the name of Stephen in charge of distributing alms to widows that are coming to them."
Social Studies,"Stephen, and this is a narrative that you'll hear often in the New Testament, he starts to get on the nerves of the religious establishment, the Jewish religious establishment, who think that he's a blasphemer, that his beliefs are threatening them, and so there's this famous trial, once again, with the Sanhedrin, and the trial of Stephen."
Social Studies,"Here I have an account for him, of that trial, or near the end of that trial, from the book of Acts, and during that trial Stephen goes into this long account of what the teachings of Jesus are, and how they're justified by what is mentioned in the Old Testament. He actually does a fairly long account of it. He also is fairly rebellious."
Social Studies,"He says, look, you, the establishment, what prophet have you not persecuted before? This really angers them, and so we read from the book of Acts, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city, and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses lay their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul, and we see him right over here, depicted in this painting. Saul approved of their killing him. On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"All except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. He is a pretty fervent persecutor of Christians. It goes even further. Then, we read, we go on to read in the book of Acts, Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples."
Social Studies,"He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. As he neared Damascus on his journey, so this is going to be interesting thing. He's so fervent, he goes to the high priest, and says, I wanna persecute these Christians wherever they are. I wanna go to Damascus, and see if I can persecute them there."
Social Studies,"As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, ""Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"" This is an image of that, this narrative in the Bible. ""Who are you, Lord?"", Saul asked. ""I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,"" he replied. ""Now get up and go into the city,"" the city being Damascus, ""and you will be told what you must do."" Paul is blinded by this event. He's blind for three days."
Social Studies,"He goes to Damascus, and he is healed by a follower of Christ. At that moment, he completely does a 180. He goes from being one of the chief persecutors of the Christians, to being one of the chief believers, and he starts to aggressively spread the faith. So that brings us, so let's go to this map, because what's significant about Paul is Peter was, you can really view him as the first head of the church, especially after Jesus, but he primarily viewed it as something to spread amongst the Jewish people."
Social Studies,"There are events, for example, in Acts where he does realize, hey, maybe I should be, the word of Jesus should go beyond the Jewish people. It should go to the non-Jews, who are referred to as Gentiles. But Paul, and you can see on the map here, he has this revelation, I guess you could say, as he's approaching Damascus. He goes back to Jerusalem, and he tries to convince the other followers, and you can imagine they're quite skeptical of this person who is shortly before persecuting them."
Social Studies,"But he eventually convinces them, and he goes on multiple missionary journeys, spreading the faith. His center of operations is at Antioch, and he's a significant figure who helps build the church at Antioch. What's interesting about the Church of Antioch, it ends up being a very significant church, is that at Antioch, the Christians, or the Christian faith, is not just spread to the Jewish people, they're spread to the non-Jews, to the Gentiles."
Social Studies,"It's actually at the Church of Antioch that the followers of Jesus Christ, according to Biblical accounts, were first referred to as Christians. What you see on this map, here, are the various missionary journeys that Paul, who is a Roman citizen, was able, or Saul, depending on which name you want to use, was able to do through, especially the Eastern Roman Empire. In that mid 40s here, let me, in the mid 40s, right over here, he does a missionary journey."
Social Studies,"Once again, Antioch is his base, he goes to Cyprus, and southern, mid, what we would call Turkey today. In the early 50s, he goes on this fairly long journey through modern day Turkey, through Macedonia, through Greece. As he's doing this, he's spreading the word of Jesus Christ. He's starting to help establish churches in these significant places, Philippi, Thessalonica, Corinth, all of these various places. You see his third journey, here, very similar in path in yellow to the second journey."
Social Studies,"He does that in the late 50s CE. Once again, he's constantly establishing these churches. The important thing to realize about Paul, it's a controversy. To what degree should the teachings of Jesus be spread to the Gentiles, to the non-Jewish people? There are these famous debates, and Paul's view is, no, we should not force the Gentiles to do everything that the Jews have to do, the circumcision, the Jewish dietary laws. You could imagine, this doubly angers the church leaders."
Social Studies,"Not only is he spreading the word of Jesus, that has annoyed them to no end, but he also wants to spread it to the Gentiles, but he doesn't think that the Gentiles need to perform all of the things that the Jewish leaders believe are dictated by the laws of Moses, by the Jewish faith. And circumcision is actually a major debate. Circumcision, the dietary habits, et cetera, et cetera."
Social Studies,"Eventually, he goes back to Jerusalem to face this leadership, and now this is in the early 60s, and they, once again, they put him on trial. As a Jewish citizen, he says, hey, I have a right to see the Emperor. He is taken to Rome, and along the way they get caught in a storm, but eventually he makes his way to Rome, where he is held prisoner. It is believed that both Peter and Paul were killed by Nero. We talk in previous videos, the fire in 64 CE in Rome that destroys a large chunk of the city."
Social Studies,"Some people think Nero actually set the fire to clear some land so that he could build his palace. He famously blames the fire on Christians. There's a large purge of Christians that occur after that. A lot of accounts say that Peter was crucified by Nero. He requests, according to these accounts, to be crucified upside down, because he doesn't deserve to get the same crucifixion as Jesus, and Paul, some accounts say, that he was beheaded."
Social Studies,"Once again, they're dying in these Christian purges that Nero is performing. You can see it right over here, if those accounts are true. Now it's really interesting, I already talked about Paul being this missionary to the Gentiles. He is the one, especially at the Church of Antioch, where Christianity starts to really separate from Judaism, starts to become a faith in it's own right."
Social Studies,"That was even further accelerated in a few years after their death, or it might have been roughly coincident with their death, depending on when their deaths were. From 66 to 70, you have the Jewish rebellion, sometimes called the First Roman-Jewish War, and it ends with the Roman Empire destroying the temple at Jerusalem, the center of the Jewish faith. The second temple of Jerusalem, the one that was rebuilt, partially, by Cyrus the Great."
Social Studies,"So this causes the Jewish people to have to leave, and they no longer have this center of their people. You have the Jewish diaspora that gets spread throughout the Roman Empire, and other empires, like the Parthians in Persia. They really, there's a famous battle in 73 of Masada, this mountain fortress, where the Romans, essentially, well, it's a mass suicide, but it's this bloody extermination of the Jewish people in and around Jerusalem, so they are spread."
Social Studies,"That's, obviously, a significant series of events for the Jewish people, but it's also significant for Christianity, because Jerusalem was a center of the Christian faith. Now the Christian followers are going to be spread around, and many of these other places that Paul spread the Gospel, becomes centers of Christianity. Now to emphasize the importance of Paul to Christianity, this is a listing of the books of the Bible. Jesus, his life and teachings, is primarily coming from the Gospels, right here."
Social Studies,"Most of what I told you in this video, this is excerpts from the fifth book of the New Testament, Acts of the Apostles. Then, most modern orderings of the Bible, the next several, or many books, are called epistles, or letters. They're primarily the epistles of Paul, letters that he wrote to his followers in different places. You can see most of these names, these are cities that you see where Paul was a missionary."
Social Studies,"Corinthians, Corinth is right here, these are letters that Paul is sending to the church there. Galatians, you see Galatia right over here in central modern day Turkey. Ephesians in Ephesus, Philippians in Philippi, right over here, Colossians in Colossae, Thessalonians in Thessalonica, right over here. This is a major chunk of the Bible that is either written by Paul, or some people think it was written by Paul, or is ascribed to Paul."
Social Studies,"What I have here in this deeper orange, these are the books that historians think were actually written by Paul. This lighter orange, there are some debate, and the yellow ones are the ones where people think it probably wasn't written by Paul. As you can imagine, this is a significant chunk of the New Testament that was actually written or ascribed to Paul. He was really the significant missionary that created the Christian faith beyond the Jewish people.."
Social Studies,"we're talking about in the hundreds of followers. But in other videos, we talk about his apostles who start spreading the faith, not only to other Jews, but also to non-Jews, to gentiles. We talked about Emperor Nero and his famous purges of Christians, in particular, you have the famous Roman Fire, or The Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. that Nero blames on Christians, and he uses this to do significant purge in Rome. Many historians believe that the apostles Peter and Paul were killed during those purges."
Social Studies,"This is a painting of Nero using Christians lighting them alive to punish them for that fire. Now, other imperial acts that continue to have a significant effect on this very early Christian church. We talked about the destroying of the second temple in Jerusalem in 70 C.E., and that's under the reign of Vespasian. And this of course is a very significant event for the Jewish people, but it also has a significant effect on Christianity, because remember Christianity was really centered at Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"It was a sect of Christianity, or it was, it got its start as a sect of Christianity, but now, with the destruction of the temple, the Jews were dispersed from Jerusalem, and so were many of these early Christians. And so the centers of Christianity became throughout the empire, places like Antioch. And you continue to have a discomfort with Christians especially as they became more and more in number, and they started to have more and more power."
Social Studies,"And here you have these people who refused to obey the Roman gods, to do their rituals, to worship the Roman gods, and remember, even, there was emperor worship here. And the issue was more so than even the Jewish people, who, to a certain degree, kept to themselves, these Christians were missionaries. They were spreading their faith to Roman citizens. Families were being split apart, where some decided to become Christians and no longer follow these Roman practices."
Social Studies,"And so you have these various persecutions, and these various purges, and they get more and more significant as you go into the second and even to some degree in the third century as Christians become more and more prominent and more and more in number. Remember, they have this missionary zeal, and it really becomes a significant purge under the reign of Diocletian. In previous videos, we talk about Diocletian."
Social Studies,"He's the one that famously split the empire between east and west, but he's also famous for his purge of the Christians. The most extreme state-sponsored purges of Christians in the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"But what's interesting is right after, or shortly after those purges, we're talking a few decades here, the next empire that would, the next emperor who would have reign over the entire Roman Empire, would be Constantine, and at least relative to Christians, he would be the opposite of Diocletian, because as he's trying to consolidate his power in 312 C.E., you have the famous battle at the Milvian Bridge outside of, or entering into Rome."
Social Studies,"And in this battle, Constantine, he sees a vision of the Christian cross centered on the sun, and he thinks that that is a sign that he should fight under the cross. And he gets the symbols painted on his soldier's shield, and he's victorious. This date, 312, Milvian Bridge, The Battle at Milvian Bridge, is viewed as the beginning of Constantine's conversion to Christianity, viewing it as his chosen faith."
Social Studies,"In 313, the Roman emperor, or the empire, issues the edict of Milan, which officially makes Christianity OK. It legalizes Christianity, which is a big deal, because these folks have been persecuted all this time. They haven't been worshiping the Roman gods. Then in 325, Constantine goes even further, and he convenes the council of Nicea, where he brings the bishops from all of Christendom together, to start having a more unified belief system. They come up with a Nicean creed."
Social Studies,"A lot of the debate is whether Jesus, as son of God, should be considered equal to God or as God or a little less, as being the son, maybe if he is the son, maybe there was a time where there wasn't a son, and there was just God, but the Nicean Creed says no, they are one and the same, these two things are equivalent. And then Constantine, on his death bed, famously gets baptized, and becomes a Christian, the first Christian emperor of this gigantic Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"And so you can imagine, you have more and more followers of Christianity, but now, this is, so to speak, prime time. The emperor of the Roman, the emperor of the Roman Empire has converted to Christianity, and it's a legalized religion. And then that gets even more momentum when we get to the end of the fourth century."
Social Studies,"Emperor Theodosius, who is Christian, under him, it becomes the official religion of the Roman Empire, the same empire that at one point, Christianity was illegal, and it was being persecuted, now it was the official religion of the Roman Empire. Theodosius, I mention him in other videos, he was incidentally also the last emperor to rule over both Eastern and Western Roman Empires."
Social Studies,"So you have this empire that starts off very anti-Christian, actually in the beginning, they don't really take much note of what's going on in Judea and Galilee, but more and more, they start to persecute them. But we go a few hundred years into this, and it becomes a Christian empire.."
Social Studies,"As Constantine takes over, he becomes sympathetic to the Christians and he eventually becomes Christian himself. Even then, there was a lot of diversity within the Christian Church. There were debates about the nature of Jesus Christ relative to the Father, relative to the Holy Spirit. There were multiple sects of Christianity. And one in particular started to create a debate. There was a priest in Alexandria, which was one of the major cities of the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"Now remember, by this point, Rome of course is one of the most significant, if not the most significant city. Now Constantine sets up a capital at Byzantium, which will eventually be known as Constantinople. And Alexandria, which was originally founded by Alexander the Great, is also one of the significant cities of the Empire. And in Alexandria there is a Christian priest by the name of Arius, who has a view on Christ that becomes a bit of a controversy."
Social Studies,"And to understand that, here is an account of his writings, or his beliefs. So this is Arius of Alexandria. If the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows that He, the Son, had his substance from nothing. So, he's drawing a distinction between the essence of the Father and the Son, who's manifested as Jesus Christ."
Social Studies,"Now this is very controversial, because even his own bishop in Alexandria viewed the Father and the Son to be of the same substance. Now, today, you might say, hey, isn't this just word play? It feels like it's semantic, which is really debating around the meaning of words. But, at the end of the Roman Empire and as we get into the Middle Ages, this was a major issue of philosophical and it would sometimes bleed over into political debate."
Social Studies,"And so Constantine, who we mentioned has a sympathy towards the Christians, he allows Christianity to be tolerated, he does not like this idea of this debate and he wants to help unify the Christians. So, in 325 he calls the Council of Nicaea, to help resolve this controversy, which gets known as the Arian Controversy, named after Arius of Alexandria."
Social Studies,"Now it's worth mentioning, Arius wasn't the first person to make this argument, that the Father in some way was more divine than the Son, because He begat the Son, He existed before the Son. But this controversy really revolves around Arius, because he was especially persuasive about spreading this view of the relationship between the Father and the Son, manifested by Jesus."
Social Studies,"And at the Council of Nicaea, many of the bishops throughout Christendom are in attendance, it's known as the First Ecumenical Conference, the word ecumenical comes from the Greek word for the inhabited Earth. So you can view it as the Church leaders from the inhabited Earth, in order to create a consensus about what it means to be a Christian. And Arius of Alexandria was there to defend his position, but the majority of those there did not like his point of view."
Social Studies,"So they declared Arius' beliefs as heresy and they exile him. And to be very clear that they do not believe that the Son is of a different substance of the Father, they issue the Nicene Creed. So what I have here, this is known as the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed."
Social Studies,"And this is based on the Nicene Creed, which was established in 325, which was shorter, but then in 381, under Theodosius, you have your Second Ecumenical Council, which is held in Constantinople, to reaffirm some of the ideas of the Nicene Council. And so as I read this, keep a look out for some of these words, which were really put there to try to settle the Arian Controversy, to try to ensure that that type of belief does not surface again."
Social Studies,"We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, Begotten of the Father before all ages. So, not like Arius was arguing, that there was a time where the Father existed before the Son existed. Here it says begotten of the Father, but before all ages, so there was always a time when there was a Son."
Social Studies,"Light of Light, Very God of Very God, Begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by whom all things were made. So, once again, really addressing this Arian Controversy, the Arian Heresy as it becomes known, that the Father and the Son are of the same essence, one is not more divine than the other. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man."
Social Studies,"And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father. And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, Whose kingdom shall have no end. And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father."
Social Studies,"Now here in brackets I've written filoque and the son? Because even though the official Nicene- Constantinopolitan Creed just says Who proceeds from the Father, as we will see later on, as the Church starts to become more and more divided, in the West, in Latin, the term filoque gets added, which means and the son."
Social Studies,"And, once again, this is starting to address this notion of how does the Son relate to the Father? So, when you add filoque, you're saying, hey, the Holy Spirit is emanating from both the Father and the Son, versus just the Father, but we'll get into that. This was not a matter of debate in the 4th century, but it will become a matter of debate as we go into the 6th century and beyond. And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father."
Social Studies,"Who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, Who spoke by the Prophets. And we believe in one, holy, catholic, meaning universal, and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. We look for the Resurrection of the dead, and the life of the age to come, Amen. So this is interesting, because it's, you can view it as a unification of Christendom. Now, as we will see, that unification does not hold well over the next several hundred years."
Social Studies,"Even though Arius is exiled and he dies shortly thereafter, you continue to have sympathetic bishops and even Roman Emperors, to the Arian Doctrine. You also, this debate between the relation of the Father and the Son continues, we'll talk about this filoque debate. But maybe most important and the biggest cause of the eventual divisions between the Church, ones that carry on even to today, it's really about a power struggle."
Social Studies,"So, as we've been talking about the late Roman Empire and even the fall of the Western Empire and the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, you might already notice that there are several very powerful actors here. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, you have the Byzantine Emperor, who considers him, and as we'll see, also herself, the Roman Emperor. We have the Bishop, the Patriarch, or, often known, the Pope of Rome."
Social Studies,"Now Rome is significant, because according to tradition the Church at Rome was founded by the Apostle Peter, who is considered by many to be the first amongst the Apostles. But of course Rome was the seat of the Roman Empire for a very, very, very long time. And so you could imagine the Bishop of the Church of Rome, the Pope of Rome would be a very powerful figure. Now you also have the Bishop or the Patriarch of Constantinople, which is another capital and really the capital of the Byzantine Empire."
Social Studies,"And so what we're going to see, over the next several hundred years, is the jockeying for position amongst these three, in particular the Byzantine Emperor and the Pope of Rome. The Pope of Rome starts to consider themselves as really the leader of all of Christendom."
Social Studies,"The Patriarch of Constantinople and the bishops of the other major centers of Christianity, like Antioch and Jerusalem and Alexandria, they view themselves as all kind of a college of, as peers and they will give extra space for the Pope of Rome or the Bishop of Rome, because of the importance of that city and the significance of how the Church of Rome was founded."
Social Studies,"And this gets, this jockeying for power over the next several hundred years gets even more complex as the West, what was the Western Roman Empire, or some of the areas of the Western Roman Empire, start to get consolidated under Germanic rule really, Frankish rule and you start having this notion of a Holy Roman Emperor that we'll talk about in a few hundred years down our timeline. So, keep a look out for this power struggle."
Social Studies,"We're going to talk about particular issues of theological doctrine, things like the filoque issue, things like the relationship between the Father and the Son, whether you should have icons. But, at the end of the day, what's eventually going to lead to the Great Schism, in the beginning of the Second Millennium, is this power struggle.."
Social Studies,"We believe that there were settlements in this region as early as 2000 ... As early as 2000 B.C.E., and then we have the emergence of the first cities around 750 B.C.E.. And even then there are signs of significant cultural advancements. There's evidence that there was a sophisticated base-20 numeral system that included the use of place value as early as 1000 B.C.E.."
Social Studies,"To put that in context, the Hindu Arabic numeral system which we now use, and most of the world now uses, it wasn't devised, we don't believe, until about 1000 years later, and it wasn't adopted in Europe until about 2000 years after the time where we see the first evidence of this Mayan numeral system, this base-20 system that had place value. Now, around the third century B.C.E., so roughly in this time period right over here, we see the first writing. These are examples of what a Mayan glyph looks like."
Social Studies,"So that is a Mayan glyph, and you read it in order like this. And once again, this is a very early form of writing, and it's believed to be the first form of writing, well-established writing, in the Americas. Now, on top of their sophisticated numeral system and the writing that they developed, they also had a very sophisticated calendar."
Social Studies,"Their calendar was more accurate than the Julian calendar, which was adopted by Julius Caesar, and that was the state of the art in the western world until the middle of the second millennium. So their calendar was more accurate than what was used in most of the world until around 1500 or 1600. Now, as we get into 250 in the Common Era, that's considered the classical period. That's when some of their really great cities start to emerge, cities like Tikal and Calakmul."
Social Studies,"My apologies ahead of time for the pronunciation. It is believed that at their peak, these cities had 50,000 to 100,000 people. Now, what we now believe is that it was not one unified empire, that there wasn't a Mayan empire with a centralized emperor, but rather, it was closer to the Greek city-states, where each of these cities were their own state."
Social Studies,"Their more powerful cities, like Tikal or Calakmul, might have had influence or sway over others, but it wasn't a unified empire in the sense of the Roman Empire or the Persian Empire or some of the early Indian empires. Now, it is believed that each of these city-states, they did have a king who was not only a political ruler but also a spiritual ruler, considered a divine king, a connection between the natural and the supernatural."
Social Studies,"We have evidence that they practiced human sacrifice as part of their believe system, as part of their rituals. Now, near the end of the fourth century, there's evidence that there was significant influence or even conquering of some of these cities by another civilization, or maybe we could say another city, and that is Teotihuacan."
Social Studies,"We know that it was a very powerful city, and that, in the fourth century, it started to really exert significant influence, and just to get a sense of the sophistication of what Mayan cities look like, and I'll show you what we believed Teotihuacan looked like in a second, but this is a construction of what Tikal might have looked like near its peak. And Teotihuacan, we have significant ruins there."
Social Studies,"Teotihuacan, as you can see, is based near modern-day Mexico City, and these are the ruins from Teotihuacan. Just to get a sense of how sophisticated a city this was, this is a reconstruction of the map of the city. So the vantage point that you have from this picture would have been roughly in that area, so what you're seeing right over here are these ... These buildings, or these little squares here. This pyramid that you see out in the distance, that would have been this pyramid."
Social Studies,"So you can see from this reconstruction of what the city might have looked like, it was a vast and significant city. Pretty much everything that you can see in this picture was part of this great city. It was believed that it was established around 150 B.C.E., based on our best evidence today, and lasted until about the middle of the sixth century. Now, they name Teotihuacan, we don't ... That's not its original name."
Social Studies,"It's the name given to it by the Aztecs, but it's believed that at its peak around 400, 450, and remember, this was around the time that it was exerting significant influence over the Mayans, it is believed that it had upwards of 100,000 people living in the city. 100,000 to 200,000. I've even seen some accounts saying 250,000 people, which would have made it, at the time, one of the largest cities in the world. Some accounts have it ranked as the sixth largest city in the world that we know about."
Social Studies,"Now, one interesting question was, was Teotihuacan an independent city-state by itself, or was it the center of an empire? This is something that historians debate today. Now, some of the evidence for why it was maybe a center of an empire is it's believed it was a multiethnic city. We see its influence over the Mayan cities, especially over Tikal, as we get into the end of the fourth century."
Social Studies,"We also see this incredible confluence of people and culture and trade at Teotihuacan, which, once again, hints that it probably wasn't a standalone city, but it was probably the center of some type of regional influence, or maybe an empire. We don't traditionally see cities of that size form unless they are the center of a larger empire, and they're able to get tribute or taxation from other states. Now, Teotihuacan ends up declining or falling before the Mayan civilization."
Social Studies,"You see Teotihuacan in this blue-green line. You see the Mayan civilization in this light blue, and then in the classical period, this slightly darker light blue. And Teotihuacan collapses around 550 in the Common Era, and the best theories we have today is that it might have been some type of an internal uprising, maybe due to some type of drought and famine, and you can imagine, people will revolt if they're not able to get enough food."
Social Studies,"Now, the Mayan civilization, it is believed, also started to collapse a few hundred years after that. So as we get into the 800s, the Mayan civilization, we believe, might have experienced some similar things, maybe some drought, some famine, that similarly caused uprisings, division, and allowed that to collapse. Now, there is evidence of some of these cities lasting beyond the classical period, all the way up until you have the European colonization of the region."
Social Studies,"We'll talk more about that and some of the successor states, like the Aztecs, who considered themselves a bit of a successor state to the civilization or to the city of Teotihuacan, and we'll look at that in future videos.."
Social Studies,"Instead, this area is really defined by the Humboldt Current. The Humboldt Current is a current that comes up from the south and off the coast of what is modern-day Peru for the most part, it brings all these nutrients from the bottom of the ocean. And what it does is it makes it a very powerful fishery, so there's a lot of fish in the ocean in this part of the world. And it also has interesting effects on the climate on land."
Social Studies,"So in this region, you can see even on this map, there's this thin strip of desert, and then you get into the Andes Mountains, and on the other side of the Andes Mountains, you start to have the tropical rainforest. So if you go to Peru, especially on the western part of Peru, the ocean will look like this. This is actually a picture I took from a recent family trip to Peru."
Social Studies,"Then, as you get right onto the coast, it will be pretty arid desert, and then when you get up into the mountains, they're fairly high altitude, you'll have these mountain valleys, some of them are at 7,000, 8,000, 9,000 feet. This is actually another picture that I took from my recent vacation in Peru a few months ago. And what's interesting about the ancient civilizations there is some of them might have settled on the coast to take advantage of the fishing that was available."
Social Studies,"There were some rivers, or there continue to be some rivers, that go from the mountains through the desert, so some early agriculture developed around that. But there's also civilizations that developed around these high altitude valleys. And what's really interesting about these civilizations is because of the terrain, they weren't as unified as things we might see in Mesoamerica."
Social Studies,"So one of the first civilizations in the all Americas that we have archeological evidence of is the Caral or Norte Chico civilization. And one thing to keep in mind, as I give the names of these civilizations, this is not what they called themselves. The civilizations tend to be named after the most significant archeological locations that people have found. And now as we get into the first millennium BCE, we have what's called the Chavin civilization. Once again, it wasn't their name."
Social Studies,"This was about 3,000 years ago. And to be clear, this is when we just start to see that civilization getting quite advanced. There's evidence that people had been settled in this area around modern-day Peru and Bolivia and northern Chile and Ecuador for potentially thousands of years before that. But just to get a sense of the Chavin civilization, here are some archeological artifacts discovered."
Social Studies,"And they were discovered at Chavin de Huantar, thus the name Chavin civilization, sometimes called Chavin culture. And what's interesting is we have these artifacts, it looks like it was a religious cultural center. Some people refer to it as a religious cult that really took off in this area, but we don't believe that it was a formal empire. We don't know for certain, because we don't have written records, so we're just trying to figure out what we can from the archeological evidence."
Social Studies,"Now, near the time that the Chavin culture started to decline, and what's interesting, we believe that a lot of these cultures declined either from warfare between themselves or some type of climate change, whether it was the El Niño or some type of drought or famine and maybe that could actually cause a lot of the conflict within a society as well, but those are some of the leading theories as to why the Chavin culture ended around 200 BCE."
Social Studies,"Now around that time, we start to see the emergence of several other cultures. You have the famous Nazca culture emerge right over here in southwest Peru. And they're most famous, perhaps, for the Nazca Lines, these huge, I guess you say drawings, or patterns, that are made in the land. Some of them are 300 meters, a third of a kilometer, and you really can't even appreciate what they represent unless you're looking at it from a significant altitude."
Social Studies,"Some people have theorized that this is some type of message they're trying to send to the sky gods. Some people have even thought, hey, maybe this has something to do with trying to communicate with aliens. This is famously called the Space Man. Who knows, it's interesting to theorize about that Nazca civilization, which started to emerge around 200 BCE. Once again, we don't have written record, so we can just look at their architecture, these patterns that they created."
Social Studies,"Now a little bit later, we start to see the emergence of the Moche civilization or the Moche culture in this area in light blue over here, sometimes called Mochica. And this is one of the significant structures they built, Hauca del Sol, known as the Temple of the Sun, and it's been damaged a lot, oftentimes by people who are trying to loot it or excavate it in irresponsible ways, but it was the largest structure we have found from pre-Colombian America."
Social Studies,"When we say pre-Colombian America, we're saying before Christopher Columbus got to America. The Moche are really interesting. Even though they didn't have writing, we can learn a lot from their art and this is some examples of it and frankly this is some of the less graphic examples of it. Now, as we get into the first millennium, especially the middle part of the first millennium, we start to see some other significant cultures and civilizations emerge."
Social Studies,"So, for example, around 500 CE, so roughly 1500 years ago, you see the Wari civilization emerge, and that's here in red. And there's some debates and you'll see these debates a lot as we study ancient history. Was it an empire or was it just a culture that had a lot of influence? Some of the arguments for empire are it seemed like there was wealth, it seemed like they were able to build large infrastructure works, there was consistency across different settlements."
Social Studies,"Now there's also the Tiwanaku, and we believe it was truly an empire, but we can say the Tiwanaku civilization, right over here in yellow, really centered at off the coast of Lake Titicaca, which is right in that area right over here. But the big take away here is this is just a sample of some of the civilizations that you had in this part of the world."
Social Studies,"Now what's really interesting is, as I mentioned, a lot of them weren't able to form formal empires, people think because of the valley, the mountains, the terrain, that were keeping people from maybe trading or being able to control each other a little bit more strongly. But eventually we do have the emergence of fairly strong empires, as we see in the Incas, which emerges in the 15th century, around 1438. And then the Inca empire ends with the European colonization of the Americas."
Social Studies,"And we also believe that the Tiwanaku were a significant empire, despite some of the geographical hurdles.."
Social Studies,"But we can see that his, his life and his teachings were roughly 150 to 200 years before the establishment of the Maurya Empire which lasts for another 150 or so years. And this is important to keep in mind, because as we'll see, Buddhism has a strong influence on the Maurya Empire, and maybe just as important, the Maurya Empire has a very large influence on spreading Buddhism in a very significant way. So let's zoom in on what the Indian subcontinent looked like near the end of the fourth century BCE."
Social Studies,"So, in most of north India you have control by the Nanda Empire, which had its capital at the city Pataliputra, which was in the region, or the kingdom, of Magada, which is this ancient region that has been the seat of power in north India for some time. You also have other kingdoms, like Kalinga. You have several kingdoms in south India, as well. There are counts of a kingdom potentially quite powerful in Bengal named the Gangaridai."
Social Studies,"You also might remember in our videos on Alexander the Great that it was around this time, around 326, that Alexander came and conquered much of modern day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and was at the borders of the Nanda Empire in India. And you might also remember that that was about the time that Alexander the Great and his soldiers decided to stop. They were tired, some accounts are that they were fearful of trying to conquer another empire, especially that far from home."
Social Studies,"So it was also around the time that Alexander the Great decided to turn back, and leave the region under the control of some of his governors and generals. And it was in that context that the Maurya Empire emerges. And the actual events of how it emerges are still shrouded in history a little bit."
Social Studies,"But what eventually happens is a conqueror by the name of Chandragupta Maurya is able to conquer the Nanda Empire, and then not just the Nanda Empire, but as Alexander the Great retreats, he is able to conquer some of the territory former, formerly conquered by Alexander the Great."
Social Studies,"And so this here is a statue of what Chandragupta Maurya may have looked like, and you can see by within a decade of establishing the empire, it had conquered most of the Nanda Empire, and had even reclaimed a significant amount of land from the Greeks from what would eventually become the Seleucid Empire. Remember, Seleucus was one of Alexander's generals, who essentially sets up a dynasty in Persia, the Middle East, after the death of Alexander."
Social Studies,"And Chandragupta Maurya actually fights several battles with Seleucus, and is victorious, and he actually marries one of Seleucus' daughters. But this is what essentially establishes the Maurya, sometimes referred to or as, the Mauryan Empire. Now Chandragupta Maurya in 297, or roughly in 297, he, he decides to become a more devout Jain, and in other videos we'll talk about Mahavira and the Jain religion."
Social Studies,"But he essentially becomes an ascetic and leaves the kingdom, or the empire, in the hands of his son Bindusara. Now, Bindusara is able to conquer more of India, in particular he starts growing the empire into the south. But Bindusara is not able to conquer the kingdom of Kalinga. Bindusara dies in around 273, or 272 BCE, and then a civil war erupts for who should take charge, and the civil war is essentially amongst the sons of Bindusara. But the son who is victorious ends up being Ashoka."
Social Studies,"Now Ashoka is one of, if not, the most significant historical character in the history of India. So, Ashoka is able to take power roughly around 270 BCE, after as legend has it, a fairly bloody civil war. Early in his life he is viewed as a potentially cruel figure, killing many of his brothers in order to come to power, and he is set on conquering the kingdom of Kalinga."
Social Studies,"So, in 262, 261, he has a significant war, and he is able to successfully conquer the kingdom of Kalinga, which is this area right over here. Now, that ends up, according to historical records and really Ashoka's own accounts, ends up becoming a significant turning point in the life of Asoka, and potentially in the life of India or the world, because here are his direct accounts of his feelings about what happened in Kalinga. And we get this account from what are known as Ashoka edicts."
Social Studies,"As the Maurya Empire expanded under Ashoka, it had peace and prosperity. He put his edicts throughout the empire on what are often known as Ashoka pillars, where he wrote what his beliefs and the things that he did. He would also write them on rocks and stone throughout the empire. But this is the one where he talks about the conquering of Kalinga, and it's pretty interesting."
Social Studies,"Beloved of the Gods King Piyadasi, and he refers to himself as beloved of the Gods King Piyadasi, conquered the Kalingas eight years after his coronation. And so you see he was coronated roughly in 270. He conquers roughly in 262. 150,000 were deported, 100,000 were killed, and many more died from other causes. After the Kalingas had been conquered, beloved of the Gods came to feel, he's talking about himself, beloved of the Gods came to feel a strong inclination towards the Dhamma."
Social Studies,"So Dhamma is the same word that we use today, dharma. And dharma you could ref, you can, you can view it as the cosmic order of things. It also, to a Buddhist, refers to the teachings of Buddha, or the Buddhist religion. So, beloved of the Gods came to feel a strong inclination towards the Dhamma, a love for the Dhamma, and for the instruction in Dhamma. Now beloved of the Gods feels deep remorse for having conquered the Kalingas. So this is really interesting."
Social Studies,"You don't have a lot of conquerors, especially in ancient history, after killing several hundred thousand, or maybe being responsible for the death of several hundred thousand, for feeling remorse about it, and writing about it. And so not only is this profound to be coming from a conqueror, but also reminds us how bloody some of these ancient wars were. But this is a turning point for him. He turns to Buddhism, and he really then becomes anti violence, not just towards humans, but even towards animals."
Social Studies,"He becomes a devoted Buddhist, and sponsors Buddhist temples throughout his empire. He sends Buddhist missionaries throughout the world, and is viewed as one of the main people responsible for the spread of Buddhism from Europe all the way to the far east. We already talked about his edicts of Ashoka. He started doing a bunch of public works projects, digging of wells, hospitals, and public gardens, education including for women."
Social Studies,"During his reign you have the maximum extent of any empire that ever ruled over India. 50% larger than modern, than the modern day country of India. There were roughly 50 million people under the Mauryan Empire under his rule. Now, eventually after his death, the empire goes under weaker and weaker rulers, and by about 184, 185 BCE, it falls to another less significant dynasty in the whole scope of history. But just to appreciate what a big deal Ashoka is in the scope of history, here is a quote by H.G."
Social Studies,"Wells from his Outline of History. ""Ashoka worked for the real needs of men. Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, the name of Asoka, or Ashoka, shines, and shines almost alone, a star. From the Volga to Japan his name is still honored."" A lot because of his spread of Buddhism."
Social Studies,"""More living men cherish his memory today than have ever heard the name of Constantine or Charlemagne."" And just to appreciate the impact of Ashoka, even on modern day India, and this right over here is called the Ashoka chakra, and if you look at the flag of India, the Ashoka chakra sits at the center of it, and this is actually part of the, the modern day emblem of the republic of India, because after his turn to becoming a more benevolent ruler, he's considered as the model, ideal ruler in Indian history, and by many historians in all of history.."
Social Studies,"It's believed that its start was with Sri Gupta, he started the Gupta Dynasty around 240, and it's disputed where they emerged, it might have been in that region or in that region. There's different accounts of where the Gupta Dynasty initially emerged, but even in the early 300's, they really had a control of a few small kingdoms. It wasn't until the reign of Chandragupta I that it becomes a significant dynasty. We need to be careful."
Social Studies,"Don't confuse this Chandragupta, the First, with Chandragupta Maurya, who founded the Maurya Dynasty over 600 years before the time we're talking about. Chandragupta I, it's interesting because he is really able to gain power, not initially through conquest, but through a marriage. He has a marriage with the princess Kumaradevi, and as a dowry, he's given control over much of this region of northeast India."
Social Studies,"This region of Magadha or Magadha, I am always having trouble pronouncing that, so my apologies, including the famous city of Pataliputra, which even at the time of the Maurya Empire and before the Maurya Empire, this was a famous seat of power. But once he's in control of this region, then he and his successors are able to have increased conquests over India."
Social Studies,"You see in this light blue color what his son Samudragupta was able to do, and then one of Samudragupta's sons, Chandragupta II, is able to conquer even more. But what makes the Gupta Empire distinctive isn't just that they were able to unify much, or conquer much, of India again. What really makes them distinctive is because of that unification, and especially the wealth that began to flow into the capitol, they were able to be sponsors of significant culture, and science, and the arts."
Social Studies,"That's why historians view the Gupta Empire as the golden age of India. Just to get an appreciation for this, the Gupta Empire was during the time of Kalidasa, and he is considered to be the greatest writer ever in the Sanskrit language. He is the William Shakespeare of Sanskrit. Beyond literature and writing, you have significant contributions to science, most notably, Aryabhata."
Social Studies,"He's known for a very accurate approximation of pi, but even more important, a recognition that was an approximation, and that he potentially recognized the irrationality of pi, one of the first to do so. The word sin, the trig function, is derived from Aryabhata's word for that function, so he established some of the early ideas of trigonometry. He did work in summation, he did significant astronomical work, recognizing the rotation of the Earth versus the rotation of the heavens."
Social Studies,"He had an early concept of gravity. Even some of these notions of the place value system, and zero, and decimal notation, many of our modern notions of it are traced back to Aryabhata. In other videos on the Islamic golden age, when we talk about folks like al-Khwarizmi, a lot of his work was based on what he learned from Aryabhata."
Social Studies,"Beyond the sciences, and once again, this is just a sample of all that happened during this period, you have the significant Hindu epics, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, the Periyas, get written down and formalized. You can say they were canonized."
Social Studies,"The game of chess, or the early version of the game of chess, was invented, called chaturanga, and they had horsemen, which were the knights, they had infantry, which were the pawns, they had elephants, which eventually turned into bishops, but as it migrated into Persia, the Muslim world, and then into Europe, it became our modern game of chess."
Social Studies,"Famously, there is this iron pillar, that is now in New Delhi, that is traced back to the time of the Gupta Empire, and is believed to the reign of Chandragupta II. What's amazing about this, this is a pillar that's over 20 feet high, made out of raw iron, and over 1500, 1600 years, it hasn't corroded. It has inscriptions on it that help historians point to the Gupta Empire. This is some of the coinage of the Gupta Empire."
Social Studies,"So the big takeaway here is, this was India's golden age, the classical period of India. A lot of modern Hinduism and Indian culture can be traced back to this time period. But it isn't just its influence on India."
Social Studies,"In other videos, we talk about the Islamic golden age, and much of that golden age, which emerges two, three, 400 years after the time, after the Gupta Empire falls, much of that work in based on the discoveries and the work that is collected during the time of the Guptas, and then that becomes a bridge, eventually, to the European Renaissance."
Social Studies,"Now, like all empires, the Gupta Empire does eventually fall, in the mid-sixth century, it's believed around 540, 550, and one of the main causes, there is invasions from people called the Hunas, who historians believe are either the Huns, or a group that are closely related to the Huns. It's considered to be one of the causes of the eventual decline of the Gupta Dynasty.."
Social Studies,"Might have been climate change, drying up of a river. Might have been a natural disaster. It might have been an influence of other peoples. We're gonna talk about in this video is the next significant period in the history of South Asia, and it involves the migration or the introduction of another group of people, we believe another group of people, and that's the Indo-Aryans. Write this down."
Social Studies,"Indo-Aryans, sometimes referred to as just the Aryans, who we believe began to migrate into modern-day Pakistan and northwest India at right about the same time that the Indus Valley Civilization was declining. Some historians actually believe maybe Indus Valley Civilization declined because of them. Maybe it was some type of an invasion. Although that theory is not as widely held anymore. Some folks believe that the Indus Valley Civilization and this Indo-Aryan migration somehow merged."
Social Studies,"But this period that we're talking about, with the migration of these Indo-Aryans, this is called the Vedic Period, or the Vedic Period. It's called the Vedic Period because we learn about it from a collection of literary works that we get from that time, most famously the Vedas. Veda comes from Sanskrit, and Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas. Vedas, in Sanskrit, means: knowledge."
Social Studies,"And they're the foundation of, one, what we know about the Vedic Period, but they're also the foundation of modern Indian culture and religion. The primary pieces of the Vedas are the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda, and the Atharvaveda.. The Rigveda in particular is considered the oldest of the Vedas. It's believed that it was composed around the early part of that Vedic Period, between maybe 1500 BCE and around 1200 BCE."
Social Studies,"We're talking between 3,000 and 3500 years ago, while these three Vedas we believe were composed later. Now, these Indo-Aryans, it's believed, were essentially pastoralists; they were cattle herders, perhaps nomadic. But as they began to settle not just the Indus River Valley, they actually began to settle the entire Gangetic Plain, which would include this area, which would be northeast India as well as countries like Bangladesh. The Indus and the Ganges are two of the most significant rivers in India."
Social Studies,"But as they started to settle the Gangetic Plain they also became more traditional farmers. In this green here, I've highlighted when they became more farmers, and started to have more settled kingdoms, or we believe started to have more settled kingdoms. Other significant Hindu epics, we believe the events of the them happened around that late Vedic Period. The events of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Now, the Vedas and these epic poems were originally orally transmitted."
Social Studies,"But then, later, either in the late Vedic Period or after the Vedic Period was when they were actually written down. Just so you have some context here, Sanskrit is considered one of the oldest Indo-European languages we have. I'll talk more about Indo-European languages in a little bit. Because it turns out that Sanskrit is related to European languages like Greek and Latin and even Germanic languages. Sanskrit's one of the oldest, alongside Mycenaean Greek and the Hittite Language."
Social Studies,"Those were all contemporary civilizations of around this period right over here, in the Second Millennium BCE. Just so have you context, Siddhartha Gautama Buddha, his life was in one of these Vedic kingdoms in the northeast of India. Now, as I mentioned, the Vedas laid the foundation for much of what we consider to be modern-day India. In fact, the first documented reference to the Indus River we have from the Vedas. The Indus Valley Civilization, we haven't been able to decipher their writing."
Social Studies,"They didn't write down the word Indus. It was in the Vedas that we have the word sindhu, and sindhu was later changed or mispronounced or pronounced differently into other words that we now associate with India. Words like Hindu, Indus, and India, they all derived from Sindhu, which was the River referred to in the Vedas, and then changed into Hindu, Indus, and things like India."
Social Studies,"Now, also in the Vedas is the first time that we have reference to a stratified social structure, and we see that with the varnas that are referred to. You could view these as social roles or classes. At the top you have the brahmins: the priests, the scholars, and the teachers. Then the next you have the kings and the warriors referred to as the kshatriyas. Then the vaishyas, who are the farmers, the merchants, the artisans. Then the shudras: the laborers."
Social Studies,"Now, some historians and Vedic scholars believe that these reference to the varnas were added after the Vedic Period to things like the Rigveda; and some believe that these weren't traditional casts, as it's sometimes perceived today, but just a reference to different social strata, that it wasn't necessarily inherited. We are not actually sure about that. But just to give you a feel of what was in the Rigveda. I encourage you to go look at the actual primary text, and there's a lot out there to read."
Social Studies,"It includes prayers; it includes praise of the gods; it includes rituals; but it also has a lot of interesting philosophy. And, for example, this is from the Rigveda. This is a hymn referred to as Nasadiya Sukta, and it's in the 10th book, the 129th hymn. I find it really interesting because it shows a fairly mature philosophical attitude. This is actually the origin hymn, and this is just a part of it. We're talking about the origin of the universe."
Social Studies,"""Who really knows? ""Who will here proclaim it? ""Whence was it produced? ""Whence is this creation? ""Gods came afterward, with the creation of this universe. ""Who then knows whence it has arisen? ""Whether God's will created it, or whether He was mute. ""Perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not. ""Only He who is the overseer in highest heaven knows."
Social Studies,"""Only He knows, or perhaps He does not know."" I just find it interesting because it takes a very philosophical view towards this very fundamental question of the origin of the actual universe. So the Vedic Period, very important period in India. It really lays the foundation for what we consider to be modern Hinduism, modern-day India. It starts as really a Bronze-Age civilization, but as we get into the later Vedic Period, we see them smelting iron, and creating iron tools, and things like that."
Social Studies,"And, as we'll see in the next video, the language of the Vedas, the Sanskrit, when Western scholars started to discover it, it opened up their minds as to what were the roots of many of the peoples who settle not just north India but also Europe.."
Social Studies,"So, this is a quote in 1786 by the English philologist, someone who studies written languages especially from historical sources, Sir William Jones. He wrote, “The Sanskrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of wonderful structure."
Social Studies,"More perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refine than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity both in the roots of the verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could not possibly have been produced by accident...” Let me underline that."
Social Studies,"“…than could not possibly have been produced by accident.” So he says there’s a lot of commonality between the Sanskrit and Latin and Greek, and it’s a strong affinity, a strong connectedness that could not have produced by accident. So strong indeed, that no philologer could examine all three without believing them to have sprung from some common source."" Let me underline that."
Social Studies,"“Without believing them to have sprung from some common source which, perhaps no longer exists; there is a similar reason though not quit so forcible for supposing that both the Gothic and the Celtic, though blended with a very different idiom had the same origin with the Sanskrit; and the old Persian might be added to the same family.” And so when they started to study the Vedas and look at the Sanskrit, they started to realize well maybe all of these languages are connected."
Social Studies,"And now modern day philologists believe this very strongly the more they have studied it. Based on the connections and the grammar and even the vocabulary and the word structure themselves, they now theorize that a parent language of Sanskrit, Latin, and the Germanic languages and the Celtic languages recall a language today called Proto-Indo–European, which is a lost language. But we think that Sanskrit is one of the oldest… Is one of the oldest evidences that we have of that Proto-Indo-European Language."
Social Studies,"Sanskrit as of course the parent language has evolved in different parts of Indian to languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Punjabi. Latin, which is also a dead language now, has evolved into languages like Spanish, Italian, and French. And English which is considered a Germanic language structurally, but has significant influence from Latin and French, they all come from that same Proto-Indo-European root."
Social Studies,"And just to get an appreciation for why these philologist believe this, and this is something when I first saw it, really blew my mind a little bit. I’ll show you some connections between Sanskrit words, and those of you who might be Hindi, Bengali or Punjabi speakers, or any of these North Indian languages in India, will see the connection to Sanskrit. But what’s amazing is how these words are connected to Latin and many of the languages derived from Latin."
Social Studies,"Some of your Persian speakers might recognize some, some commonalities and, most importantly, the language that we are speaking right now, how to relate it to English. And here is just a sample of some Sanskrit words that have an eerie resemblance to both English and in some cases Latin words. Or many cases Latin words. I’ve just given Latin in a few of them. So the Sanskrit matr, well in English we have mother and in Latin we have mater."
Social Studies,"And we also from Latin in English via Latin, we have words like maternity and maternal all referring to the same idea of motherhood. And this general trend, this t sound, matr or mater becoming of more of a tha sound in English and the Germanic languages is a trend you’ll see over and over again. In Sanskrit you have pithr, in Latin you have pater, and by way of Latin in modern English we have words like paternity and paternal."
Social Studies,"But going through the Germanic languages you have once again that tha sound becoming more of a tha sound. And you also see this pattern as you go from this Proto-Indo-European, this theoretical language, and especially if you think about relative to Sanskrit, that you have the sound going from a pa to a fa as you go to the Germanic languages. So pithr becomes, you could say it father. And other words."
Social Studies,"Na in Sanskrit…and those of you who speak Hindi or Bengali would recognize that of course, and in English it is no. Gau which is still, it’s a Hindi word for cow, in English it’s cow. Gau , cow. Naama,name. In Latin nomen. Dwar, door. This one I thought was really interesting. I didn’t know this until I started looking it up a little bit. Anamika is Sanskrit, and it means anonymous."
Social Studies,"Kaal, which is referring to time in Sanskrit and in modern Sanskrit drive languages like Hindi and Bengali it’s referring to references in time; tomorrow, yesterday. And in English you have calendar. Naas and in something like, in modern languages in the sub-continent and you have naas, and in English you have nose. Loc in...in English you have the prefix loc, as in location or locate. And then this is of course a very nice one, Sanskrit lubh, which means desire, well in English we have the word love."
Social Studies,"And this is just a sample, I encourage you to look it up more, you’ll be amazed by the connections between Sanskrit and English. And now I'm going to show you what I think is one of the coolest, because it isn’t just a linguistic connection, but it is also a, I guess you could say spiritual connection. And this is the names for the sky god from several different traditions So in the Vedas they make reference to a god, Dyauspithr, and it’s literally referring to Dyaus, referring to sky."
Social Studies,"And we already talked about Pithr been the word for father. So it’s referring to this idea of sky father. And some of you might be getting goosebumps now when you see where this is going. Well, in Greek we have a very similar word, instead of Dyaus we have Zeus and those are very similar words. The spelling might be different, but with the way it comes out of your mouth is very similar. Dyaus, Dyaus, instead of Pithr you have Pater, once again you have sky, you have sky father, sky father right over here."
Social Studies,"And this is another connection that blew my mind. It wasn’t obvious when I first saw it, but Jupiter from Latin, the Roman god, you could use Jupiter. This is once again instead of Zeus you have Dyau, instead of Pater you have Pitr. So, instead of Dyauspitr you have Jupiter. Dyauspitr, Jupiter. These are very very similar words even though the spelling seems different, the way it comes out of your mouth is very very very very very close."
Social Studies,"And this is further evidence for the closeness between Sanskrit, between Greek, and between Latin. So once again, we have sky father. And this of course an image of… well it’s hard to tell whether that’s Jupiter or Zeus. I believe that is a picture of Jupiter. And what’s also interesting is, the Vedas sight Dyauspitr as the father of Indra. Who’s considered the King of the gods. One of the most significant, if not the most significant god in Hinduism."
Social Studies,"And Indra is now in, especially in the Vedas, and this is the most spoken about god in the Vedas, Has many of the of the qualities that we now in Greek and Roman traditions associate with Zeus and Jupiter. Indra is a sky god, throws bolts of lightning. Actually eerie similarity with the Nordic god of Thor. Where Nordic people were also Indo-European people. Where Indra he throws a hammer and he defeats these monsters. And all of these things, very similar to Thor."
Social Studies,"So hopefully these… You know when I first learn this, it just kind of made me realize how connected the world is, and it started to make me start to look for patterns where I hadn’t seen them before. And it really shows how these civilizations that seemed very unconnected might have, and probably we do believe emerged and (mumbles) emerged from the same place. Modern philologists and historian believe that this Proto-Indo-European might have been spoken by people in the Caucuses."
Social Studies,"The word Caucasian is referring really to these people from that Caucuses area there, but we don’t know for sure. And we believe that they migrated out. And so when we talk about the Germanic tribes going into Northern Europe. The Celtic tribes going into, I guess you could say North South Central Europe."
Social Studies,"You could talk about the Italic, the Latin tribes, you could talk about the Greek tribes, and you could also talk about the In… you could also talk about Indo-Aryan tribes which eventually would settle into Persia and into Northern India. These we believe are all connected.."
Social Studies,"Some historians would place the origins of Hinduism at 5,000 years into the past. It has elements that may have been practiced in the Indus Valley civilization. You also have significant elements that come from the Vedic Period. In fact, the Vedas, for which the Vedic Period is named really form the root of Hinduism as it is practiced today."
Social Studies,"It is believed that the Vedas come from an Indo-Aryan people that many historians believe came from Central Asia and were related to many of the people who colonized Europe. Now, the other thing that is fascinating about Hinduism, and I really just referred to some of it, it is a combination of many cultures that really merged over thousands of years. And, they merged around the Indian subcontinent."
Social Studies,"As you will see there are many traditions, many cultures, many different ways that one can, and many different ways that people do practice Hinduism. But, there are also core beliefs that we wanna get to the heart of in this video. And, we'll discuss more in future videos. Now, what's also interesting is where the name Hinduism or Hindu comes from, a Hindu being someone who practices Hinduism."
Social Studies,"The name for what we now call the Indus River in Sanskrit was Sindhu, and Sindh is still a region in the Indian subcontinent. The version that the Persians said was Hindus and this got converted to Indus in Latin. So really, Hinduism is the term for the cultural and religious practices of people beyond the Indus River. The India really comes from this same root. Indus is where India comes from, but Indus comes from Hindus, which comes from Sindhu and these are all related to the word Hindu."
Social Studies,"And, you can see that very clearly in the Persian version. Now, as I mentioned, there's many different practices in Hinduism, many different traditions, many different rituals in Hinduism, but I'm going to try to focus in on what could be considered the spiritual core. And, a lot of this comes out of the Vedas. They're a collection of hymns, rituals, but also philosophy."
Social Studies,"And, the subset of the Vedas that are very concerned with the spiritual and the philosophical are known as the Upanishads, which means sitting down or coming near to. Some people say coming near to God, some people say coming near to the actual reality, or coming near to a teacher as in sitting down to get a lesson or to have a dialog. Now, the central idea in Hinduism is the idea of Brahman. And Brahman should not be confused with the god Brahma."
Social Studies,"Brahma is sometimes, you could view, as a aspect of a Brahman, but Brahman is viewed as the true reality of things. It is shapeless, genderless, bodiless, it cannot be described. It can only be experienced. Now, according to Hindu belief we are all part of Brahman. And, what we perceive as our individuality is really, you can consider to be a quasi-illusion. So, this might be one individual right over here and then we might have another individual right over here."
Social Studies,"And, this separateness, the illusion of the reality that we see around us this is referred to as Maya. And, Maya is not just the illusion or the quasi-illusion created by our senses it is even notions like our ego, our identity. And, within that context that inner self, the thing that is even within our, that is even deeper than our sense of identity. This is referred to as Atman."
Social Studies,"And, as you can see they way it's been diagrammed here, the way we've drawn it out Atman is essentially the same thing as Brahman. And, oftentimes you will see it referred to as Atman-Brahman, they're really the same thing but it's really, it's an illusion that there is this separateness of our reality. Now, according to Hindu belief in each life you have this core part of yourself which is Atman, which is part of Brahman."
Social Studies,"And, when you die it doesn't disappear, but it will take on or it will subjugate itself to another reality. So, after death this individual or this perceived individual might take on another identity in another reality. They would perceive it as another life. And, this notion of one life after another, one reality after another is sometimes referred to as transmigration of the soul, sometimes referred to reincarnation, or this notion of Samsara, which is this endless cycle of birth and rebirth."
Social Studies,"It really comes from this notion of same flowing, this thing, this pattern that goes on and on and on. And, according to Hindu belief what that next life is, what that next reality is is based on your actions in this life. Karma, literally is referring to actions, but it's really actions driving consequences not only in this reality but in the next reality. Now, there's another notion of Dharma. Dharma is based on what is the role you should play given the reality, given the life that you are in."
Social Studies,"So, in a very simplified way you could say, ""Well, Dharma is the rightful role, the rightful actions, ""your duty depending on your role, ""depending on your reality."" Karma is how that action translates into consequences which is going to drive what happens in this endless cycle. Now, a core idea of Hinduism is to try to escape from this cycle, to awaken to the true reality, awaken from this quasi-reality."
Social Studies,"And, this is really one of the central ideas of the Upanishads that eventually if you can awaken, so let's say that this is an awakening, this entity, this Atman, this self right over here, this perceived individual has now awoken and can see through, pierces the veil of that Maya. Now, they have rejoined Brahman and they've recognized that Atman and Brahman are the same. And, this freeing from Samsara, from this birth death cycle, this is referred to as Moksha."
Social Studies,"Now, to make this idea a little bit clearer let's look at some quotes from the actual Upanishads. So, this is two versions from the Isha Upanishad and the reason why I like to show it is because it shows that if you're translating from Sanskrit into English or really from any one language into another there's gonna be some room for interpretation but we can see it here. So, this is from the Isha Upanishad which is considered one of most important ones."
Social Studies,"It's a subset, it's a section of the Yajurveda, one of the four early Vedas. And, they write, and this is an English translation, ""The wise man beholds all beings in the self, or the Atman, ""and the self in all beings, for that reason ""he does not hate anyone. ""To the seer all things have verily become the self. ""What delusion, what sorrow can there be for him ""who beholds that oneness?"" This is another version of the same verses from the Isha Upanishad."
Social Studies,"""He who sees all beings in the self and the self ""in all beings he never turns away from it, the self. ""For, he who percieves all beings as the self ""how can there be delusion or grief ""when he sees this oneness everywhere."" So, I might be getting into an argument with someone but deep down if I recognize that both myself and that individual that we are part of this same Brahman that he is me and I am it, or I am he, well then that anger seems a little bit misguided."
Social Studies,"Now, to get a little bit more context on this notion of oneness here's another verse from Chandogya Upanishad, which is also considered one of the significant Upanishads. And, it's part of the Sama Veda. ""As the rivers flowing east and west merge in the sea ""and become one with it, forgetting they were separate ""rivers, so do all creatures lose their separateness ""when they merge at last into pure Being,"" into Brahman."
Social Studies,"""There's nothing that does not come from him."" And, the use of the word him is really an anthropomorphism of this notion that has really no gender or body or form. ""Of everything he is the inmost Self. ""He is the truth, he is the Self supreme. ""You are that Shvetaketu, you are that."" And, this last verse is referring it's in this Chandogya Upanishad it's a conversation between the teacher and his son. And, the son is Shvetaketu, my apologies for pronunciation."
Social Studies,"So, what's he's saying is that these rivers is an analogy for you and I and we might see ourselves as different but at some point we will flow and become one with the ocean. And, he's pointing out to his son, you are not different from that, you are self, you are Ahtman. It is Brahman, it is one and the same.."
Social Studies,"They are often considered to be the three most important gods. In modern-day Hinduism, Shiva and Vishnu have far more followership, I guess you can say, or more people view Shiva or Vishnu as the Supreme Being. There's more temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu than there are too Brahma. Followers of Shiva, those who view him as the Supreme Being, they're called Shaivas. They're following Shaivism, or sometimes referred to as Shivaism."
Social Studies,"Shiva has multiple aspects and as we'll see, many of these gods have multiple aspects and multiple connections, but is often referred to as the Destroyer or the Transformer. Vishnu, as I've mentioned, also has a significant following, a significant chunk of Hindus are Vaishnivas, or followers of Vaishnavism or Vishnuism. And Vishnu is considered the Preserver. Brahma, as I mentioned, does not have as much followership in modern-day Hinduism, but he is considered to be the Creator."
Social Studies,"Now in some narratives, he is the Creator and in other narratives, he has been created by either Shiva or Vishnu. Now Brahma should not be confused with Brahman, that we talked about in previous videos. Brahman is considered the absolute reality. the true nature of things. And Brahma you could view as an aspect of it. It is one God as part of this true nature of things."
Social Studies,"In fact, everything you see on this video, in fact everything you see in reality, all of these gods to a Hindu could be considered as just aspects of the true God or the true reality of Brahman. Now what's interesting in Hinduism is that gods are not viewed to have a strict gender. For example, Vishnu has a female incarnation and there's also groups of Hindus who view God as taking a fundamentally female form. One group are known as the followers of Shaktism."
Social Studies,"To Shaktism, God is female, the supreme goddess and takes many forms. Parvati as you see listed here is referred to the Divine Mother. She's viewed as Shiva's consort or Shiva's wife, but she has other forms like Durga which is used as a stronger, more aggressive form of Parvati, sometimes referred to as Devi or Shakti. Shakti means strength or power and is a warrior goddess. You have Lakshmi who is the wife of Vishnu, who represents or has aspects of wealth and prosperity."
Social Studies,"You have Saraswati who has aspects of knowledge, music and the arts and is viewed as the consort or the wife of Brahma. Now these are some of the principal deities that we have on this top row, but there's also many, many other significant deities. And as we will see, depending on what part of India you're in and which group subsect of Hinduism you meet, they will place different levels of emphasis on different deities and have different traditions and different rituals."
Social Studies,"So Ganesh who is very recognizable because he has an elephant head, he is often referred to as Ganpati. He is viewed as the son of Shiva and Parvati. There's a great story about how he, why he has this elephant head. He is viewed as the god of new beginnings and the remover of obstacles. He has a lot of followership and he is revered in a lot of regions of western India, and that's not the only places, but he is known to be a principal God in some of these regions."
Social Studies,"Durga similarly, that I referred to, in eastern India, especially Bengal, the place where my family comes from, Durga Puja, the Puja for Durga, the rituals for Durga are considered to be a very the important part of the Hindu religion. If you go into the south, for some Hindus, Karthikeya or also known as Murugan, might be a significant deity. That is the god of war. Vishnu is known to have multiple incarnations that are very prominent. The most prominent of which are Rama, Vishnu's seventh incarnation."
Social Studies,"He is the main protagonist in the Ramayan, the famous Hindu epic. You have Krishna, who is Vishnu's eighth incarnation. And he is a significant figure throughout Hinduism, including the Mahabharata and the subset of the Mahabharata, which is the Bhagavad Gita. Now what's really interesting, and I already alluded to it, is you have all of this diversity in Hinduism."
Social Studies,"Someone who worships Shiva, you might see at a superficial level, seems more different in their rituals and their beliefs from someone who worships Vishnu, than say, a Protestant from a Catholic in Christianity or a Sunni from a Shia in Islam."
Social Studies,"And what's fascinating about Hinduism is that you don't see these traditional schisms, you don't see a lot of conflict between the Shaivas or the Vaishnavas, because to Hindus, even though you have this diversity of practice across India or across the Hindu tradition, they're all viewed as aspects of Brahman. They're all viewed as different ways to visualize or to connect with the fundamental reality or the fundamental god."
Social Studies,"And because Hinduism has been able to merge these very diverse practices, these very diverse rituals, and it's believed this emerged because as Hinduism emerged, it took traditions from the Indus valley civilization. It took significant traditions from the Indo-Aryans. It took significant traditions from the Dravidians. Instead of saying, ""Hey our different traditions ""are different religions,"" they merged over thousands of years into one religion."
Social Studies,"And the word for this merging, taking an amalgamation of multiple rituals, multiple ideas, multiple, multiple practices, and turning them into one is known as syncretism. Hinduism is perhaps the best example of syncretism where you have these incredibly diverse practices. The gods that I show here are just a sample of them, but they've been connected through this overarching, very diverse religion called Hinduism. And to a Hindu, they're all ways of connecting with the fundamental Brahman."
Social Studies,"And to remind that, we could just zoom out and we see the connection with Brahman which is viewed as this fundamental reality. Which raises an interesting question. Hinduism is oftentimes cited as a polytheistic religion. Polytheism, you have multiple gods. And clearly, I've cited multiple gods even in this video, and this is a sample of all of the gods in Hinduism."
Social Studies,"But at the same time, they're all perceived by many or most Hindus as to being aspects or ways to connect with the fundamental reality of Brahman who many Hindus would call to be the true fundamental God. And so based on that they would say, ""These are just aspects of the one God."" And so they would argue that it is monotheistic. So I'll let you decide how you view it or if it even matters to put apply a label like monotheism or polytheism to the idea of Hinduism."
Social Studies,"The big picture is, is that you have many gods and many practices and they are diverse across the Hindu world, but they are all viewed as connected to this notion of a Brahman.."
Social Studies,"It was called the Vedic Period because this was the time that we believe the Vedas were written, and we have a whole video on the actual Vedic Period. Now there are four Vedas: Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda. The first of these is the Rigveda. When I say first, it's because it's believed that it was written before the other Vedas, as early as 3,500 years ago. The other three are also pretty old, probably older than 3,000 years old."
Social Studies,"Now these four texts are a combination of rituals, of hymns, of mantras, of songs, and of philosophy. For example Rigveda, Rig you can translate as meaning praise, so it's knowledge of ways to praise, praise the eternal, or praise God. Yajurveda you could view as these prose mantras, knowledge of these prose mantras, is Yajurveda. Samaveda, this is knowledge of songs or hymns. Atharvaveda, you can view these as knowledge of things that you should do in your life."
Social Studies,"Now these four texts can be sub-classified into the type of text that they actually are. So what you see here is the sub-classification of the Vedas that's often referenced, that amongst these texts some of the verses are mantras, hymns, prayers, those are referred to as Samhitas. You have the things that are more rituals, ceremonies, these are Aranyakas."
Social Studies,"And Aranyakas are also things being referred to, things that you have learned, or rituals to do in the forest, maybe at the time when the Vedas were written these were things that people would go meditate and do in the forest. You have the Upanishads, which means to sit close to, or sit near. And if you look at the Upanishads, it really is referring to sitting close, or near a teacher, there's a lot of dialog between student and teacher."
Social Studies,"And the Upanishads, in particular, really form the spiritual core of Hinduism, it really focuses around spiritual philosophy. And amongst these four Vedas, there are 108 Upanishads, and 108 is considered a very auspicious number in Hinduism. Now you also have Brahmanas, which are commentary. Now to be clear, there are verses in the Vedas that can be many of these, that can be Aranyakas and Upanishads, so these things are not mutually exclusive."
Social Studies,"Now in the Hindu tradition, one of the unifying factors are the Vedas and the sub-classifications, or sub-categorizations of the Vedas, these are often viewed as divine revelations. Even though the Vedas themselves, some of the authors refer to themselves as authors, as people who are introspecting on these ideas and writing about them, it is believed by many Hindus that this is divine revelation. And the term for that is Shruti."
Social Studies,"And Shruti can also be translated as what is heard, you could argue what is heard directly from the divine. Now, in comparison to Shruti, you also have this notion of Smriti. Smriti can be translated as what is remembered. And there's a significant number of Smriti texts, some of them that are also held very closely, and meet the threshold of divine scripture for many Hindus. Now the most famous of the Smriti texts are the famous Hindu epics. So this is an image from the Ramayana."
Social Studies,"The Ramayana tells a story of Rama, who is one of Vishnu's incarnations, going to save the Princess Sita from Ravana. The Mahabharata is a story of really a family feud between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. You see here the Pandava princes, the five Pandava princes who are all married to Draupadi, it's an interesting story in the Mahabharata how they did end up being married to one princess. And the most significant part of the Mahabharata, for modern day Hindus, is the Bhagavad Gita."
Social Studies,"It is a subset of the Mahabharata, and the Mahabharata is quite long, it will take you a while to read it, but the Bhagavad Gita is quite short. And the Bhagavad Gita takes place really in the climax of the Mahabharata, when you have the Battle of Kurukshetra, where the Pandavas are fighting their cousins the Kauravas."
Social Studies,"And one of the Pandava brothers, Arjuna, who's really considered the greatest warrior of the brothers, as he takes his chariot into battle, his charioteer ends up being Krishna, also an avatar of Vishnu. And the Bhagavad Gita is really about the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna, and it's all about Krishna reassuring Arjuna not only his role in the universe, but it also becomes a little bit of a layer of the spiritual philosophy discussed in the Upanishads."
Social Studies,"In modern day India, the Bhagavad Gita is probably the scripture that is most cited by modern Hindus. So if you really want to understand the spiritual core of Hinduism, the best place to look are the Upanishads, and you also have the Bhagavad Gita, which even though it's part of the Mahabharata, which is considered Smriti, it is revered, and is often considered to be divinely revealed, by Hindus. Now this isn't a comprehensive listing of all of the scripture that is important to Hindus."
Social Studies,"Obviously you have the Vedas, which are very ancient. Even these epics, their events might have taken place 3,000 years ago, or maybe more; their composition was over 2,000 years ago, they were canonized during the Gupta Empire, but there's many other texts. You have things that are believed written during the Vedic Period, the Vedanta, which relate to things like medicine and astronomy. You have commentaries on things like the Upanishads, things like the Brahama Sutra."
Social Studies,"You have the Puranas, which literally means the old things, and these are a whole collection of old stories, epics, etc. So Hinduism, as I mentioned, it is a very broad religion, it is a very diverse religion and you even see that in the texts. I'll now leave you with a final excerpt from the Bhagavad Gita, and what's interesting about this, as I mentioned, is the parallels that it gives to what we see in the Upanishads, and some of what we looked at on the first video on Brahman and Atman."
Social Studies,"The man who sees me in everything and everything within me will not be lost to me, nor will I ever be lost to him. So this is Krishna talking to Arjana, and Krishna's saying me, you could say God, or the Ultimate Reality. He who is rooted in oneness realizes that I am in every being; wherever he goes, he remains in me. When he sees all being as equal in suffering or in joy because they are like himself, that man has grown perfect in yoga."
Social Studies,"And the term yoga, in modern day, often refers to the type of stretching, and exercising, and body postures that you might even have at your local gym, but it's really a more general term of how do you connect to that Ultimate Reality? And some of what you might learn in a yoga class is one mechanism, leveraging the body, but there's other techniques, through meditation and other things, other forms of yoga that are trying to get the individual to better recognize the illusion, the Maya around them, and get connected to the oneness of the Ultimate Reality.."
Social Studies,"What we do know is that as we approach modern Hinduism over the last several hundred years, it did approach something that was more what you are born into. But we'll look a little bit at the scripture and I'll leave it up to you to decide whether it was more of a social class or if it was a class that you were born into."
Social Studies,"Now the four Varnas that are described in the Vedas and other Hindu scripture, at the top you have the Brahmins who are the priests and the teachers, not to be confused with the god Brahma or the ultimate reality, Brahman. Next you have the Kshatriyas who are the warriors and rulers. And it's interesting that at least in Hindu society the Brahmins were considered higher than the warriors, the rulers, the kings. After that you have the Vaishyas who are the farmers, the merchants."
Social Studies,"And then next the Shudras, the laborers, those who worked in service to the other three classes. Now you also had and have people who are outside of these four different classes."
Social Studies,"Today they refer to themselves as Dalits, which means the oppressed, but sometimes they've been referred to as untouchable, and that's because in traditional Hindu society many of these people weren't even able to enter temples, they were discriminated against, they didn't have access to resources, they weren't even allowed to shake hands or make physical contact with other members of Hindu society. And we'll talk a little bit more about how this may or may not be changing."
Social Studies,"Now to see the basis of the Varna system in scripture I will start with this quote from the Rigveda. Now this is from the Purusha Sukta, and Purusha in the Vedas you can view as this cosmic being, but they anthropomorphize this being, making it seem or making an analogy with a human body."
Social Studies,"""When they divided the Cosmic Being, ""how many portions did they make? ""What do they call his mouth, his arms? ""What do they call his thighs and feet? ""The Brahmin was his mouth, ""of both arms was the Rajanya made."" The Rajanya you could view as the Kshatriyas, the warriors and the kings."
Social Studies,"""His thighs became the Vaishya, ""from his feet the Sudra was produced."" So in the Vedas, and there's some dispute about whether this was originally in the Vedas or about whether it was added later, to have a creation story, but it is making reference to these four Varnas. But here it is not 100% clear whether it's just talking about the various classes of society. You're bound to have some priests and teachers, some warriors and rulers, some farmers, merchants, some laborers."
Social Studies,"Or are they saying something more fundamental? Now we can go to the time of the Mahabharata, when the Mahabharata was written and the subset of the Mahabharata which is the Bhagavad Gita, and they also make reference to this Varna system. So the Bhagavad Gita is the part of the Mahabharata where you have Krishna talking to Arjuna and reassuring him about his role in life, and this is what Krishna tells Arjuna."
Social Studies,"""A Brahman's virtues, born of his nature, are serenity, ""self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, ""honesty, learning, and to know the truth ""of things which be. ""A Kshatriya's pride, born of his nature, ""lives in valor, exuberance, determination, ""resourcefulness, bravery in battle, ""and generosity and noble demeanor as a lord of men. ""A Vaisya's task, born with his nature, ""is to till the ground, tend cattle, venture trade."
Social Studies,"""A Sudra's state, suiting his nature, is service."" Arguably in service to the other three classes. Now once again, it doesn't make strict reference to you are born a Brahmin, if your father was a Brahmin then you have to be a Brahmin, or if your father was a Kshatriya, you will be a Kshatriya."
Social Studies,"It is making reference to this idea of being ""born of his nature."" So you could interpret that as, this is this idea that you have some innate gifts, you have some innate tendencies, and those innate tendencies are going to dictate whether you're going to be a Brahmin, a Kshatriya, a Vaisya, or a Shudra."
Social Studies,"I encourage you as always to look up the primary documents yourself, and especially when you're looking at something that is a translation, this is a translation from Sanskrit to English, how it is translated matters. So try to look up multiple translations and come to your own conclusion."
Social Studies,"Now regardless of whether the ancient Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita is over 2,000 years old, if we're talking about the Vedas and especially if the Purusha Sukta was part of the original Vedas, we're talking about something that's over 3,000 years old, regardless of the original intent of the Varna system, whether it was supposed to be just talking about classes as opposed to a hereditary caste, the reality is is over the last several hundred years in India it did become a caste."
Social Studies,"People whose parents were Brahmins became Brahmins. People whose parents were Kshatriyas became Kshatriyas. And they married amongst themselves, and it did dictate their social status. And so to put all of this in perspective I'm going to give you a quote from really one of India's founding fathers. So this is a picture of B.R. Ambedkar and he was born a Dalit, and faced significant discrimination when he was growing up. He wasn't allowed to sit on chairs or eat next to his fellow students."
Social Studies,"As you can imagine his family wouldn't have had access to nowhere near the resources that other people in the village or in the city would have had access to. They would have been actively discriminated with, they wouldn't have even been able to make physical contact with members of the formal Varna system."
Social Studies,"But despite all of that discrimination he was able to get a significant education and eventually become India's first Law Minister, and not only that, but the principal architect of the Indian Constitution. And this is what he wrote about the caste system. ""Caste is not a physical object like a wall of bricks ""or a line of barbed wire which prevents the Hindus ""from co-mingling and which has therefore to be pulled down."
Social Studies,"""Caste is a notion, it is a state of the mind."" And if you look at modern India or if you talk to modern Hindus, many of them will say hey, we don't take caste seriously. We view this as a part of our past, and a part of our past that we're not necessarily that proud of. But there are still Hindus who do take the caste system seriously, especially if you go into rural areas and villages. Many of the things that B.R."
Social Studies,"Ambedkar faced, this level of discrimination, of Dalits not being able to go a temple, not having access to water resources, this is still happening in India. And in things like inter-marriage the caste system is still taken reasonably seriously by a large portion of the Hindu population. Now here's another quote from B.R. Ambedkar. ""Some men say that they should be satisfied ""with the abolition of untouchability only, ""leaving the caste system alone."
Social Studies,"""The aim of abolition of untouchability alone ""without trying to abolish the inequalities ""inherent in the caste system is a rather low aim.""."
Social Studies,"But after the fall of the Gupta Empire India fragments and you could roughly consider this to be the Indian medieval period. This is what India looks like in the year 1000 where you have multiple Hindu kingdoms. Now as we get into the second millennium of the Common Era, you start to have significant Muslim influence."
Social Studies,"At first in the northwest but as we get into the late 12th and early 13th century you have the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and once again North India is now unified under Muslim rule which will continue for some time under both the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire until the British show up. And then eventually in 1947, India becomes an independent country."
Social Studies,"But as much transformation as there is depicted in this map in terms of various empires and rulers, you also see a transformation in the nature of Hinduism. In other videos we have talked about the Vedas composed over 3,000 years ago in the subset that is focused on the metaphysical, on the spiritual known as the Upanishads."
Social Studies,"And this is an excerpt from the Isha Upanishad which is considered one of the most important that emphasizes this notion of our inner Self, capitalized with an S, atma or atman and how it is of the same substance as this formless, nameless ultimate reality sometimes referred to as Brahman. The Wise man, who realizes all beings as not distinct from his own Self, atman, and his own Self as the Self of all beings, does not, by virtue of that perception, hate anyone."
Social Studies,"What delusion, what sorrow can there be for that wise man who realizes the unity of all existence by perceiving all beings as his own Self? And so you have this very abstract idea, some folks would call it monistic. All is one. Your true self is of the same substance as my true self which is of the same substance and is the same thing as the ultimate reality. But the Vedas also focus on rituals and there are also gods in the Vedas. In particular some of the gods that are mentioned most frequently."
Social Studies,"You have Indra who is the god of lightning and the god of storms also referred to in the Vedas as the king of gods. You have Agni, the god of fire. It come from the same root word as ignite. You have Varuna, the god of water. But a question, how do we bridge that to the gods and the practices of modern Hinduism? As we've talked about in other videos on Hindu deities, most Hindus today view themselves as devotees of Shiva or devotees of Vishnu."
Social Studies,"And even though Vishnu is mentioned in the Vedas, he is by no means the focus. Modern Hindu practice is really focused on devotion to Shiva and/or Vishnu or aspects of them or incarnations of them. For example, Rama or Krishna. How did Hinduism evolve in this way? And the answer is the Bhakti movement. And the word Bhakti can be translated as devotion or devotional love. And it's believed to have come out of South India in the seventh century."
Social Studies,"Some people would call it a reform of Hinduism that up until that point focused on the somewhat arcane rituals of the Vedas. And the Bhakti movement provided an alternate path, a path of devotion Through devotion through a deity one can achieve that moksha. Some people would consider it a reform movement, some people would say it was always there. Some historians think that it might have even been in reaction to Muslim influence where there was this devotion or this surrender to a notion of god."
Social Studies,"Some historians think that it co-developed with Sufi Islam which is all about devotional love for God. But needless to say, as we go through the Indian middle ages, the Bhakti movement gains more and more momentum and it's really the defining movement for Hinduism today. And just to get an appreciation for some Bhakti text here is an excerpt from the Bhagavad Gita which is considered by many modern Hindus to be one of their most central scriptures."
Social Studies,"It was likely written over 2,000 years ago and really came into its final form during the Gupta Empire. But the Gita is considered one of the central Bhakti text. And even though the Gita does focus a lot on notions of realizing the self and the ultimate reality and the importance of meditation, it also makes clear that there's a path to self-realization through love, through devotion. This is Krishna, the eighth incarnation of Vishnu talking to the archer Arjun as he goes into battle."
Social Studies,It's a bit of a repudiation of what at the time in medieval India was becoming a more and more rigid caste structure. I look upon all creatures equally none are less dear to me and none more dear. And it is also very inclusive. It is not saying that one needs to only worship Vishnu or only worship Shiva. Those who worship other gods with faith and devotion also worship me. Not a fixation on being absolutely true to all of the rituals in the Vedas.
Social Studies,"Whatever I am offered in devotion with a pure heart, even if it's a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I accept with joy. With that, I'll leave you with a bhajan, a big part of the Bhakti movement of this notion of devotional love to God is singing. (singing in foreign language)."
Social Studies,"Some historians would place the origins of Hinduism at 5,000 years into the past. It has elements that may have been practiced in the Indus Valley civilization. You also have significant elements that come from the Vedic Period. In fact, the Vedas, for which the Vedic Period is named really form the root of Hinduism as it is practiced today."
Social Studies,"It is believed that the Vedas come from an Indo-Aryan people that many historians believe came from Central Asia and were related to many of the people who colonized Europe. Now, the other thing that is fascinating about Hinduism, and I really just referred to some of it, it is a combination of many cultures that really merged over thousands of years. And, they merged around the Indian subcontinent."
Social Studies,"As you will see there are many traditions, many cultures, many different ways that one can, and many different ways that people do practice Hinduism. But, there are also core beliefs that we wanna get to the heart of in this video. And, we'll discuss more in future videos. Now, what's also interesting is where the name Hinduism or Hindu comes from, a Hindu being someone who practices Hinduism."
Social Studies,"The name for what we now call the Indus River in Sanskrit was Sindhu, and Sindh is still a region in the Indian subcontinent. The version that the Persians said was Hindus and this got converted to Indus in Latin. So really, Hinduism is the term for the cultural and religious practices of people beyond the Indus River. The India really comes from this same root. Indus is where India comes from, but Indus comes from Hindus, which comes from Sindhu and these are all related to the word Hindu."
Social Studies,"And, you can see that very clearly in the Persian version. Now, as I mentioned, there's many different practices in Hinduism, many different traditions, many different rituals in Hinduism, but I'm going to try to focus in on what could be considered the spiritual core. And, a lot of this comes out of the Vedas. They're a collection of hymns, rituals, but also philosophy."
Social Studies,"And, the subset of the Vedas that are very concerned with the spiritual and the philosophical are known as the Upanishads, which means sitting down or coming near to. Some people say coming near to God, some people say coming near to the actual reality, or coming near to a teacher as in sitting down to get a lesson or to have a dialog. Now, the central idea in Hinduism is the idea of Brahman. And Brahman should not be confused with the god Brahma."
Social Studies,"Brahma is sometimes, you could view, as a aspect of a Brahman, but Brahman is viewed as the true reality of things. It is shapeless, genderless, bodiless, it cannot be described. It can only be experienced. Now, according to Hindu belief we are all part of Brahman. And, what we perceive as our individuality is really, you can consider to be a quasi-illusion. So, this might be one individual right over here and then we might have another individual right over here."
Social Studies,"And, this separateness, the illusion of the reality that we see around us this is referred to as Maya. And, Maya is not just the illusion or the quasi-illusion created by our senses it is even notions like our ego, our identity. And, within that context that inner self, the thing that is even within our, that is even deeper than our sense of identity. This is referred to as Atman."
Social Studies,"And, as you can see they way it's been diagrammed here, the way we've drawn it out Atman is essentially the same thing as Brahman. And, oftentimes you will see it referred to as Atman-Brahman, they're really the same thing but it's really, it's an illusion that there is this separateness of our reality. Now, according to Hindu belief in each life you have this core part of yourself which is Atman, which is part of Brahman."
Social Studies,"And, when you die it doesn't disappear, but it will take on or it will subjugate itself to another reality. So, after death this individual or this perceived individual might take on another identity in another reality. They would perceive it as another life. And, this notion of one life after another, one reality after another is sometimes referred to as transmigration of the soul, sometimes referred to reincarnation, or this notion of Samsara, which is this endless cycle of birth and rebirth."
Social Studies,"It really comes from this notion of same flowing, this thing, this pattern that goes on and on and on. And, according to Hindu belief what that next life is, what that next reality is is based on your actions in this life. Karma, literally is referring to actions, but it's really actions driving consequences not only in this reality but in the next reality. Now, there's another notion of Dharma. Dharma is based on what is the role you should play given the reality, given the life that you are in."
Social Studies,"So, in a very simplified way you could say, ""Well, Dharma is the rightful role, the rightful actions, ""your duty depending on your role, ""depending on your reality."" Karma is how that action translates into consequences which is going to drive what happens in this endless cycle. Now, a core idea of Hinduism is to try to escape from this cycle, to awaken to the true reality, awaken from this quasi-reality."
Social Studies,"And, this is really one of the central ideas of the Upanishads that eventually if you can awaken, so let's say that this is an awakening, this entity, this Atman, this self right over here, this perceived individual has now awoken and can see through, pierces the veil of that Maya. Now, they have rejoined Brahman and they've recognized that Atman and Brahman are the same. And, this freeing from Samsara, from this birth death cycle, this is referred to as Moksha."
Social Studies,"Now, to make this idea a little bit clearer let's look at some quotes from the actual Upanishads. So, this is two versions from the Isha Upanishad and the reason why I like to show it is because it shows that if you're translating from Sanskrit into English or really from any one language into another there's gonna be some room for interpretation but we can see it here. So, this is from the Isha Upanishad which is considered one of most important ones."
Social Studies,"It's a subset, it's a section of the Yajurveda, one of the four early Vedas. And, they write, and this is an English translation, ""The wise man beholds all beings in the self, or the Atman, ""and the self in all beings, for that reason ""he does not hate anyone. ""To the seer all things have verily become the self. ""What delusion, what sorrow can there be for him ""who beholds that oneness?"" This is another version of the same verses from the Isha Upanishad."
Social Studies,"""He who sees all beings in the self and the self ""in all beings he never turns away from it, the self. ""For, he who percieves all beings as the self ""how can there be delusion or grief ""when he sees this oneness everywhere."" So, I might be getting into an argument with someone but deep down if I recognize that both myself and that individual that we are part of this same Brahman that he is me and I am it, or I am he, well then that anger seems a little bit misguided."
Social Studies,"Now, to get a little bit more context on this notion of oneness here's another verse from Chandogya Upanishad, which is also considered one of the significant Upanishads. And, it's part of the Sama Veda. ""As the rivers flowing east and west merge in the sea ""and become one with it, forgetting they were separate ""rivers, so do all creatures lose their separateness ""when they merge at last into pure Being,"" into Brahman."
Social Studies,"""There's nothing that does not come from him."" And, the use of the word him is really an anthropomorphism of this notion that has really no gender or body or form. ""Of everything he is the inmost Self. ""He is the truth, he is the Self supreme. ""You are that Shvetaketu, you are that."" And, this last verse is referring it's in this Chandogya Upanishad it's a conversation between the teacher and his son. And, the son is Shvetaketu, my apologies for pronunciation."
Social Studies,"So, what's he's saying is that these rivers is an analogy for you and I and we might see ourselves as different but at some point we will flow and become one with the ocean. And, he's pointing out to his son, you are not different from that, you are self, you are Ahtman. It is Brahman, it is one and the same.."
Social Studies,"But either way, that would've been near the end of the Vedic Period. And the Vedic Period is named after the Vedas, these Hindu scriptures written by those Indo-Aryans who came into India, most historians believe, around 1500 BCE, or maybe before that. Now by the time of Siddhartha's birth, Hinduism was really starting to take shape. Many of the things that we would now recognize as modern day Hindu practice already existed. And he was born into that world."
Social Studies,"Now on this map here you see the major sites of Buddha's life. He's born in Lumbini, modern day southern Napal, he eventually meditates at Bodh Gaya under the Bodh tree where he reaches enlightenment. He does his first preaching at Sarnath, and then he eventually dies at Kushinagar. And to modern Buddhists, these are still considered major pilgrimage sites. So he's born, according to tradition, at Lumbini. His mother is in transit and born along the way at Lumbini."
Social Studies,"His mother dies shortly afterwards, he's raised by his aunt, but his father in some accounts is a king, a chieftain, and he's able to give the young Siddhartha Gautama a very good, a very sheltered life. And this life continues into his 20s, he's able to get married, have a child. But at the age of 29 he's able to leave the compound."
Social Studies,"He's able to see the world as it really is outside of this world that his father has created for him, and he sees old age, he sees sickness, he sees poverty, and this creates a lot of consternation in Siddhartha. He wonders why this is so, why is there this suffering in the world? And so he decides, once again, at age 29, to seek the truth, to try to understand the universe as it is."
Social Studies,"And remember, this is in India where it was common practice for religious ascetics to go off into the woods and to meditate about the true nature of reality, try to obtain moksha. So he goes and follows that same practice. And for six years, he is going through the woods, he's wandering, he's left all of his possessions behind, he has left his family behind."
Social Studies,"He famously starts off trying to go in the mold of these Hindu ascetics, letting go of everything, including trying to deprive the body of food and water, and he almost kills himself. But then eventually, at age 35, he makes his way to the town of Gaya, now known as Bodh Gaya. And over there he meditates under a sacred fig tree, later known as the Bodhi tree. And he meditates there for seven days. And on the seventh day, it strikes him, he has a revelation, he awakens, so to speak."
Social Studies,"And according to Buddhist tradition, from that moment he becomes the Buddha, or the awakened one. And for the next 49 days he makes no contact with anyone, but he eventually makes his way to Sarnath. And at a deer park there he re-encounters five of his previous followers and they had given up on him. But now they see that there's a change in Siddhartha, now the Buddha. And he begins to explain to them what he has seen, what he has discovered."
Social Studies,"This is a quotation from the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, what is was called in the Pali language, which was the language of Buddha's time. And it can be translated as Setting the Wheel of Dhamma, which is another word for Dharma, the (mumbles) word Dharma, in motion. And Dhamma in Hinduism means this cosmological law. What you should follow in your life. Dhamma in Buddhism, or Dharma in Buddhism can mean that, but it can also mean the teachings of Buddha and the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta."
Social Studies,"The sayings of Buddha at Sarnath are considered to be his first teachings to his followers. ""There are these two extremes that are not to be ""indulged in by one who has gone forth. ""Which two? ""That which is devoted to sensual pleasure with ""reference to sensual objects: base, vulgar, common, ""ignoble, unprofitable; and that which is devoted ""to self affliction: painful, ignoble, unprofitable."
Social Studies,"""Avoiding both of these extremes, the middle way ""leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, ""to Unbinding."" So this is considered to be Buddha's first reference to the notion of the middle way. And what's interesting here, he's saying things that are consistent with many of the Hindu ascetics of the time. That you shouldn't devote yourself to sensual pleasure, with reference to sensual objects, base, vulgar, common, ignoble. But he's also saying that you shouldn't go the other extreme either."
Social Studies,"You shouldn't devote yourself to self-affliction, painful, ignoble, unprofitable. That, too, is not going to lead to the truth. He says, avoid both of these extremes, the middle way. Now in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta he goes on to describe what are known as four noble truths. ""Now this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering,"" or dhukka, ""Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, ""death is suffering: sorrow, lamentation, pain, ""distress, and despair are suffering."
Social Studies,"""Association with the unbeloved is suffering, ""separation from the loved is suffering. ""Not getting what is wanted is suffering."" So the first noble truth, he's describing this notion of dhukka, this notion of suffering. And later on he goes to expand on it. Saying it's not just traditional notions of sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, but it's also trying to desire or pursue anything that is temporary in nature will eventually lead to dhukka, or suffering."
Social Studies,"""And this, monks, is the noble truth of the origination ""of suffering, the craving that makes for further ""becoming -- accompanied by passion and delight, ""relishing now here, and now there -- craving for ""sensual pleasure, craving for becoming, ""craving for non-becoming."" So that cause of the suffering is this craving. Craving for these impermanent things."
Social Studies,"""And this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation ""of suffering: the remainderless fading and cessation, ""renunciation, relinquishment, release, ""and letting go of that very craving."" So here he's saying, ""Look, you don't have to suffer, ""there's a way to escape from it."" And it's essentially to stop that craving. That's the third noble truth."
Social Studies,"""And this, monks, is the noble truth of the way of ""practice leading to the cessation of suffering."" So, how do you actually practice life in way that you can seize this suffering? ""Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path,"" which is another concept which is quoted a lot in Buddhism, this notion of these eight things that you need to do in order to escape from this suffering, from this dhukka, from this craving."
Social Studies,"""Right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, ""right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, ""and right concentration."" This comes from the Dhammapada, which you can interpret as the path to dhamma. And Buddha says, ""All that we are is the result of ""what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, ""it is made up of our thoughts."" Which is a core idea in Buddhism. That this notion of separateness, this is just due to our thoughts, it's all happening in our mind."
Social Studies,"The psychical reality that you think is somehow more permanent than the transient thoughts, it's all happening in your thought, it's all happening in your mind and the separateness is really an illusion. And once again, very similar idea to what we see in the Upanishads. Now one final idea, Buddha taught throughout his life, and eventually dies at Kushinagar, which is one of those four pilgrimage sites that we saw on that map."
Social Studies,"But really accelerated the spread of Buddhism, especially beyond India, was the reign of the emperor Ashoka during the Maurya Empire. And we talk about Ashoka, we have a whole video on him, but he eventually converts to Buddhism and he sponsors it, he builds temples, and he sponsors missionaries to spread Buddhism from Europe all the way to China. And so Buddha was obviously the central figure, but Ashoka was the accelerant that spread Buddhism to the world.."
Social Studies,"So in both belief systems, there's this notion that the reality that we are in is a quasi illusion. In the Upanishads it's described as Maya. That there's a true self. That there's this atman, which is of the same substance as the true nature of reality, of Brahman. That all things are actually connected. This notion of the individual is just an illusion and it's illusion given to us by this Maya."
Social Studies,"And the Maya isn't just our sensory perception, it's even our notions of ego and possibly even time-space and causality. In Buddhism, there is a parallel notion. That all of what we consider to be reality is just happening in our mind. There isn't anything more real than that. And we are subject to this reality because of our constant craving for that which is impermanent. This craving is called Trishna, which is the Sanskrit word, or Tanha, which is the Pali word, the language of Buddha."
Social Studies,"Now because of this craving, it leads to this constant suffering, this Dhukka, which is really this reality that we are subjecting ourselves to. Now in either case, we take action and that action leads to consequences. And so in both traditions, we have this notion of Karma. And that the Karma, the actions with consequences, lead to further actions and consequences, not just in this life, but in future realities, in whatever next Maya or reality or life that we take on."
Social Studies,"And this constant cycle of birth and rebirth is referred to as Samsara in both of the traditions. So you see this commonality. Now, in Hinduism there's this idea of trying to escape from Samsara through meditation, by being able to see through the Maya and merge your atman with Brahman, seeing that all are one. In Buddhism, there is a similar idea. Through meditation, through following the eightfold path, by recognizing the Four Noble Truths you should escape from this craving of impermanent things."
Social Studies,"And in either tradition as you do that, you escape from the Samsara. And when you escape from the Samsara and this cycle of Karma leading to more and more and the Maya and the Dhukka disappear, in Hinduism the term is Moksha, you have freed yourself from this cycle. In Buddhism, the Sanskrit word is actually Nirvana, which literally means blown out, but it's merging with the emptiness."
Social Studies,"So even though officially, a Hindu might say, through the Moksha your atman is merging with the ultimate reality of Brahman, while in Buddhism, when you achieve Nirvana, you have recognized your nonself and it has merged with the emptiness, with the non-being. Now there is debate. Is Buddhism saying that you should try to achieve a state of non-existence? Many people would disagree. They would say Nirvana is actually the ultimate bliss, to recognize your nonself."
Social Studies,"Some would say, hey this is just a matter of what words you use. In either case, you are recognizing that there isn't the individual, that you are merging with the true reality. That you are merging with the universe, whether you consider the universe to be Brahman or whether you consider the universe to be emptiness. But in either tradition, this is viewed as a state of release, as a state of ultimate bliss and something that you should try to get to through practice.."
Social Studies,"Maybe you're viewing some of the other videos on Buddhism and Hinduism or doing some research yourself. Well let's remind ourselves of the context. Buddha emerges in northeast India in modern day Nepal at the end of the Vedic period. Hinduism has been evolving now for many hundreds of years, arguably close to 1,000 years. Now as we've talked about in other videos, there's a spiritual core of Hinduism described in the Upanishads, this idea of Atman, your inner self."
Social Studies,"Brahman, the ultimate reality that we live in an illusion of Maya and through meditation we should be able to pierce that veil and eventually break free from the cycle of birth and rebirth, Samsara, and become one with Brahmin, become one with the ultimate reality. But in the time of Buddha there were other aspects of Hinduism that were maybe even more associated with the religion."
Social Studies,"There is also a lot of ritual in the Vedas, and in the time of Buddha the Hinduism that he grows up in is very focused on the ritual aspects of it. And it was a Hinduism in which not just anyone could do the rituals, it was a fairly stratified society that he grew up in. We discussed the caste system in some detail. It's still a matter of debate to what degree caste is hereditary in it's actually part of the religion, but it was a fact of the culture of the time."
Social Studies,"Where at the top you had the Brahmins who were the priests and much of their power came from their ability to interpret the Vedas. Came from their exclusive ability to practice the rituals just right. Buddha came from a ruling class, he came from the Kshatriyas class, but even they were considered one notch below the Brahmins and especially the bottom rungs of the caste system these were fairly marginalized people."
Social Studies,"And so when Buddha emerges, initially in a very privileged life he's essentially a prince but eventually when Buddha sees the suffering in the world, a lot of the suffering happening in these lower rungs of society, he looks for answers, spiritual answers, and is not satisfied by what he sees. He's not satisfied by the answers that he's getting from this ruling class."
Social Studies,"You could imagine that he's even suspicious of it, whether they're focused on the true spiritual core, or whether they're focused on ritual as a way to keep their power. But there's also another tradition in Hinduism at the time. This is all very important to why Buddhism was able to emerge when it happened."
Social Studies,"There was this tradition of asceticism, of people going off into the woods and meditating and thinking about the nature of life and these folks were much more focused on this spiritual core and so Buddha initially takes that track. He goes and he meditates and he eventually comes to a realization, he awakens so to speak at the root of Buddhism is that there should not be this stratified society. That one should not focus on ritual."
Social Studies,"That at the end of the day, you need to have a very personal path to Nirvana, to escaping the cycle of Samsara. So I would argue, if I were to simply answer the question why did Buddhism emerge when and where it did? Well if you consider Buddhism to be a reformation of Hinduism, it's important that Buddha was Hindu. It's also important that it needed to be reformed or at least Buddha thought it needed to be reformed. So it's important that at the time that he lived, Hinduism had become very ritualistic."
Social Studies,"It had become very stratified, and he saw a need to reform it. Now there's even a further question. It emerged when it did and we have some ideas of why that might have happened, but why did it become a major religion? One argument was that what he was describing was just very compelling. You no longer have to go through this ruling class, through the priests anymore. You could have your own personal path."
Social Studies,"It was also perhaps compelling to people who felt marginalized in the traditional hierarchy of the time. Another argument would be the emperor Ashoka who we study in other videos, that once he converts to Buddhism after feeling guilty for his war with Kalinga where tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people are killed, he converts to Buddhism and becomes a major patron of Buddhism and sends missionaries throughout the world to spread it."
Social Studies,So one argument of why Buddhism spread is that a few hundred years after Buddha you have a significant powerful emperor converting to the religion and deciding to spread it. Now that leads us to a second question. Are there other historical parallels to what we have just described? And this is something that once again you should always ask yourself in history.
Social Studies,"And what's the structure of this? Well there's some spiritual core here, but eventually you have the ritualistic side as it actually gets practiced. And you have a stratified society where you have a class that has a bit of a monopoly on the ritual derives a lot of their power from that ritual. And then someone comes along and says wait, this priesthood is more focused on power and on ritual than the true spiritual core, and they're not happy with the answers that that priesthood is delivering."
Social Studies,"Can you think of any other parallels to that? Well a few come to my mind, and once again these could all be debated and that's the fun thing about history. I encourage you to debate all of these things. About 500 years after the time of Buddha, someone by the name of Jesus of Nazareth comes onto the scene. Where is the parallel? Well you have the spiritual core of Judaism that comes from Abraham and Moses, but then you have the ritual of the Pharisees of the time. They are the power brokers."
Social Studies,"He feels that the religion is corrupted. He sees the money changers in the temple, and much of his preaching is a reformation, a reminder of that spiritual core. He also tries to encourage people to have a more personal connection and tries to break up the stratification and once again, you could imagine this to be a very compelling message for those who felt marginalized and the parallel goes even further."
Social Studies,"Just as Buddha had Ashoka come onto the scene a few hundred years after Buddha to really popularize the religion, Jesus has a parallel. Roughly 300 years after the life of Jesus, Constantine is emperor of the Romans."
Social Studies,"The same Romans who have been persecuting Christians for 300 years, and all of the sudden Constantine not only allows it to be legal, but he eventually promotes the religion and converts to the religion and it eventually, after Constantine's death, becomes the official religion of Rome whether you're talking about Buddha or Jesus you have a reformer and then a few hundred years later you have a powerful emperor who adopts the religion and spreads it."
Social Studies,"What are other examples? Well even within the world of Christianity we can fast forward another 1,500 years from the time of Jesus and go to the time of Martin Luther. Who at least from his perspective sees the Christian church in the early 16th Century and thinks that it has diverged from the spiritual core, from the teachings of Jesus that it has become too focused on ritual, that the priesthood and the papacy is really more about power than it is about spirituality."
Social Studies,"So he brings about what will be known as a Protestant Reformation which is making the religion more personal, not have to go through a priest, having a personal connection with the spiritual core of religion. After this video think about other historical parallels."
Social Studies,"Are there other religions? What about Islam? What about Sikhism? How do they connect to these ideas or how do they not connect to these? Maybe they're counter-examples, and maybe there are parallels in history that have nothing to do with religion. Maybe it's more about politics or science or economics. Think about these questions.."
Social Studies,"So first on the commonalities. Now both of these schools of Buddhist thought or Buddhist tradition believe in this notion of the cycle of birth and rebirth from one life or one reality to the next, that we call samsara which is also shared with the core of Hindu philosophy. And this idea that your goal should be to realize that all is thought, to escape from the dukkha and eventually obtain nirvana."
Social Studies,"Now the difference between the two schools of thought, in Theravada buddhism, it is much closer to some of the original practices or teachings that we see with Siddhartha Gautama Buddha. It is a very personal journey that is all about the individual though meditation, perhaps with some help from some teacher recognizing the non-self, recognizing that we are all one, and eventually, either in this life or in future lives, achieving nirvana."
Social Studies,"Now Mahayana Buddhism actually encompasses a very large set of various practices but the general idea is that you might have help as you try to achieve nirvana. Someone who achieves nirvana is known as an arhat, so you could Therevada Buddhism as, hey try to go on this personal journey to become an arhat, to achieve nirvana. But in Mahayana Buddhism, the pursuit is not necessarily to get to nirvana as quickly as possible."
Social Studies,"It's to get close to nirvana but then to help others try to achieve that same state So the real goal is to be a bodhisattva, bodhisattva. Now the word bodhisattva is used in both traditions. In Theravada Buddhism, it refers to someone who is trying to become an arhat. Someone who is on the path to achieving nirvana. In Mahayana Buddhism, it is someone who has almost achieved nirvana but holds that off in order to help the rest of the sentient reality."
Social Studies,"The rest of sentient beings eventually achieve nirvana and if you aren't one of the bodhisattvas, you have that help not only from bodhisattvas but there's a fairly large grouping of celestial beings that are there to help. That are there to help focus your meditation and your energy. And what you see here is a depiction that's not atypical from a Mahayana Buddhist shrine."
Social Studies,"In the middle here, you have Amitabha Buddha and a significant chunk of Mahayana Buddhists believe in Amitabha Buddha and you could view him as someone who's revered or is almost a deity-like figure. And this idea that by visualizing, by focusing, by invoking Amitabha Buddha, that you can get to his pure land of bliss known as Sukhavati. And so it's this idea of almost a kind of salvation."
Social Studies,"That by focusing on Amitabha, you get to this pure land of bliss which is a place where it is easier to achieve nirvana from and you can almost view it as something of a heaven. Now what's interesting is Amitabha Buddha isn't exactly the same figure as Siddhartha Gautama Buddha. in some traditions, Siddhartha Gautama Buddha is a projection of Amitabha into our reality."
Social Studies,"And in some Mahayana belief systems there are multiple realities, each with their own Buddha and you can be born and reborn into these different realities and the pure land, the pure land of bliss, the Sukhavati is where you might want to go if you are following, if you are practicing this belief in Amitabha Buddha. So at a very high level, Theravada buddhism is all about this personal journey."
Social Studies,"Trying to follow the practice of Siddhartha Gautama Buddha through meditation, through recognizing the four noble truths, by following the middle way, getting eventually in this life and in future lives to nirvana, becoming an arhat. Mahayana buddhism has a more complex pantheon of celestial beings and deities and can be diverse form one part of the world to another. Eventually the goal is for all sentient beings to achieve nirvana."
Social Studies,"But your individual goal can be better described as delaying nirvana, become a bodhisattva, and assisting all other sentient beings in achieving that nirvana. These are actually the attendant bodhisattvas on the left and the right of Amitabha Buddha. But you don't have just the help of the bodhisattvas, there's also celestial beings, things that you can focus on, things that you can invoke to eventually help you get you to that nirvana."
Social Studies,"Now in order to see where it is practiced, we have this map right over here. First of all, most of buddhism is practiced in the far east of asia or southeast asia. And you see the various schools of buddhism. So in red here, you have the Therevada, the school of the elder monks. In yellow here, you have Mahayana, the great vehicle. And in orange, you have Vajrayana."
Social Studies,"A significant chunk of Vajrayana Buddhists are often referred to as Tibetan Buddhists and they're sometimes grouped with the Mahayana, it's closer to Mahayana. There's this notion of boddhisatvas. There are celestial beings. There are more rituals. Now in terms of population, the country with the largest Buddhist population is China, roughly 250 million Buddhists of the 500 million Buddhists that there are in the world."
Social Studies,"But despite the fact that there are so many Buddhists in China, it is still only 18% of the entire Chinese population. In places like Burma and Thailand, you have a much higher percentage of the population that is actually Buddhist and these regions of southeast asia, most of the population is Buddhist. Now one other really interesting thing about this map is we talk about buddhism starting in northeast India, in southern Nepal. That's where Siddhartha Gautama Buddha lived."
Social Studies,"That's where he spread his teachings. And not only is that where it originated, you have Ashoka who really catalyzed the spread of buddhism and once again that was out of India. But when you look at this demographic map of where you have significant Buddhist groupings, you don't see a lot in India. You see a lot in Sri Lanka. And that's actually where the Theravada tradition comes primarily from. And there's a couple of interesting explanations as to why you don't see it in India."
Social Studies,"One possible explanation is that it was so close to many versions on Hindu practices and we talk about Hinduism being this very diverse and open religion. And it really just got reabsorbed, reassimilated as part of the diverse Hindu tradition. In fact, many Hindus view Buddha as another incarnation of Vishnu.."
Social Studies,"This is today what is Pakistan. Over here, we've got this region that is known as Gandara which is actually we think what the name Kandahar in Afghanistan comes from today. What we've got here is this intersection between two empires. We've got the Seleucid Empire over here in orange. These are, remember the remnants, this is one of three remnants of the empire of Alexander the Great. His general, Seleucus, took this part of Asia Minor, stretching into Central Asia."
Social Studies,"This is the extent of that empire around 280 BCE. What happens in 250 BCE is that a satrapy of the Seleucid Empire called Bactria secedes. It fights a war of independence to establish itself as its own kingdom. This is what we call the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. This is around 250 BCE. It names itself Bactria, after the great city of Bactra which gives it name to Afghanistan's Balkh province and up here on the northeast, you can see the city of Fergana which is today in Uzbekistan."
Social Studies,"If you remember from the article about the Silk Road, this is the very same Fergana where the Han Chinese first encountered those heavenly horses that sweated blood. What I wanna talk about is the culture of this purple region of Greco-Bactria because for many hundreds of years, this region had been passed back and forth between Indian powers and Macedonian powers. It has Hellenic influences and it also has Indian influences. That means we're gonna be talking about something called cultural syncretism."
Social Studies,"Let me put that down right here in the middle of China. Cultural syncretism. What syncretism is is a mixing of cultural objects. That's really it. It's the mixture of cultures and ideas and faiths. Follow me over here because I am interested in talking about the influence that Greek culture had on Buddhism and vice versa. These are two representations of the Buddha from around the same time, and in fact, from around the same region, the region of Gandara near modern-day Kandahar."
Social Studies,"So, within the kingdom of Bactria that we saw. Sandwiched between Hellenic influences and Indian influences. Both of these works are from the 1st Century CE. But let's talk about this footprint because this was a pretty common way to depict the Buddha prior to the 1st Century CE. We see, this is what's called an aniconic representation. This represent a footprint of the Buddha. You can see here some of the themes of Hinduism and Buddhism, so we've got this dharmachakra wheel in the center of the sole."
Social Studies,"We've got triratnas near the heel. We've got, as you can see them very faintly, little swastikas near the metatarsals yonder. And these are all Buddhist or Hindu symbols that approach depicting the Buddha but do not actually put the Buddha into any kind of human physical representation. It's more about what the Buddha has left behind so that human beings can follow in his footsteps. But around the same time in the same region we see this. This is a statue. This is the standing Gandara Buddha."
Social Studies,This again dates from the 1st Century CE from the same region of Bactria. But you can see this is the Buddha wearing Greek clothing. This is a Greek chiton and that's a himation. These are forms of Greek dress and the Buddha is being depicted in a Greek style. This is very similar to the other sculpture that we're seeing coming out of Hellenistic cultures at the same time.
Social Studies,"And so what we see when we see this Gandara Buddha, the standing Buddha, we have the combination of Buddhist faith or Buddhist philosophy combining with Greek cultural aesthetics. Indeed, Buddhism was practiced in this region for many hundreds of years."
Social Studies,"Since if you recall, let's go back to the map, because you're recall that Fergana and Bactria and all of these cities throughout Central Asia, Kandahar is back down here, are on the Silk Road that connect the world of what's called as the west shore to China. Through Fergana and through Bactria, you could get to the great centers of India. You can get to Pataliputra and Suvarnagiri and have access to the sea routes of trade."
Social Studies,"Many historians believed that it is through the cities of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom that Buddhism made its way along the Silk Road to the various oasis cities of Central Asia, and from then on, into China. We see syncretism whenever cultures combine with one another. And it is said that when Alexander the Great came to the head waters of the Indus River Valley, remember this is in upper Pakistan, he brought many philosophers with him to meet with the great thinkers of the Hindu ascetic tradition."
Social Studies,"These, the Greeks called the Gymnosophists, which means the naked thinkers because these men were so devoted to the practice of philosophy that they fasted and they wore either no or very little clothing because they felt that it got in the way of their pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. And if you make a study of Greek philosophy, you will see the impact that these Indian thinkers had on Greek philosophy during this period as well. Let's talk about some other examples of syncretism."
Social Studies,"This right here is the Nestorian Stele or rather this is a rubbing of the Nestorian Stele. This is a giant limestone block that was erected in 781 in Chang'an, the imperial capital of the Tang Empire in China. Celebrating 150 years of Nestorian Christianity. If you look very closely, you can see this little cross up here. There you go. There's your Nestorian cross, see right there. You can see all these Chinese text that symbolizes the important connection of the Church of the East to Tang China."
Social Studies,"What's interesting about this stone monument is the way in which Christianity is described within it. In order to proselytize to a Chinese population, Nestorian Christianity adapted its approach to suit the mores of the people that lived there. In this text, Christ is described in Daoist and Buddhist terms. Let me read you a little bit of the translation. ""A virgin gave birth to the holy one in Syria."
Social Studies,"""A bright star announced the felicitous event ""and Persians observing the splendor ""came to present tribute. ""The ancient dispensation is declared ""by the 24 holy men was then fulfilled. ""And he laid down great principles ""for the government and families and kingdoms."" They're talking about the messiah here. ""He established the new religion of the ""silent operation of the pure spirit of the Triune. ""He rendered virtue subservient to direct faith."
Social Studies,"""He fixed the extent of the eight boundaries."" Now, we're getting into some concepts from Mahayana Buddhism. ""Thus completing the truth and freeing it from dross. ""He opened the gate of the three constant principles."" Again, these are Buddhist concepts. The impermanence, suffering, and non-self. ""Introducing life and destroying death. ""He suspended the bright sun to invade ""the chambers of darkness, ""and the falsehood of the devil were thereupon defeated."
Social Studies,"""He set in motion the vessel of mercy ""by which to ascend to the bright mansions. ""Whereupon rational beings were then released, ""having thus completed the manifestation of his power, ""in clear day he ascended to his true station."" You can see the way that Buddhist thought is being used to contextualize Christianity, and really, that's what syncretism is all about."
Social Studies,"It's about taking a new idea, this thing, and putting it in line with this stuff, the eight boundaries, the constant principles, freeing the truth from dross. What these Nestorian missionaries were attempting to do was take these Christian principles and recast them Buddhist or Daoist light. Taking something and recasting it to fit the context of a new situation. You can learn anything. David out.."
Social Studies,"That can make their differences a lot more salient and give us a better idea. Of course, it's hard to know the history of women back then in general. We don't necessarily have all the best sources. But we can try to piece together some understanding of what their daily lives were like. - [Sal] We have two points of reference here; one from Rome as it transitions from republic to empire; and another from Han China. Let's look at the reference from Rome."
Social Studies,"Just for a little bit of context, this speech that we're gonna talk about, this occurs in 42 BCE. People might remember that in 44 BCE you have Julius Caesar getting assassinated on the Ides of March, and it throws the Roman Empire into a civil war. And so, this speech is given during that civil war. Because civil wars, they're not just bloody, they're also expensive, and to fund that civil war the triumvirs decide to tax the 1400 wealthiest women."
Social Studies,"Hortensia, who gives this speech, is one of those wealthy women. - [Eman] Hortensia says: ""Why should we pay taxes ""when we do not share in the offices, honors, ""military commands, nor, in short, the government, ""for which you fight between yourselves ""with such harmful results? ""You say 'because it is wartime.' ""When has there not been war? ""and when have women paid taxes? ""By nature of their sex women are absolved ""from paying taxes among all mankind."
Social Studies,"""Our mothers did once rise superior to their sex ""and made contributions when you faced the loss ""of the empire and the city itself ""through the conflict with the Carthaginians. ""But they funded their contributions voluntarily ""from their jewelry not from their landed property, ""their fields, their dowries, or their houses, ""without which it is impossible for free women to live... ""Let war with the Celts or Parthians come, ""we will not be inferior to our mothers ""when it is a question of common safety."
Social Studies,"""But for civil wars, may we never contribute ""nor aid you against each other. ""We did not pay taxes to Caesar or to Pompey, ""nor did Marius ask us for contributions, ""nor Cinna, nor Sulla, ""even though he was a tyrant over this country. ""And you say that you are reestablishing the Republic!"" - [Sal] Wow, that was quite powerful. And there's a lot of richness here. What's your takeaway? - [Eman] So, it's interesting that she is saying that by nature of their sex women are absolved from paying taxes."
Social Studies,"It might seem like she's saying that women are weaker; but she's sort of speaking back to this requirement that they should use their property. Because they're normally using jewelry and they're normally using things that they don't necessarily need in order to fight off foreigners. Here she's really taking issue with having to use her livelihood to support a civil war, and she's sort of taking them to task on this, that they're worse than tyrants for asking this of her."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] The other thing that jumps out of this, it comes outta the first few statements, ""Why should we pay taxes when we do not share ""in the offices, honors, military commands, ""nor, in short, the government."" She's making very clear, women don't get to participate. Why should we fund this war? I also like this part."
Social Studies,"""You say 'because it is wartime.' ""When has there not been war?"" That's a really good point, because Rome, especially at that point, was continuously conquering other peoples, continuously at war, sometimes a civil war, sometimes an external war. - [Eman] Sure, and I think it's interesting how she's pointing to that disparity between the things that men have and women don't have."
Social Studies,"And she's just trying to say: ""Well, if that's how it's ""going to be, then we should also be exempt from taxation."" I think that's an interesting way to voice concerns. While this might seem very primitive to our modern sensibilities, it's really powerful that a woman is taking these government officials to task and being so outspoken and quite scathing in the way she does this. - [Sal] I also like the second part right over here, where she is citing that our mothers once also stepped up."
Social Studies,"She's referring to, during the Second Punic War and Hannibal was running amuck on the Italian Peninsula and even threatening Rome itself, that the women of Rome, especially the wealthy women of Rome, did step up and pay taxes. - [Eman] So, based on this, Sal, what do you think we can learn about Roman women and their lives at this time period? - [Sal] Well, as we pointed out, even in this speech she cites some direct reference to not having equality to men."
Social Studies,"But on the other hand, she has stormed the triumvirs' tribunal. I think this is the first time that women were, they weren't even allowed there, they just went there, and she's sticking it to the triumvirs pretty strongly. She's saying: ""Let war with the Celts or Parthians come, ""we will not be inferior to our mothers."" ""We're willing to step up if it's war with external parties."
Social Studies,"""But for civil wars, may we never contribute ""nor aid you against each other."" They're saying: ""Hey, if you wanna fight yourself, ""that's your problem."" And she's even telling 'em: ""And you say ""that you are reestablishing the Republic!"" She's questioning the three most powerful people in the Roman Empire. She's questioning their very intention."
Social Studies,"So it does show, at least culturally, even if officially women do not have a strong role, at least these elite women do have enough comfort to be able to go to the three most powerful in the Roman Empire and stick it to them. - [Eman] Yeah, and while this may not seem like a big deal to us now, we have to avoid that comparison, like I said. If we compare it to some other societies around the same time, this is quite remarkable for a woman to enter a public institution."
Social Studies,"Again, she is an elite woman, but let's compare it to, say, Athenian women, even elite woman in Athens, were not likely to have any involvement in the political institutions, were a lot more likely to just remain in the private sphere, were not likely to be as educated as Roman women."
Social Studies,"And so, the fact that Hortensia can actually enter into the space and be so outspoken is sort of evidence of the fact that Roman women had a degree more freedom than other women who were their contemporaries in other societies. - [Sal] Absolutely. Let's continue that comparison. We can go about 100, 150 years further in the future from Hortensia's speech. Let's also go to the other side of, almost the other side of the world, we'll go to eastern Asia, where we are in the Eastern Han Dynasty."
Social Studies,"So here we have some text from Ban Zhao, who was a female historian, astronomer, mathematician, Confucian, philosopher, coauthor of the official history book of Han. It's from her Lessons for Women. - [Eman] So, Ban Zhao says: ""Let a woman modestly yield to others; ""let her respect others; let her put others first."
Social Studies,"""Herself, last."" ""Lay the (girl) baby at birth below the bed ""to plainly indicate that she is lowly and weak, ""and should regard it as her primary duty ""to humble herself before others."" ""A husband can marry twice, but his wife must never remarry."
Social Studies,"""Just as Heaven cannot be disobeyed, ""so the wife cannot keep away from her husband."" ""Man is honored for strength; ""a woman is beautiful on account of her gentleness."" - [Sal] So what's your take on that? - [Eman] So, this is very much inline with the Confucian ideal of womanhood, and that's very much about a woman being very submissive to her male relatives, and for her to stay very modest within the power framework of her society, and to stay pretty much within her own household, and to cultivate a life that is meant to create comfort for the men in her family and her children, and not much more than that."
Social Studies,"- [Sal] Yeah, I could not imagine anyone who read this and took it seriously as doing a lesson for themselves and storming the triumvirs' tribunals, even if they are an elite woman in imperial China. - [Eman] Certainly, but I think there's an important thing to remember, and that this kind of document shows a prescriptive approach to women's lives. And that doesn't necessarily mean that women did live this way."
Social Studies,"The fact that Ban Zhao herself is writing this is sort of ironic because she's a woman who is putting herself out there and writing things and not staying in the private sphere, so that's sort of a strange contradiction there. But also, women who had a lot of wealth were likely to become educated like her. And also, it sort of depended on their generation. Older women were likely to have inheritances, property, just like their Roman counterparts, and they were more likely to engage in trade."
Social Studies,"We can find this out by looking at other documents, like wills and so forth. So we can sort of see a tension between the prescriptive Confucian ideals and how women actually lived. In a lot of ways, having wealth allowed women to buy their way out of these constrictive practices and ideas about women. - [Sal] I definitely agree with that irony."
Social Studies,"It's quite thick here, because she's telling other women to indicate that she is lowly and weak, but Ban Zhao herself, as I mentioned, she's a historian, astronomer, mathematician, Confucian, philosopher, she co-wrote one of the official histories of the Han empire, she's more prominent and has done more than the great majority of men in her time, so she's clearly not lowly and weak. So the irony is quite thick. - [Eman] Certainly."
Social Studies,"It's interesting to look at these things because, like you said, it gives us a sense of the difference. There seems to be quite a different culture at play between Rome and China at this time. And so, making that kinda comparison gives us a lot more information about women's lives than simply saying that there's a single history for all women of this time period, and that's simply not the case."
Social Studies,"As we can see, there are huge differences between the civilizations; certainly, even within civilizations there can be huge differences. - [Sal] Yes. Both of the examples we looked at have been very elite women. We're talking about women well within the top 1%. If you went to more average women, their situation would have been very different. - [Eman] Certainly."
Social Studies,"So, this idea that women are supposed to have a nice home full of family and stay within that, only wealthy women could really live up to that; because if you have to leave the house to make a living, you might not be able to create this idyllic household full of children and spend all your time managing that. So that's an important difference, as well. - [Sal] Thanks, Eman. This was really valuable. - [Eman] Thanks, Sal.."
Social Studies,"Now, the reason why I'm doing it is because religion is such a big part of our modern culture, it's clearly, especially the Old Testament, is the basis of three major world religions today, and so it can help us hopefully create a little bit more of a narrative in our head on some of these ancient events, because a lot of these events described in the Old Testament have a historical context. There was a Babylon, there was a Neo-Babylonian Empire. We're gonna talk about Nebuchadnezzar in this video."
Social Studies,"There were pharaohs, these things are described in the Old Testament. Now, there's other things in the Old Testament that have less of a historical context, where we really don't have evidence yet of did they happen, or did they happen in the way that is described in the Old Testament? We might be able to find that evidence over time."
Social Studies,"And then there's clearly a lot of events that are not described in the Old Testament, but we are able to find evidence, we're able to find documents, writing, hieroglyphs, we're able to find artifacts and date those artifacts, we're able to find ruins."
Social Studies,"And the fun of history is to try to figure out, well, what do we know and what do we not know, and can we construct narratives that make sense? And over time, whether we're talking about events that are referred to in the Old Testament, or things where there's a large historical basis for it, as we understand more, these dots might change a little bit, or at least our understanding of how they occurred or the causality."
Social Studies,"So that's one of the really fun things in history, and I encourage you, everything that you hear me say, don't take it for granted, look it up yourself, and come to your own conclusions. So with that said, let's continue, and I'll review a little bit from the previous video. We're in 1700 B.C.. It's the time of Hammurabi, you have the code of Hammurabi, famous, famous, as a written code, a written code of laws."
Social Studies,"Now, we believe, if the stories of Abraham, because there are parallels between the Old Testament and the code of Hammurabi, it has often placed Abraham, as a biblical figure, is often placed in or shortly after the time of Hammurabi."
Social Studies,"And so it's Abraham of Ur, and this migration to Canaan, which would eventually become the kingdom of Judea and Israel, modern-day where the states of Israel and Palestine are, that migration, people place it at around 1200, or sorry, at around 1700 B.C.E., once again, roughly in the time of Hammurabi. Now, we don't know this. There is not a lot of historical evidence here, but it fits kind of the historical context, especially with the code, with the code of Hammurabi."
Social Studies,"Now, we fast forward a few hundred years, and now we're firmly on the side of religion, where these are stories from the Old Testament. We haven't found a lot of historical evidence yet of the migration of the Jewish people to Egypt, the famous story of Joseph. So that's the migration, which is placed, tends to be placed around 1500 B.C.E.. 1500 B.C.E., and once again, I'm gonna put a question mark here."
Social Studies,"And so when we look at our timeline, this is Abraham going from Mesopotamia and then to what is now, or to establish this tribe in what eventually becomes Judea, Israel."
Social Studies,"They're there for several hundred years, you have the story of Joseph, Abraham's grandson, he becomes a vizier of the pharaoh, his family eventually joins him, but then the Jewish people get enslaved, according to the Old Testament, for several hundred years, until they are freed in the Book of Exodus by Moses, and they are led back to Judea. And so this part right over here, we are definitely, let me circle that in a color you can see."
Social Studies,"This part right over here, we're definitely operating outside of a lot of historical evidence. But we believe that the exodus from Egypt back to Judea, this is often placed around 1200 B.C.E.. So I know my map is getting a little bit... 1200 B.C.E., and once again, I'm gonna put a question mark there, because we don't really know."
Social Studies,"But that's where we believe that the, what was essentially the tribe of Jewish people is now established as a real state, as a real kingdom, the united kingdom of Israel and Judea, and you have the famous kings, King Saul, King David, King Solomon, King Solomon famously noted for the construction of the first temple at Jerusalem. And now we're gonna fast forward, because in a few hundred years, that temple gets destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire. So let's fast forward a little bit."
Social Studies,"The Neo-Babylonian Empire, led by Nebuchadnezzar II, often known as the Chaldean Empire. This is approximately, and I'm going very high level in this video, 600 B.C.E., before the common era, secular way of saying before the time of Christ, before Christ, you might often see B.C., which would refer to before Christ, B.C.E. is referring to before the common era, but 600 B.C.E. and 600 B.C. are referring to the same date."
Social Studies,"But you have the Neo-Babylonian Empire, and I'll stress the word Neo, because even though you hear a lot about Babylon when we talk about ancient Mesopotamia, you notice that Babylon was only dominant for relatively short periods of time when we look at this, you know, multi-thousand year view of things. Actually, most of the time, in this period, the Assyrians were dominant, with their capital at Nineveh. But when we get to roughly 600 B.C.E., you have Nebuchadnezzar II."
Social Studies,"He is the king, the emperor, of this Neo-Babylonian Empire, and he goes... He searches for conquest. He wants to expand his empire. And he's really set on taking over the pharaohs, among other people, or the Egyptians, but on his way, he's unsuccessful on taking over the pharaohs, so let me, this is him on the way to try to take over the pharaohs. He is unsuccessful to try to take over Egypt."
Social Studies,"But on the way, he's able to march through a lot of what we now call the Middle East, and relevant to the Old Testament, he destroys the first temple that Solomon built, so he destroys that temple, and then he takes the Jewish people captive, according to the Old Testament. And that is the famous Babylonian captivity, and that was Nebuchadnezzar who does it. Now, Nebuchadnezzar's empire, his dynasty, is relatively short-lived in the whole scheme of things."
Social Studies,"The Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Chaldean Empire, because by the time we get to the, or we get a little bit further into the sixth century B.C.E., so around 539, 539 B.C.E., this is when you have the Persians come and invade the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The Persians, led by Cyrus the Great."
Social Studies,"So now you have the Persians come and take over the Neo-Babylonian Empire, and on our timeline here, this is the Persians going on, going and taking over more and more territory, they take over Mesopotamia, they're able to take over what we, you know, Judea and actually this whole region that is kind of the modern Middle East, and they are successful. And this is a big deal, because look how long this line of Egyptian civilization is."
Social Studies,"They are able to take over Egypt, and they keep going their conquest, and as we'll see in the next video, they get very frustrated because they're not able to take over the Greeks, even though in a lot of ways, the Greeks did not seem as significant of an empire as the Egyptians or the Babylonians. But we will continue that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"And his successor, Cambyses II, in 525 B.C.E., is able to do something that many of the conquerors that we've talked about in the last two videos were not able to do, and conquers Egypt, and makes that part of the Persian Empire. And so the Persian Empire is this vast and significant empire that gets created in this time period. But they soon run up to a, I guess you could say a group of city-states, a civilization, that is able to fend off the Persians."
Social Studies,"And so just to be clear what we're talking about or what I just talked about, here we are in roughly 539 B.C.E., where you have Cyrus the Great is able to take over the Neo-Babylonian Empire, and in doing so, going back to references from the Old Testament, ends the Babylonian captivity of the Jewish people, is able to free the Jewish people, and then his successor, Cambyses, in 525 B.C.E., is able to take over Egypt."
Social Studies,"And so you see this expansion of the Persian Empire on this timeline as well, but then they run up against the Ancient Greeks. And the Ancient Greeks were not a unified nation. They were a group of city-states. When people talk about city-states, it's cities like Athens that are associated with the Ionians, that settled several hundred years ago in that region, the Spartans, associated with the Dorians, who also moved down several hundred years before the time period we're talking about."
Social Studies,"They each had, each city was its own state, it had its own military, it had its own laws and traditions. But they also had things in common. They shared a language, they shared traditions, they shared religion."
Social Studies,"And the Persians, and I'll do many videos on this, because it is fascinating, were not able to conquer, and now this is under the successors of Cyrus the Great, or the successor of Cyrus the Great and Cambyses, we have Darius the Great, is not able, in multiple attempts, to take over the Greeks, and these are the famous Greco-Persian Wars, which occur from 499 B.C.E. to 450 B.C.E.. Greco-Persian Wars. In our map, we see it right over here."
Social Studies,"The Greco-Persian Wars, and there are some famous instances, famous events, from why we now run a marathon to the movie 300, where you have the stand that the Spartans attempted to take at Thermopoli, where the Persian army, with thousands and thousands of soldiers facing 300 Spartans and several hundred other soldiers, say ""give us your arms,"" and once again, we don't know how much of this is legend and how much is true, but it's a good story, and the Spartans say ""come and take them,"" and then the Persians say ""we have enough arrows to blot out the sun,"" and the Spartans say ""good, then we will fight in the shade."" So the Greco-Persian Wars, they happened, and they're also the stuff of legend and some great stories and great movies even have come out of those wars."
Social Studies,"Now, even though the city-states of Greece were able to fend off the Persians in this time period, they're not able to unify, and in fact they start fighting each other. And that's when you start having the Peloponnesian Wars. So 431, from 431 B.C.E."
Social Studies,"to 404 B.C.E., you have the Peloponnesian, or I should say the Peloponnesian War, and that is between Sparta and its allies and Athens and its allies, and we'll once again do more videos on this, but Sparta is this militaristic society, Athens, famous for its culture and its learning, but they're able to give each other a good fight. Now can you imagine, while they're fighting each other, it leaves them open to be conquered by someone else. And that someone else ends up being Philip of Macedon."
Social Studies,"And the Macedonians are a related people. They share a similar language, they have similar traditions, and Philip of Macedon is able to take over most of what we now consider to be Greece. And as famous as Philip of Macedon is, his son is perhaps one of the top five most famous people in history, because in 336, Philip of Macedon dies, he's actually assassinated, and his son, Alexander the Great, takes over. And his son is only 20 years old."
Social Studies,"And he wasn't called Alexander the Great when it started, but when he was done, they called him Alexander the Great. So Alexander takes over, I'll write this down, he's 20 years old, and he quickly consolidates power, not only over Greece, but he starts establishing an empire, where he's able to take over, now the shoe's on the other foot, he's able to take over much of what was the Persian Empire."
Social Studies,"He actually is able to take his armies all the way to the borders of India, he's taking over Egypt, much of the Middle East. And so this is often referred to as the world's greatest adventure, and it's fascinating because he does this over a little bit more than a decade. He dies in 323, so 323 B.C.E., Alexander dies. So he's in his early 30s, and he managed to do this. Depending on what side of history you're on, fortunately or unfortunately, his empire isn't able to last."
Social Studies,"So you can see this on our timeline. Alexander, in that brief, you know, a little bit more than a decade, he's able to take over all of this territory. He's able to get his armies to the borders of India, but then because he dies, it's short-lived, the empire does not last. It actually gets split into multiple empires. People who are related or the generals of Alexander. We'll do many videos about that split."
Social Studies,"But maybe more interestingly, while that is happening, at the time of Alexander, another group is emerging that will eventually turn into one of the greatest empires that the world has ever seen. And that is the Romans, that we see, or they are the Romans, that we will see in the next video. You can see it on this timeline right over here.."
Social Studies,"But coincident with that time we have other powers in other parts of the Mediterranean that are growing. Mainly the Romans, and Rome was established several hundred years before the time of Alexander the Great, but by that time they're starting to conquer more and more of the Italian peninsula right over here, what we would now consider the Italian peninsula. You also have a power in Carthage forming right over here on the north African coast. Carthage was initially a Phoenician settlement."
Social Studies,"The Phoenicians, famous for our phonetic alphabet. The Phoenicians were based in what is now modern day Lebanon and Syria and they were traders and they settled throughout the Mediterranean. And Carthage and the Carthaginian power or civilization was a fairly significant one at this time."
Social Studies,"And you could imagine when there are two powers that are close to each other, they might want to be going after the same interests or conquest the same land, or they might view each other as a threat, they tend to start fighting each other. And that is true of Rome and Carthage. And the wars that they fought, they were called the Punic Wars, and they occurred between 264 BCE and 146 BCE. You have the Punic Wars, Punic."
Social Studies,"And once again, we will do many videos on the Punic Wars, but these are the wars that involved Hannibal famously taking elephants across the Alps in order to attack Rome. And we see it right over here on our little timeline. The Punic Wars between Carthage and Rome. And just to be clear, this little purple shaded in on our timeline, that represents the Carthage and the Carthaginian civilization. I guess you could say power. And this is Rome."
Social Studies,"But eventually Rome wins decisively and is actually able to wipe out Carthage, literally wipe it out. And so Rome more and more is becoming the dominant power in the Mediterranean, and as you will see shortly, well beyond the Mediterranean. In this period Rome is a republic. And when we talk about a republic, we're talking about some type of representation, although it's not the same form of representation that we would think today. We would be talking some form of preserving rights."
Social Studies,"Once again, not exactly as what we would do today. But as we get to the middle of the first century BCE, we have a very successful Roman general, you might have heard his name, Julius Caesar, who was able to take power of Rome, who was able to be the dictator of Rome. And in power he starts to end the republic, and he does many other things. He starts rearranging the calendar, gets a month named after him, July, and then he gets assassinated and his adopted son Augustus takes power."
Social Studies,"And Augustus is often considered to be the first true emperor of Rome, that the republic is now over. And he, too, gets a month named after him, August. Now at around the same time, you have another very significant figure that shows up, and obviously Jesus is a significant figure in religion, but that has effect on history. His teachings are the basis of a religion that's going to have profound consequences for the rest of history, for the world."
Social Studies,"And even though we might have this, you could say, the secular timeline of BCE, refers to before the common era, or CE, the common era. Right now the year I'm making this video is 2016 CE. Those are secular versions of a calendar which is, essentially, centered on Jesus' birth or pretty close to Jesus' birth. Instead of BC, it would be before Christ. Instead of CE, we say AD, in the year of our Lord in Latin."
Social Studies,"And Jesus, it's important to note, because sometimes people might learn about the life of Jesus and they might think about the holy land and Nazareth and Jerusalem and whatever else, but it's important to realize that at that time, Jesus was born and raised and grew up and died as part of the Roman Empire. In fact, when he was born, which wasn't actually zero BCE, or zero we should just say, year zero, we now think it was pretty close to 4 BCE or 4 BC."
Social Studies,"So he was born in the reign of Augustus and he died in the reign of Tiberius. So some of the first Roman emperors. So with that, we have our overview of especially ancient civilization. And in the next few videos, or many vidoes, we will go deeper and drill deep into each of these topics that we referred to, but hopefully the last few videos give you a high-level view of what was happening in the world both in terms of time and space."
Social Studies,"But as we enter into the fifth century, there is an official split between the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. They're actually governed separately. Now, also in other videos, we talk about the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire. Now, one thing to keep in mind, sometimes when we talk about the fall of the west, it somehow implies that there's no governance left or there's no kingdoms left. And nothing could be further from the truth."
Social Studies,"One of the reasons why the Western Roman Empire fell is repeated attacks by Germanic tribes, and after the Western Roman Empire was gone, the Germanic tribes, for the most part, took over. On the Italian peninsula, you at first have the kingdom of Odoacer, but eventually you have rule, especially as we get into the late fifth century, you have the Ostrogothic Kingdom, Ostrogoths, the Eastern Goths, the Eastern Germanic tribes. Here in North Africa, you have the Vandals, another Germanic tribe."
Social Studies,"Here in the Iberian peninsula, you have the Visigoths, the Western Goths, yet another Germanic tribe. Here you have the Burgundians, you have the Franks. The word France comes from the notion of land of the Franks. Once again, all of these are Germanic kingdoms that took over, where before you had the Western Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"Now, as you can see from this map, and we've talked about it in previous videos, it was only the Western Roman Empire that fell and fragmented and, for the most part, came into the hands of these Germanic tribes. The Eastern Empire continues on, and it's often known as the Byzantine Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Now, what we'll see is that the Byzantine Empire lasts for almost another 1,000 years, but its importance in the region diminishes for most of that period."
Social Studies,"It does have one last hurrah, so to speak, with the reign of Emperor Justinian. Justinian is able to come to power in 527. He comes into power with the help of his uncle, who's the previous Emperor Justin, and Justinian is able to regain much of the land that was lost to the Germanic tribes. Over the course of Justinian's reign, as you can see, they're able to retake the Italian peninsula and much of North Africa."
Social Studies,"Now, things weren't always easy for Justinian, and they are very difficult at the beginning of his rule and they get hard near the end of his rule as well. In 532, there's significant rioting in Constantinople, which is his capital. It all starts around chariot racing and the different groups or gangs that support the different chariot racing teams, but it eventually becomes an all-out revolt against Justinian."
Social Studies,"And many of Justinian's advisors, including Justinian himself, they're afraid that they're gonna be overthrown and killed, and they think about fleeing Constantinople. And this is only five years into his reign. This is in 532. And at that point, his wife Empress Theodora stands up and becomes a very important actor in history. She has her famous speech at the point in time when Justinian and his advisors were thinking about fleeing, fear of death. They thought they were going to be overthrown."
Social Studies,"And here is that famous quote from Empress Theodora. The present occasion is too serious to allow me to follow the convention that a woman should not speak in a man's council. Those whose interests are threatened by extreme danger should think only of the wisest course of action, not of conventions. In my opinion, flight is not the right course, even if it should bring us to safety."
Social Studies,"It is impossible for a person, having been born into this world, not to die, but for one who has reigned, it is intolerable to be a fugitive. May I never be deprived of this purple robe, the purple robe signifying royalty, being an empress, and may I never see the day when those who meet me do not call me empress. If you wish to save yourself, so she's talking to Justinian and Justinian's advisors, if you wish to save yourself, my lord, there is no difficulty. We are rich."
Social Studies,"Over there is the sea, and there are the ships. Yet reflect for a moment whether, when you have once escaped to a place of security, you would not gladly exchange such safety for death. As for me, I agree with the adage that the royal purple is the noblest shroud. So, she's saying I would rather die as an empress than try to be a fugitive and just try to live my life, the rest of my life, somehow comfortably."
Social Studies,"And she's able to convince Justinian, and they're able to put down the uprising quite brutally, killing 30,000 of the people who are rising up against them. Now, during that uprising, much of Constantinople is burned, including the main church, the Hagia Sophia, and it was under Justinian's rule that the Hagia Sophia gets rebuilt. And it still exists in what is now Istanbul today. Constantinople eventually gets renamed Istanbul once it's conquered by the Turks."
Social Studies,"And it eventually gets turned into a mosque, and today, it is a museum. The Hagia Sophia literally means holy wisdom. You might recognize the word Sophia from philosophy, which literally means friend of wisdom, philosophia. Now, perhaps what Justinian is most famous for is his attempt to better codify a set of laws."
Social Studies,"The Roman Empire, of course, always had laws, but Justinian got legal experts to go and collect the laws of the land, to make them consistent, to throw out the laws that are inconsistent, to add new laws as necessary. And he did this over his entire reign, and he spread them. And they are often referred to as the Code of Justinian. And they would have an influence on the Byzantine Empire for the next 900 years and even some influence on some relatively modern schools of law."
Social Studies,"Now, as I've mentioned before, the reign of Justinian is considered really the high point of the Byzantine Empire. And even as we get into roughly the second half of his reign, things start to slide downward, and over the next 900 years, are just in a state of decline. Starting in the 540s, there's a significant plague in the Byzantine Empire. Some accounts I've seen show that roughly 40% of Constantinople dies, significant chunk of the population of the Byzantine Empire dies."
Social Studies,"And that makes it more susceptible to attack from the various Germanic tribes throughout Justinian's reign. And well after Justinian's reign, there's constant tension and often conflict between the Sassanid Persians in the east. And then, as we go further on, especially as we get into the seventh and eighth century, you have the rise of Islam."
Social Studies,"Early Islamic empires are able to take over the Sassanids and significantly eat into the Byzantine Empire and then even some of the Germanic kingdoms in the Iberian peninsula. And so, this is taking us now, we're in the middle of the eighth century."
Social Studies,"And if we go further on, we see this once again gradual decline continue on, where you have further invasions into the Byzantine Empire from Turkish Muslim kingdoms or Turkish Muslim conquerors, all the way until we get to 1453, when Constantinople itself falls to the Turks and eventually gets renamed Istanbul.."
Social Studies,"And most historians mark the beginning of the Byzantine Empire with the rule of Constantine, who moves the capital to Byzantium, it gets renamed Constantinople. But as we've talked about in multiple videos, in 476, you have the fall of the western Roman Empire and the west becomes fragmented, a bunch of various Germanic kingdoms, but the eastern Roman Empire with its capital at Constantinople, continues."
Social Studies,"And once again, they did not call themselves the Byzantines, they called themselves the Romans, they called themselves the Roman Empire. It was only much much later that historians tried to separate this period of the Roman Empire by calling it the Byzantine Empire."
Social Studies,"There is a bit of a resurgence under Justinian, he's able to capture significant portions of the west including the Italian peninsula but then over time the Byzantine Empire contracts, especially in the east, it has to contend with the spread of Islam. As we go even further in time, as we enter into the second millennium, we can see that the Muslim Turks make further inroads into the Byzantine Empire. Also during the Fourth Crusades, western crusaders sack Constantinople."
Social Studies,"And we can go all the way to 1453 where all that was left at the time of the Byzantine Empire or you could say the eastern Roman Empire is Constantinople and in 1453, that also gets sacked by the Ottomans and that's the official end of the Byzantine Empire, the eastern Roman Empire, which you can see continues on for another 1000 years after the fall of the western Roman Empire. Now with that review out of the way, let's think about how the Byzantine Empire was the same and different from the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,So first let's think about the center of power. Well the Roman Empire is named after its seat of power during the great majority of its history. The seat of power of the Roman Empire is Rome. Near the end of the western Roman Empire it becomes Ravenna and of course we talk about Constantine changing the capital to Byzantium which eventually became Constantinople and that's the official start of at least the roots of the Byzantine Empire although Constantine was emperor of both.
Social Studies,"It's fair to say that Rome was the capital of the Roman Empire from its early days as a kingdom all the way until the first several centuries of the common era. The roots of the Byzantine Empire are with Constantine changing the capital, the seat of power of the combined empire and moving it from Rome to Byzantium, which will eventually be called Constantinople. Now let's think about language. So the language of the Roman Empire is Latin."
Social Studies,"In the early days of the Byzantine Empire, Latin is used in conjunction with Greek but over time, it becomes more Greek. In fact, Heraclius in the seventh century makes Greek the official language of the Byzantine Empire. Now religion, for most of Roman history, their religion is the Roman Pantheon."
Social Studies,"Now near the end of what is called the Roman Empire, when Constantine comes around in the early fourth century, Christianity gets legalized and Theodosius, who is the last emperor to rule over both east and west, he makes Christianity the official religion. Since the eastern Roman Empire's roots, the Byzantine empire's roots are considered to be with Constantine. It has a Christian nature from the beginning and it only becomes more and more Christian over time."
Social Studies,"In other videos, we will talk about the eventual spiritual split between east and west, the Latin Christian church and the Greek Christian church and they're going to diverge more and more as we go into the year 1054 when there is the official Great Schism. In terms of law, the Roman Empire has a long tradition of law and I guess we could just call it the Roman law. In fact, so profound has its influence been on western civilization that many of our legal terms today come from Latin."
Social Studies,"What historians would consider the Byzantine Empire would continue Roman law, much of it written in Latin. Justinian would famously try to reform Roman law, make it more consistent, make it more clear. Justinian's code. And you have the emperor Leo III has the famous Ecloga but as you have these revisions and these reformations of Roman law, they are more and more written in Greek than Latin and they do have more and more of a Christian influence."
Social Studies,"In terms of governance, especially under the Roman Empire, the notion of a province was the main subdivision under which the empire was governed."
Social Studies,"Once you have Emperor Dioclesian come onto the scene and this is shortly before the time of Constantine, he reformed it and he set up what is known as a tetrarchy where you had these two emperors of east and west and then you would have essentially their subordinate emperors but along with that, he redefined what a province is, so you had smaller provinces which then would go into diocese, which would then go into prefects, which would then go into a tetrarch."
Social Studies,"Once you have the start of the Byzantine Empire, they would have elements of this."
Social Studies,"Constantine, remember Constantine wasn't only the Byzantine, wasn't only the emperor of the east, he was emperor of both east and west, but he got rid of the tetrarchy but he kept Dioclesian's notions of these smaller provinces going into diocese, going into prefects, so you have that continuity but then later on in the mid seventh century, it was turned into more of a feudal-themed system in the Byzantine Empire, and once again, this was under Heraclius who also made Greek the official language."
Social Studies,"And the reason why I say it's feudal, it was comparable to the feudal system in western Europe at the time, was that it provided land grants to local rulers in exchange for their military service and the ability for them to send resources up to the emperor."
Social Studies,"In terms of culture, you have many of the things that we associate with the Roman Empire, you have chariot racing, you have gladiator fights, you have imperial birthdays, you have the Olympics, which carries over from the Ancient Greeks that actually lasts over 1000 years as we go into the Roman Empire. Some of these continue and some of them don't."
Social Studies,"So for example, the notion of chariot racing does and famously Justinian is almost overthrown after a rowdy chariot race, you don't have the Olympics, Theodosius felt that it wasn't in line with Christian tradition, but you did have things like imperial celebrations, imperial birthdays, so the Byzantine Empire definitely continued some of the traditions but also eliminated others. So this is a just a rough overview. I encourage you to think about it yourself."
Social Studies,"Are we missing any dimensions? And what other aspects do you think were the same as we go from the traditional Roman Empire into the continuation of the Roman Empire, which historians will later call the Byzantine Empire?."
Social Studies,"Now what we're going to do in this video is we're going to look at maps of the various time periods of the Middle Ages. The Middle Ages are broadly divided into three major sections, the early Middle Ages, from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to about the year 1000."
Social Studies,"The high Middle Ages, which was a high point for the Middle Ages in Europe which goes from about what the year 1000 to the year 1300, and then the late Middle Ages, which gets us to the 15th century and it's considered not that pleasant of a time to live in Europe. So let's just start with what Europe looked like right after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. So as you can see here, this map is referring to the time period between 476 when Odoacer takes over Rome and 493."
Social Studies,"And you can see the Eastern Roman Empire is still here but the Western Roman Empire is now fragmented amongst many Germanic kingdoms, you have the Visigoths, you have the Franks, you have the Kingdom of Odoacer. With the fall of Rome we are entering into the early Middle Ages."
Social Studies,"Now the Eastern Roman Empire which considers itself the Roman Empire its capital at Constantinople under Justinian has a little bit of a last horah and is able to recapture the Italian peninsula so it's able to recapture some of the territory that was formally part of the Western Roman Empire, some of the territory in North Africa that you don't see on this map. But for the most part Western Europe stays under the control of various Germanic kingdoms."
Social Studies,"So here we have fast forwarded to the year 814 which would be right around here on our timeline. And you can see a major event has occurred either on the map or on this timeline. You have Charlemagne king of the Franks crowned Holy Roman Emperor. On the map, you can see Charlemagne's empire right over here he has conquered Northern Italy, much of what we consider modern day France, much of what we consider modern day Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium."
Social Studies,"Charlemagne is really one of the defining figures of the Middle Ages and especially the early Middle Ages. As you can see, he's able to unify much of Western Europe. A lot of our ideas about kings and castles and knights begin to emerge around the time of Charlemagne. This notion of being a Holy Roman Emperor because he's able to provide protection to the Pope. The Pope says hey I'm going to say that you are continuing on the legacy of the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"Now as we'll see and we cover in much more detail in other videos, the title of Holy Roman Emperor or Emperor of the Romans, does not continue on with Charlemagne's descendants, but when you get to 962, Otto who is a German king is crowned Holy Roman Emperor again and you continue to have Holy Roman Emperors all the way until 1806."
Social Studies,"Now another major feature of the early Middle Ages and you can see it on this map, is that Islam in the 7th and 8th centuries comes out of Arabia and is able to conquer much of the Middle East, Persia, North Africa, which you don't see on this map, and much of what we consider today to be modern day Spain and you can see it, do you see the Caliphate or Cordova right over here. You see the Abbassids here in the east who also controlled much of North Africa. Now let's fast forward to the high Middle Ages."
Social Studies,"So here we are in the year 1135 on our timeline that would be right about, let's see this is 1100, that would be 1150 1135 would put us right around here. And you could already see some interesting things on this map, the Holy Roman Empire under Charlemagne is now fragmented, the Western third is now the Kingdom of France, the Eastern 2/3 are still considered the Roman Germanic Empire or the Holy Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"And even though it looks fairly unified in this map, over different periods of time it's really a bunch of fragmented Germanic kingdoms nominally under this Holy Roman Empire sometimes it's a little bit more unified under a stronger Holy Roman Emperor. Now the other things that you see and we saw it on the last map is that the Byzantine Empire is continuing to lose territory and you can see the Muslim empires in this case it's the Seljuk Turks are able to take even more territory."
Social Studies,Now one of the things that has happened by the time we look at this map and it's not clear by looking on the map is that you have in 1054 the Great Schism between the Latin Church centered at Rome and the Eastern Greeks Church centered at Constantinople and we have a whole series of videos on that and all of the factors that led to it.
Social Studies,"But as we get to the time of this map one of the things that the high Middle Ages is most known for, the Great Schism or the East-West Schism is one of the them, the Schism between what eventually becomes the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, but what the high Middle Ages are also known for are the Crusades. As already mentioned you see how the Seljuk Turks are able to take much of Anatolia, much of the peninsula from the Byzantine Empire."
Social Studies,"And the West decides to send what will eventually be called Crusaders to help regain land from the Muslims. And so that's where you see the Crusades beginning in 1096 at the very end of the 11th century. You can see the multiple crusades that occur over roughly the next 200 years. And the Crusaders were trying to reclaim land from the Muslims and especially the Holy Land, much of which is below the map where you can't quite see it over here."
Social Studies,But it turns out that when they are able to reclaim some of that land they don't give it back to the Byzantines they set up what are known as Crusader Kingdoms and you can see some of them right over here in this bluish color. So once again you had this East-West Schism and the Crusades are further expanding the division between east and west.
Social Studies,"And that really becomes significant in 1204 when the Crusaders themselves sack Constantinople, take Constantinople from the Byzantines, so that's in some ways the point of no return. The Byzantines are eventually able to take Constantinople back but this is really the beginning of the end for the Byzantine Empire."
Social Studies,"Now even though the high Middle Ages are known for this tension between east and west The Great Schism, even though it's known for the Crusades, most of which were fairly unsuccessful despite being very very very bloody for the Crusaders, the high Middle Ages were considered a high point for the Middle Ages. Farming technology coupled with better weather actually significantly increased agricultural productivity at this time."
Social Studies,"But then roughly in the year 1300, historians consider ourselves moving into the late Middle Ages. So you can see here in this map by the late Middle Ages, Europe is starting to resemble the Europe that we know in later periods once we get into the Renaissance and the Age of Exploration. By this point, much of the Iberian Peninsula has been reclaimed from Muslim rule although you still have Muslim rule in Granada."
Social Studies,"Most of the Byzantine Empire has now been taken over by the Ottomans, save Constantinople, Constantinople eventually falls in 1453. This map right over here is roughly what Europe looked like in the 14th century. So this period right over here, Constantinople falls in 1453 ending the Byzantine Empire formally. And what the late Middle Ages is most known for is being not that pleasant of a time to live in Europe."
Social Studies,"In 1347, you have the Black Death, which by some estimates kills 50 million people in Europe, which is roughly 60% of the population at the time. It's also a time of famine, the weather cycles get worse and even before the Black Death you have a significant famine occurring in the 14th century. You can see right over here between 1337 and 1453 you have the Hundred Years' War between France and England which lasts over 100 years, once again not a pleasant time to live in especially Western Europe."
Social Studies,"But as we get into the end of the 15th and especially into the 16th century, historians consider that to be the end of the Middle Ages and we start getting into the Age of Exploration and the Renaissance which we will discuss in future videos.."
Social Studies,"Now many of you are probably familiar with some of the key actors within the feudal system. At the top, you would have a king. Now, the king would rule over a kingdom. Now this is not so easy to govern, especially during the Middle Ages, and the king might owe many people things, especially people who helped the king come to power, helped him depose the previous king or to conquer this land. And so, in exchange for that, and to help govern, he might grant land or fiefs to other people."
Social Studies,"And the key currency in the Middle Ages under the feudal system is land and land in exchange for loyalty and service. So, this whole thing is a kingdom. Now, right over here, this is a duchy and a duchy will be controlled by a duke. I guess they didn't call it ducky because that just doesn't sound as serious. So, the king might grant a duchy, a duchy, to a duke, and in exchange, the duke would provide loyalty, pledge their fealty."
Social Studies,"If the kingdom is threatened, the duke will fight alongside the king, would provide their own troops. If the king wants to go conquer other territories, same thing, and also provide the king with taxes, which might be in the form of coinage, depending on what time and region we are in the Middle Ages or it might be in the form of a percentage of the agricultural production from this duchy. Now the terminology here is that the duke would be one of the king's vassals or would be vassal to the king."
Social Studies,"Now a duchy tends to be a fairly large amount of territory. In medieval England, a duke was the highest title of nobility. There was variations on duke. Now the duke might have his own manor or might even have multiple manors that he rules directly over that has his own serfs or free peasants working that land, providing output, which helps generate some of the tax revenue that goes to the king or provides some of the necessities for the duke's own household."
Social Studies,"But the rest of the duchy, they might subdivide further and they would be lord over their own vassals. So, for example, this piece of land right over here, this duke might provide it to someone else, let's say a count, in which case this would be called a county, and that is where we get our modern term, county. And this count would be vassal to the duke and the duke would be the lord of the count. And then the count can then be the lord of someone else, of their vassals."
Social Studies,"And this goes on and on and on, all the way until you get down to the level of the serfs and the peasants, who are actually doing the work. But the main idea here is that in exchange for land, the king gave his duke a duchy, or maybe the king's father gave this duke's father this duchy, and so this grant of land, this is called a fief, a critical term in the feudal system. This county here, this is a fief. In exchange for that, the vassal gives the lord resources, taxes, and loyalty."
Social Studies,"Now the way I drew it here, it seems quite organized and clean, but the reality of it, it isn't that clean. Sometimes, a kingdom might directly, some parts of it might be subdivided into duchies, some of it might be divided into a county that is independent of any duchy. You might have another duchy right over here that is not subdivided into counties. You might have one count that is more powerful than another count, or one count that might even be more powerful than a duke someplace else."
Social Studies,"So it can actually be quite chaotic and hard to keep track of. And this isn't all of the players. I mentioned some of the titles of nobility, like duke and count, and then below count you might have a baron. In England, the equivalent of count was an earl, who still presided over a county and their wife was a countess. And when I say preside, they had almost full control over it. They would even give justice over the people who happen to be within their fiefdom."
Social Studies,"Now, I started this video showing a picture of a knight on horseback and knights are probably one of the strongest association with medieval times, so many of you are probably thinking, where do knights fit into this? The knight refers to slightly different things, depending on what region you are in or what time period within the Middle Ages, but it generally refers to a mounted soldier, someone skilled in fighting, someone who might have knight's armor."
Social Studies,"But over time, it became a prestigious title that was given by a monarch or by a lord in exchange for service, oftentimes military service. You might have a knight who is granted a fief from, say, this count right over here, and say, they might be lord of their own manor. They might have their own serfs who are not quite slaves, but they're bonded laborers who cannot leave and don't have a lot of rights, working the field. You might have other knights who got the title but did not get the land."
Social Studies,"And to complicate things further, any of these characters can have multiple titles. For example, this duke might also be knighted. Now, it's worth noting that these titles of nobility, duke, count, baron, earl, these tended to be hereditary. You would pass it down from one generation to the next, as long as the next generation pledged fealty to their lord. The title knight, however, was given for service and did not tend to be passed down from generation to generation."
Social Studies,"And to be clear, these still aren't all the actors here. You also have the church, which during medieval times, was a very powerful institution. At the top of the church, you had the bishop of Rome, also known as the pope, and you had their bishops in significant regions. You also had monastic orders, where you might have an abbot, who is the head of a monastery, where you have monks, who, as part of that monastery, are praying. They might be farming, they might be copying texts."
Social Studies,"And there's also power dynamics between these. And as we're about to see, you can even have these non-religious figures pledging fealty to religious figures. So just to get a sense of what these pledges of fealty were like. You have a vassal. In this homage ceremony, homage, or sometimes said homage, it really comes from the French word, homme, which refers to man. So he is pledging to be his lord's man. So this would be the lord right over here."
Social Studies,"And this is an actual pledge given by Bernard Atton, Viscount of Carcassonne, in the year 1110 in France. ""In the name of the Lord, I, Bernard Atton,"" and I apologize for my pronunciation, ""Viscount of Carcassonne, in the presence of my sons,"" and he goes on to list his sons. ""Nobles, and of many other honorable men, ""who have come to the monastery of St."
Social Studies,"Mary of Grasse,"" or Grasse, ""since lord Leo , abbot of the said monastery, ""has asked me, in the presence of all those above mentioned, ""to acknowledge to him the fealty and homage"" or homage ""for the castles, manors, and places which the patrons, ""my ancestors, held from him and his predecessors ""and from the said monastery as a fief, ""and which I ought to hold as they held, ""I have made to the lord abbot Leo ""acknowledgement and homage as I ought to do."" So, in this case, the lord is an abbot, is a religious figure, is the head of a monastery and the vassal is a viscount."
Social Studies,"You can kinda view them as vice count. And notice, he's pledging fealty to the abbot. And in this case, it looks like Bernard Atton's ancestors were already vassals to the abbot and so this is really renewing it and so that the viscount could essentially keep his fief. Now to appreciate how complicated this could get, here on the timeline you see when Henry the Second lived, and as you can see, he had many titles. He was eventually King of England. You can see southern England up here."
Social Studies,"He was Duke of Normandy, Duke of Aquitaine, which was interesting. He got that as a dowery when he marries Eleanor, whose previous husband was King Louis the Seventh of France. He is Count of Maine, Anjou, Touraine. And this is really interesting. He's a king of one kingdom, the Kingdom of England, but he is also a duke and a count within another kingdom, the kingdom of France. But this gives you a sense of, to some degree, how chaotic the Middle Ages were."
Social Studies,"It wasn't well organized like under the Roman empire or under ancient Persia or even most nation states today. It was many different kingdoms organized into many different duchies and counties. There wasn't a very clear rhyme and reason and positions and power constantly shifted, depending on loyalty, wars, marriages, and inheritance.."
Social Studies,"And you keep going all the way down until you get to a plot of land where the actual work might occur. And that term is often referred to as a manor. A manor just doesn't happen at the bottom of this pyramid. A duke can have a manor and they can split up the rest of their duchy and give sections of it to form counties that could be led by counts. But what we're going to focus in this video is the manor itself, because that's where life in a medieval community actually takes place."
Social Studies,"And the work on a manor is done essentially by the lowest rung of the ladder and that is both free peasants and also by serfs. To get a sense of what a medieval manor could have looked like, here's a picture and this would've been a particularly fancy manor right over here. This is a ducal manor, so this would have been the manor of a duke, so it could be something like that right over there."
Social Studies,"And in this picture, you see the manor house which in this case is the duke's castle, in many medieval communities were the highest ranking of the nobility right beneath the king. And so we see these people actually working the field. We don't know from looking up at them, some of them might be free peasants, maybe this gentleman right over here is a free peasant. And this person right over here is a serf."
Social Studies,"The word of serf comes from the Latin for service, the same word that eventually gives us words like servant and they're someplace in between a free peasant and a slave. They are bonded to the lord of the manor. In this case it would be a duke, but you can go down this hierarchy, you could have a manor where the lord is a baron or the lord is a knight, or the lord is just someone who is very wealthy and somehow got access to a fiefdom. So the serfs are bonded to the land."
Social Studies,"They can't leave without their permission. They are allowed to cultivate certain tracts of land themselves, but they also have to work for their lord. So they might help plant crops and harvest crops in the lord's land as well and they also give a percentage of everything that they grow or everything that they do to the actual lord. And if the lord needs to go into war, they might have to be soldiers in that war. You might be wondering, well that sounds pretty bad, it sounds similar to being a slave."
Social Studies,"One of the key differences is that a serf actually can accumulate things on their own. They can actually own property. Now another term or sometimes a subcategorization of serf in the Middle Ages is the term villain. I know what you're thinking, you have heard that term before. The villain today means a bad guy."
Social Studies,"But the term originally comes from the Roman Empire when Diocletian, the famous emperor who persecuted Christians, he also, because they were having trouble getting labor in rural villas, he began to decree that certain people had to work in the villas. And so someone who was compelled to work at a villa was called a villain, and so they were bonded to the land. They were a type of serf."
Social Studies,"Now the fact that villain in English, it means someone who is bad, it gives you an idea how in a lot of languages in a lot of cultures, the notion of being captive or bonded and poor gets associated with being bad which seems very contrary to our modern view of the world. Get a top-level view of what a manor might look like. We don't know what type of manor this is in particular, but the manor house here seems a little bit more humble than this ducal manor right over here."
Social Studies,"This could be a, maybe a baron's manor house. Now the manner often had a village. This is where the serfs or the free peasants might live, keep their homes. And then you see the land that is cultivated collectively by this community, not just the actors that we've just talked about, you might also have a church or monastery on that manor right over here. And these strips of land, they might have different crops. And the output of those crops go to different people."
Social Studies,"The one common factor is the lord of the manor might get all of the crops from some of these strips, while on the other strips, they get the taxation. So they'll get a certain percentage from the crops there. But all of the work is done by the serfs and the free peasants and possibly if there some, if this is a monastery, and there's some monks at the monastery."
Social Studies,"Now one interesting thing is why you often see in these manor maps, these long strips of land, and our resident agricultural expert at Khan Academy, David Rheinstrom, says it's because the medieval plows once you got going, you didn't want to turn them around, you got some momentum. And so people liked the plant crops in these long strips so the plows could just keep going in one direction and only at the end, they just have to turn it around."
Social Studies,So you're minimizing the number of times that you actually have to turn around to plow..
Social Studies,"But for now, we'll refer to them as popular uprisings, which means that they involved a lot of common people. As we look at these events, we want to keep two questions in mind, sort of big-picture questions. The first is why did people choose to revolt against their government? And especially after about the 1320s, we see a huge number of these popular uprisings in a way that just didn't happen prior to this point."
Social Studies,"So why did this happen? Why did people rebel? And secondly, we want to think about were these uprisings successful? And if so, what does success look like in these circumstances? So I want to start with a specific example, and that example is the Peasants' Revolt in England. This occurs in the year 1381. So we have a picture here, and this is a picture from The Chronicles of Jean Froissart, and he is writing his chronicles of what's going on at the same time that these events are occurring."
Social Studies,"So it's a contemporary account. The picture is actually from later. It's added back into the Chronicles later, so the picture is not entirely accurate of the period, but it does give us a sense of what it might look like for the king to be confronted by thousands of angry subjects. But to go into what they were doing there, I want to start with a quote and this again comes from The Chronicles of Jean Froissart that I mentioned and this is a quote that he attributes to John Ball."
Social Studies,"John Ball is an English priest who is preaching at this time and is considered maybe one of the instigators, one of the people who helps start this revolt in 1381 and part of that is he's spreading ideas that challenge the existing authority structure. And he goes on and says, ""Ah ye good people, ""the matters goeth not well to pass in England,"" and that's kind of an old-time way of saying things aren't going well in England."
Social Studies,"And then he goes on and says, ""Nor shall not do till everything be common ""and that there be no villains nor gentlemen, ""but that we may all be united together ""and that the lords be no greater masters than we be it."" So what he's saying there is we have this structure of society in England where there are the gentlemen, the people who are part of the nobility, and they have this access to political power and economic power."
Social Studies,And then we have all these other people who have to basically do work to support this nobility. And he says we should really all be equal and things aren't going to be well in England until we are. So that's a pretty radical message especially for a medieval European country.
Social Studies,"And he goes on and askes this question and says, ""What have we, what have we the common people deserved or why should we be kept thus in servage, servitude or bondage, ""We be all come from one father ""and one mother, Adam and Eve, ""whereby can they say or show that ""they'd be greater lords than we be."" And what he's doing there is making an appeal to the Old Testament of the Bible and saying that everybody is descended from the same pair of people."
Social Studies,"So we all really are equal in that sense, so why is it that the nobility have access to this greater power and wealth. I should point out that this idea of challenging the social hierarchy is not the only thing that's motivating rebels in the Peasants' revolt in England here. There are a lot of other factors, and we'll talk about those a little later."
Social Studies,"So when we talk about medieval European society, before this point we have a structure that has three estates, three levels or classes you could think of this as. And we have the clergy which are priests or friars, and basically anyone involved with the church and that is the group of those who pray. You have the nobility and this is going to be your Knights, your people who are in control of large tracts of land that they hold in service to the king and to the kingdom and those are the people who fight."
Social Studies,"And then at the bottom you have the people who work, which is including most of the population. Remember this is a low technology agricultural society. We're talking about probably 90% plus of the population is involved in agricultural production in some way. So this is the largest chunk of society and they refer to that as the peasantry. So to recap that your your model is you have those who pray, those who fight, and those who work."
Social Studies,"The society needs all of these roles to function properly, so all of them are important. So we want to think about how do we go from this situation where we have this relatively stable social order where the different estates are seen as more or less equally important members of society to what we see in England in 1381 where the people rise up and challenge the authority of the king."
Social Studies,"So there are three broad areas of analysis that we can use to better understand why we see these popular revolts breaking out throughout the 14th century. The first one of those is demographics or the study of population. And we have two major events that significantly impact Europe's population here. The first one is the Great Famine which occurs between 1315 and 1317, and that refers to a sequence of poor agricultural harvests due to poor weather for agriculture at this time."
Social Studies,"The other event that has a major impact on Europe's population is the outbreak of the plague, the Black Death it's called, which occurs between 1347 and 1349 here. And this ends up killing between a third and a half of Europe's population. So what you see is a big increase in how much it costs to hire workers. And you actually see in England for example, in 1349 and 1351, you see a couple of laws passed that try to keep workers wages at pre-plague levels."
Social Studies,"So it's a response to the fact that there are now fewer workers and that makes workers more expensive. On top of that, you also have the Hundred Years' War going on between England and France. It starts in 1337 and drags on actually for more than a hundred years, but that's the name they've given it. But that's expensive."
Social Studies,"That costs both governments a lot of money to keep fighting and maintaining militaries and so at the same time that you have these economic problems and struggles, you also have government's raising taxes on people to try and pay for this conflict. And the last thing that helps explain some of these uprisings these popular uprisings, we saw a little bit already in John Ball's quote, but we have religious and cultural issues going on as well."
Social Studies,"The mendicant orders, the Franciscans and the Dominicans who are friars, who go around and preach to common people and preach the value of poverty and simple living. So when you have nobility who are living very lavish and extravagant lifestyles, you have some some pushback against that as being perhaps against the popular religious attitudes of the time. I mentioned at the beginning that we would talk a little bit about whether or not a peasant revolt was the proper name for these events."
Social Studies,"And we have in 1358 an event, known as the Jacquerie, which is a popular uprising in the north of France spurred because of issues relating to the Hundred Years' War, actually. And the Jacquerie gets its name from the fact that common people kind of generically called, Jacques Bonhomme, like a regular guy was a Jacques Bonhomme, and then that just translates to something roughly like, Jack Goodfellow."
Social Studies,"So what you see is the elites, the clergy, the nobility are applying this notion of being a peasant, of being a commoner, in kind of a derogatory or insulting way to anyone who's not part of the nobility or the clergy. And remember that when we said what a peasant really is it refers to a rural agricultural worker. These revolts, these uprisings, included a lot more than just rural agricultural workers."
Social Studies,"What they're trying to do is to dismiss the uprising as just bad behavior from people who don't know their place in society. But in reality, it's much more complex than that. So hopefully this starts to give us a sense of why did people revolt against the government at this time. We had these demographic changes that lead to these economic changes, and that leads in some ways to changes in how people view their roles in society."
Social Studies,"To think about whether or not these were successful, we want to think about more than just military success, because the fact is most of these popular uprisings lost militarily-speaking. The government had more than enough manpower and money to put down these popular uprisings. So when we think about whether or not these popular uprisings were successful, we want to think about did they lead to any major changes in the social or political structures. Even if they didn't win military victories."
Social Studies,"And in most cases, we do see some of those changes start to take shape.."
Social Studies,"This is a zoomed in version of what it looked like, and you can see these Crusader states that were set up, or these Crusader kingdoms, and, as I pointed out in the last video, even though the Crusades were apparently to help the Byzantines reclaim land, as you can see, when the Crusaders took the Holy Land, they, for the most part, kept it for themselves and sat up these kingdoms. So, we are about here. We are about here on our timeline."
Social Studies,"Now, as we fast forward a little over a decade, as we get to the middle of the 12th century, you do have the Muslims being able to take back some of the territory. In particular, Edessa and Aleppo, and so this spawns what will eventually be known as the Second Crusade, and it's really the second of many crusades. Now, these are what historians consider the official numbered crusades, but there were many other crusades in this time period, in roughly this 200 year time period during the High Middle Ages."
Social Studies,"You had crusades against Germanic non-Christians in Northern Europe. You had crusades in Spain in order to retake land from the Muslims, which they had for several hundred years, what's known as the Reconquista. So, after Aleppo and Edessa were taken, you have the Second Crusades, which end up being quite unsuccessful, and it really doesn't change what the Middle East looks like, but then, as you get to the end of the 12 century, you have a significant event."
Social Studies,"In 1187, you have the Sultan Salah ad-Din, often known as Saladin, being able to retake Jerusalem and much of the Holy Land. Remember, this is after roughly 90 years of rule of Jerusalem by the Western Europeans, by these Crusader kingdoms, so this really strikes a chord with the west, and so they decide to launch what will be known as the Third Crusade. The Third Crusade does make some gains. In fact, this is a crusade that gets significant buy-in from the king of Western Europe."
Social Studies,"Philip the Second of France gets involved. The English king, Richard the First, or Richard the Lionheart, gets involved. The Holy Roman Emperor Fredrick Barbarossa gets involved. When I say Holy Roman Emperor and the empire, you should really think of medieval Germany. Now, as they go there, Fredrick Barbarossa, he drowns in a river."
Social Studies,"This is very dispiriting for his soldiers, so many of them turn around, but Philip the Second and Richard the Lionheart are able to engage with Salah ad-Din, and they are able to gain some land. In particular, the region around Acre, and they're able to get some concessions from Salah ad-Din for unarmed Christian pilgrims to visit the Holy Land, especially Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"Now, Salah ad-Din dies as we approach the end of the 12 century, so in the beginning of the 13th century, the Fourth Crusades get launched, and these are interesting because the Crusaders, with the help of Venetian traders, they actually engage with the claimant to the throne of the Byzantine Empire, with the hope that if they can help them come back to the throne, then they can provide them the necessary resources in order to continue on with the Crusades."
Social Studies,"Well, they are able to put the claimant on the throne, but then an uprising takes that claimant down from the throne, and so the Crusaders don't get their payment, but they want that payment badly, and so, they decide to take Constantinople themselves, and as we mention in other videos, this is really the dagger in the heart between the relationship between the East and the West."
Social Studies,"We already talked about the Great Schism of 1054, but now, you have the West, who are followers of the Latin Church, which eventually gets known as the Roman Catholic Church. They are sacking Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine, or the Eastern Roman Empire, the most important city in Eastern Christiandom, and once they successfully sack the city in bloody fashion, they break up the Byzantine Empire amongst themselves, and you can see how they break it up."
Social Studies,"So, the Fourth Crusade had very little effect on the actual Holy Land, but it does cause a temporary end to the Byzantine Empire. As we get to 1261, Constantinople is retaken by the Byzantines, but once again, this is the beginning of the end of the Byzantine Empire. The fact that for half a century, it was taken over by the West, so you can imagine, with Jerusalem still in the hands of the Muslims, many in the West are not satisfied, and in 1212, an interesting event may have occurred."
Social Studies,"There are some accounts of what is known as a Children's Crusade. The stories of the Children Crusade are that a child, and there's different accounts as to exactly the story, but something to the effect that Jesus has told them to go with other pure children to the Holy Land and convert the Muslims to Christianity, and so then, they go on this march, and there's tens of thousands of children, but they don't make it to the Holy Land. They either die of starvation or they get sold into slavery on the way."
Social Studies,"Historians today aren't sure whether it really happened as that account implies. That's why I put these question marks next to the Children's Crusade, but regardless of the actual facts here, as we go into the first quarter of the 13th century, Jerusalem remains in the hands of the Muslims. A Fifth Crusade is launched to retake Jerusalem, which is a failure."
Social Studies,"Eventually, a Sixth Crusade is launched, and this is reasonably successful at retaking some land in the Holy Land, but shortly thereafter, you have a non-numbered crusade, the Barrens Crusade, that rivals the First Crusade in its success in taking territory, and so you can see, after the Barrens Crusade right over here, they're able to take back a good amount of territory, but then, in 1244, Jerusalem is retaken by the Muslims, and then you have the Seventh and Eighth and Ninth Crusades afterwards, and you have these other efforts that are sometimes called Crusades, but for the most part, these are unsuccessful, and as we get into the end of the 13th and early 14th centuries, the Holy Land falls back under Muslim control."
Social Studies,"This is a map of the region as we enter into the 14th century, and you can see that the Muslims have retaken not just the Holy Land, but most of the Anatolian Peninsula, with only Constantinople being in control of the Byzantines, and that lasts until 1453, when the Turks finally take Constantinople as well. When you look at the map at the beginning of this video and look at the map here, you can see that the Crusades weren't really successful at changing the picture in the Holy Land."
Social Studies,"There were areas where the Crusades were successful, or that Crusader mentality was successful. You can see that, now that we're in the 14th century, much of the Iberian Peninsula has been taken by Christian kingdoms from the Muslims. The Muslims, at this period, are left with only Grenada, so the Reconquista, to some degree, was successful, and it's going to continue until 1492, when the last Muslims are expelled from Spain."
Social Studies,"Now, one thing that I felt when I study the Crusades is it's very confusing how Jerusalem in particular goes back and forth between different parties, and just to get an overview of what actually happened, this timeline might be helpful. Green shows Jerusalem under Muslim control. Red shows it under Christian control, so at the end of the First Crusades, it switches hands. The Christians are in control all the way until Salah ad-Din takes it back."
Social Studies,"Now, the Muslims are in control all the way until you get to the Sixth Crusade, where they're able to take some territory back and even parts of Jerusalem, and especially in the Barrens Crusades, they're able to take significant territory back, but in 1244, Jerusalem is retaken again by the Muslims.."
Social Studies,"Now, Muslims are very sensitive to this, because they don't view Muhammad as a divine figure the way that Christians view Christ. They view Muhammad as a human, a human whose practices and whose life they view, they revere, but they don't view him as a divine figure. They view him as the messenger who revealed God's words through the Quran, and they take this so seriously in most Muslim traditions, they don't create images of Muhammad for fear that people would start to worship it as some type of an idol."
Social Studies,"Now, on this timeline, you see other significant Judeo-Christian figures, and that's because according to Muslims, they are following in the same tradition of these figures. They view these other figures as people who have submitted to the will of God, and Moses and Jesus in particular are the most frequently mentioned prophets in the Quran. Now, Muslims also believe that the Quran isn't the first book that God had revealed to mankind."
Social Studies,"They also believe that the Torah, which is the first five books of the Hebrew bible, and also the first five books of the Christian Old Testament, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, they believe that to be a revealed text from God through the prophet Moses. They also believe that Psalms is a revealed text from God through King David, so through the prophet David, who lived around 1000 BCE, and they think that the Gospel is a revealed message through Jesus."
Social Studies,"Now, above and beyond these revealed texts, another significant part of the Muslim tradition or faith are the notions of Sunnah and Hadith, and Sunnah are the practices and life and sayings of Muhammad, and many of them are accounted for in the Hadith."
Social Studies,"Hadith are second hand accounts of other people who lived at the time of Muhammad, although many of them were written decades or sometimes hundreds of years later, and so it is a debate in the Muslim community on which Hadiths are considered more trustworthy than others. The one commonality, regardless of sect, is a centrality of the Quran and viewing that as the actual word of God."
Social Studies,"To see this a little bit more concretely in terms of how much Muslims view themselves as the same tradition that we see from the Old and New Testament, here are some Quranic quotes, and the first one essentially speaks to this core idea of being in that same tradition."
Social Studies,"""He has ordained for you of religion ""what He enjoined upon Noah ""and that which we have revealed to you, O Muhammad, ""and what we enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus, ""to establish the religion and not be divided therein."" And this is speaking to the importance of Abraham."
Social Studies,"""And who is better in religion than ""one who submits himself to God while being a doer of good ""and follows the religion of Abraham, ""inclining toward truth? ""And God took Abraham as a friend."" And Abraham in particular plays a very central role."
Social Studies,"The Kaaba, which Muslims view as the house of God, based in Mecca, right over here, is viewed as being built by Abraham and Ishmael, and so Medina, which is where in future videos we'll talk more about, where the early Muslims sought exile to escape persecution, that's often viewed as the city of Muhammad, but Mecca, which is the direction that all Muslims pray in during their ritual five times a day prayer, which we'll talk about in a little bit, that's often referred to as the city of Abraham."
Social Studies,"And now here is reference to Moses. ""And before it was the scripture of Moses ""to lead and as a mercy. ""And this is a confirming book in an Arabic tongue, so this"" this being the Quran. This is a quote from the Quran. ""And this is a confirming book in an Arabic tongue ""to warn those who have wronged ""and as good tidings to the doers of good."" So once again, a very clear message, in at least the Islamic tradition, that this is the same faith or tradition as that of Moses. And now here's reference to Jesus."
Social Studies,"""Then we caused our messengers to follow in their footsteps ""and we caused Jesus, son of Mary, ""to follow and gave him the Gospel ""and placed compassion and mercy ""in the hearts of those who followed him."" The key difference between Muslims and Christians in terms of the life of Jesus, is that Muslims do not believe in the crucifixion and the resurrection, and they do not believe that Jesus was God or the son of God."
Social Studies,"They believe him to be a very significant prophet, the prophet before Muhammad came to reveal to the Quran. Now, for a practicing Muslim, there are often considered to be five pillars, and this is especially the case for the majority of Muslims, for Sunni Muslims. Shia Muslims have a slightly different combination of pillars, but there's a lot of commonality. So the five pillars, the first is this notion of faith, which is referred to Shahadah."
Social Studies,"Shadahah can also be interpreted as testifying or testimony, and it's this notion that a Muslim needs to believe and say that there is no God but God. Muhammad is God's messenger. And in fact, to convert to Islam, you need to say this, and you have to say it in the presence of at least two witnesses, and that's all that's necessary in order to convert. Now, the other key element of Islam, the second you could say of the five pillars, is this notion of prayer."
Social Studies,"So Muslims pray five times a day at dawn, noon, in the afternoon, evening, and night, and they face in the direction of the Kaaba, which is based in Mecca, which once again, they believe that Abraham constructed with his son Ishmael, who they believe that the Arab people are descendant from. Now, what's interesting about this, this has a lot of parallels with the five times a day prayer of the Zoroastrians, including the ritual washing of your body before each prayer."
Social Studies,"Now, the third pillar is charity, and it's called Zakat, and this is customarily two and half percent of wealth. Now, two and half percent might not sound like a lot, but this isn't of income, this is of wealth."
Social Studies,"The fourth pillar is the notion of fasting dawn to dusk during the ninth month of the Islamic calender, and that month is Ramadan, and it's fasting without food or water, once again, from dawk to dusk, and the Islamic calender is a lunar calender, and the notion of a month, in fact in English, it comes from the word moon, because it's referring to a full cycle of the moon."
Social Studies,"Now, the end of this month ends with the Eid-al-Fitr, which is the Festival of Breaking the Fast, which is considered one of the two major holidays in Islam."
Social Studies,"Now, the fifth pillar of Islam is the notion of pilgrimage to the Kaaba during the 12th month, and it's during a certain period in that 12th month, and then also in that 12th month, you have the second major holiday in Islam, and that's Eid-al-Adha, the Festival of the Sacrifice, and that once again is making reference to Abraham and his willingness to sacrifice his son before God stops him. So this is the general idea of Islam."
Social Studies,"In other videos, we're going to go into much more detail in terms of how it started, the life of the Muslim prophet Muhammad in Mecca and Medina, and then how it spread through the world shortly after or even during the life of Muhammad in the sixth and seventh centuries of the common era.."
Social Studies,"Now, the term, Islam, means surrender and, as we'll see, a lot of the revelations of Muhammad are about surrendering to God, about the oneness of God, about not worshiping idols."
Social Studies,"And to put Muhammad in perspective, on a timeline, I have other significant biblical figures, here, and these are important not just to get a reference towards Christianity and Judaism, but because, according to Islamic tradition, Islam is built on top of the teachings of Abraham, or the teachings of Moses and the Torah, and the teachings of Jesus. Muslims believe that the Quran is the Final Testament, so to speak."
Social Studies,"To get some context, Muhammad was born is 6th Century Arabia, and 6th Century Arabia was an interesting place. In many other videos, we've talked about various empires around the Mediterranean, around the Mesopotamia and Persia. And even on this map, in the time of Muhammad, you see significant empires, the Byzantine Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire. You have Sasanid Persia. But Arabia was never really consolidated, or ruled, by a formal, or most of Arabia, by a formal government or a formal empire."
Social Studies,"The rule of law in most of Arabia, and the world in which Muhammad was born into, was a tribal world where you were protected by your tribe and it was really the laws of vendetta and revenge that kept certain things in check, but also would lead to a lot of wars and a lot of violence."
Social Studies,"And within Arabia, there were many folks who are Bedouins, who were nomadic people, who traveled through the desert allowing their livestock to graze on whatever suitable land they found, but you also had settled people in places like Mecca. You had people who'd settled and started agriculture around oases. Remember, most of the Arabian Peninsula is really desert. And, Muhammad was born into a fairly, or a very prominent family in Mecca."
Social Studies,"He was born to the Quraysh tribe, and the Quraysh tribe was essentially in control of Mecca, and Mecca was a very powerful city to control because it was a religious center for the region. This is the Kaaba, which exists today, and is the center of Islamic worship. And, at the time, it housed hundreds of idols which were important to the various tribes and people of Arabia at the time."
Social Studies,"And so, you can imagine as they did the pilgrimage towards Mecca to worship their idols, it also benefited the economy of Mecca in a significant way. And not only was Muhammad born into this powerful tribe, he was born into one of the most powerful clans within that tribe, and within one of the most powerful houses within that clan. But even though he was born into this very powerful family, clan, and tribe, his early life was quite difficult. His father died right before he was born."
Social Studies,"His mother dies at the age of six years old, and, then, his grandfather, who then takes custody of him, and by most accounts, he doesn't get a lot of privileges. When you're a member of a tribe, you're essentially orphaned. The tribe is doing, essentially, just the base necessities to keep you alive. But then his grandfather dies when he is eight years old, and he becomes, he goes under the custody of his uncle, Abu Talib. Now, as he grows older, he does learn a skill. He essentially becomes a merchant."
Social Studies,"He goes on trading journeys with his uncle, Abu Talib, to places like Syria. And, as he does that, according to Islamic tradition, he gets a very favorable reputation. He gets these titles like, Al-Amin, the trustworthy one, or Al-Sadiq, the truthful. Now, he continues doing that until the age of 25. At 25 years old, something very interesting happens."
Social Studies,"A very wealthy widow, arguably one of the wealthiest people in all of Mecca, who runs a vast trading enterprise, Khadija, who is 40 years old, she employs Muhammad and, apparently, is so impressed by his honesty, by his ability to be trustworthy, that she propose to him, and, remember, she's 40. This would be her third marriage, and he is 25, and he accepts the proposal."
Social Studies,"Now, this is significant because as we'll see in this video and the next, Khadija is the first one to follow Muhammad, or believe in Muhammad's revelations. So, he continues to work with his wife, arguably work for his wife, and, then, in 610, he's now 40 years old, he is praying in a cave on the outskirts of Mecca, and while he's praying, he is purported to get his first revelation from God, according to Islamic traditions."
Social Studies,"And that first revelation, and this is the mountain where it is purported to happen, the Mountain of Light, Jabal an-Nour. This is the cave, Cave Hira. The first revelation is, ""Proclaim, in the name of thy Lord ""and Cherisher, Who created man, ""out of a clot of congealed blood. ""Proclaim, and thy Lord is most bountiful, ""who taught by the pen, ""taught man that which he knew not."" And so Muhammad, according to Islamic accounts, he's kind of very concerned by this. He does not view himself as a preacher."
Social Studies,"He does not view himself as someone who should be a prophet, and he goes to Khadija, and he's worried, and Khadija takes him to her Christian cousin, who reassures Muhammad, who tells Muhammad that he believes that he is a prophet in the tradition of Abraham and Moses. And so, that, to some degree, makes Muhammad feel a little bit better, and he doesn't have some revelations for awhile, and he becomes concerned."
Social Studies,"But then, he eventually starts to have many, many revelations, but he keeps it to himself, at first. But, roughly three years later, he starts to publicly preach these revelations. So, these revelations which really talk about the oneness of God. There's no God but God. It's very appealing especially to some of the economically lower strata, but you could also imagine, it's very, very threatening to the establishment of Mecca."
Social Studies,"You have to remember, the establishment of Mecca, it revolves around the worship of these idols, and now you have this guy of the Quraysh tribe, the tribe that worships Hubal, the tribe that is in charge of Mecca, that benefits from all these people worshiping these various idols. He's know saying that, ""Idol worship is a sin."" He's saying that there's not God but God, that all of these idols are false idols."
Social Studies,"And so, the Quraysh tribe, Muhammad's own tribe, begins to significantly persecute the early Muslims. So much so, that many of the early Muslims have to migrate from Mecca to the Kingdom of Axum, which was ruled by a Christian king, who protects them the Quraysh tribe. This is now modern-day Ethopia, or Eritrea. And so, things are not going well for these early Muslims. They're being targeted by the Quraysh tribe. They're being killed. They're being tortured. And then, things get even worse for Muhammad."
Social Studies,"In 619, you have the death of his wife, Khadija. And, just to get a sense of how powerful Khadija was to Muhammad, we have this quote that we get from the Hadith, which are accounts of Muhammad's life and sayings, and it tell us, ""God Almighty never granted me anyone better ""in this life than her."
Social Studies,"""She accepted me when people rejected me, ""she believed in me when people doubted me, ""she shared her wealth with me when people deprived me, ""and God granted me children only through her."" This is, once again, according to the sayings or the life of Muhammad as accounted for by one of the Hadith. And not only did his wife, who up to that time was his only wife, die and was a significant figure, but in that same year, his uncle also dies."
Social Studies,"So, you can imagine this year, 619, often referred to as the Year of Sorrows, it's a fairly low point for Muhammad. He's been preaching for about, or he's been getting these revelations and preaching for around nine years, now, and things are not looking good.."
Social Studies,"His mother dies when he's six, his grandfather, who's taken charge of him, dies when he's eight years old, but he's able to, under the care of his uncle, become a merchant, and at the age of 25, he marries a wealthy merchant widow named Khadija, who is 15 years his senior. Then we saw, at age 40 in 610, while meditating in a mountain outside of Mecca, he receives the first revelations of the Qur'an according to Islamic tradition."
Social Studies,"And he's skeptical of it at first, but he's reassured, and then he soon receives many more revelations, and within roughly three years he starts to preach those revelations. Now as we mentioned in that last video, what he was preaching did not sit well with his own tribe. Those who ruled Mecca, the Quraysh."
Social Studies,"He was preaching a monotheistic tradition based on Judaism and Christianity, he was preaching that there is no god but God, but Mecca's power, it's economy, was based on people making pilgrimages there to worship the idols at the Kaaba. So the Quraysh did not like Muhammed's revelations, and they did not like these early Muslims. And they persecuted them."
Social Studies,"They killed them, they tortured them, and we saw in 615, the migration of some of Muhammed's followers to Abyssinia, the Kingdom of Axum, modern day Eritrea in Ethiopia, to escape some of that persecution. Things got worse for Muhammed. We saw in that last video the death of his first wife, and up to that point, his only wife. And this is where we start to see a bit of a turning point for Muhammed and his followers."
Social Studies,"In 620, and this is according to Muslim traditions, there isn't historical evidence for this and this is one of the more metaphysical events that we'll talk about in this narrative, but according to the Islamic faith, in 620, Muhammed had a night journey from Mecca to the farthest mosque, which today is believed by many Muslims to be the Al-Aqsa mosque, which was built later in Jerusalem. So, right, right, right over here."
Social Studies,"So a night journey, according to the Muslim faith, to Jerusalem where he ascended with Gabriel to the heavens, and he conversed with some of the prophets of old. And once again, this is clearly a metaphysical thing, but it's a significant event in the Muslim faith. Now the Quraysh continued to persecute Muhammed and the early Muslims in Mecca."
Social Studies,"We have some of them that are now in the Kingdom of Axum, and Muhammed learns that there's a community, a growing community, of Muslims in the town of Yathrib, who are starting to follow Muhammed, or his revelations, and they come to him and they invite him to come to Yathrib because there's actually a lot of fragmentation, there's warring tribes, and they're seeking an outsider to help bring some peace and authority to this place where there is already a burgeoning Muslim community."
Social Studies,"So in 622, you have the famous migration of Muhammed and his followers to Yathrib, which is renamed Medina, and Medina literally means The City. And from then on, it really becomes the base of Muhammed and the early Muslims. And Muhammed at this, once he's in Medina, he is no longer just a prophet, he isn't just continuing to have his revelations according to Islamic tradition, but he essentially rules over Medina, and governs it. So he's starting to become both a political ruler, and a spiritual ruler."
Social Studies,"Now, the Quraysh in Mecca are still not happy, because Muhammed is continuing to preach, and he's continuing to get more and more followers. And so you start having, at first, a series of skirmishes between the armies of the Quraysh, or the members of the Quraysh, and some of the early Muslims. But these skirmishes eventually emerge into full on conflict."
Social Studies,"And here are some of the significant battles that occurred between the Quraysh tribe, remember, that's Muhammed's own tribe, and the early Muslims, the early followers of Muhammed and his revelations."
Social Studies,"So most famously perhaps, you have the Battle of Badr, because this is the first time that you have a significant confrontation between a very small, you wouldn't even necessarily call this an army, a small group of Muslims, roughly a little over 300 according to Muslim tradition, versus 900, or a little over 900, on the Quraysh side."
Social Studies,"And the Muslims are outnumbered three to one, but this results in a Muslim victory, and so you can imagine the early Muslims start to see this as a turning tide, they were able to defeat the powerful Quraysh tribe. Now the Quraysh weren't happy with that, and roughly a year later you have another battle outside of Medina, on Mount Uhud."
Social Studies,"And once again, the Muslims, which are now larger, but they continue to be outnumbered even more than three to one, this is closer to four to one right over here, and this results in a Quraysh victory. This is right over there, outside on the northern side of what is now called Medina."
Social Studies,"But then, a few years later, you have a significant battle where the Quraysh have built a confederacy and they want to end this, the teachings of Muhammed, they wanna end these Muslims who are threatening, whose preachings are threatening the pilgrimage, the legitimacy of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca, and so they lay siege to the city of Medina."
Social Studies,"And as a defensive measure, the Muslims in Medina create a trench around the city, and that's why this is called the Battle of the Trench, and once again, according to Islamic tradition, the Muslims are outnumbered three to one, so this is right over here, the Battle, Battle of the Trench, in which the Muslims are victorious, and this is a significant blow to the legitimacy, the prestige of the Quraysh tribe."
Social Studies,"A year later, you have the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah between the Quraysh and the Muslims, and this is significant because it's starting to put these early Muslims on the same footing as the powerful Quraysh tribe. It has some allowances for the Muslims to make pilgrimages to the Kaaba. But then, as we go into 630, there's an incident in which one tribe is, kills some members of another tribe."
Social Studies,"Remember, we're still in a very tribal society, and the other tribe, the one that had some members killed, was aligned, was friendly, with the early Muslims. So the early Muslims did not appreciate this, they send an ultimatum to the Quraysh, and the Quraysh essentially say well, you know, that doesn't matter, we don't really take what you have to say seriously, and they take one of the options of the ultimatum, which is making the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah null and void."
Social Studies,"So, now that the treaty is not there, and once again this is according to Muslim traditions which are our main accounts that we have of this time, we then have in 630, 10,000 Muslims which is a very significant number, remember, where six years ago we're talking about only 300 Muslims in the Battle of Badr, but 10,000 Muslims march on Mecca. And they're able to take the city peacefully. And what this results in, is essentially most of the city converting to Islam."
Social Studies,"And famously, Muhammed goes into the Kaaba and destroys the idols there, and according to Islamic tradition, makes the Kaaba a center of the Muslim faith, and it is even today. Now from that point, the spread of Islam continues. You have Muhammed and his armies, this green area is essentially what they were able to conquer in the remainder of his life. And he lives for another, he lives, whoops, he lives for another two years after the acceptance of Islam by Mecca."
Social Studies,"And they're able to conquer most of this green, this dark green area here, and as we'll see shortly after his death, most of Arabia and even Persia, and within a few hundred years, a large chunk of the world were able to be conquered by these Muslim armies.."
Social Studies,"A poor shepherd people, he's referring to the Arabs before Mohammed, roaming unnoticed in its deserts since the creation of the world: a Hero-Prophet was sent down to them with a word they could believe; see the unnoticed becomes the world-notable, the small has grown world-great; within one century afterwards, Arabia is at Grenada on this hand, at Delhi on that."
Social Studies,"He's speaking of within 100 years of Mohammed's death, the Muslim empire has spread from what would eventually be Southern Spain, all the was to Northern India. These Arabs, the man Mahomet, and that one century, is it not as if a spark had fallen, one spark, on a world of what seemed black unnoticeable sand; but lo, the sand proves explosive powder, blazes heaven high from Delhi to Grenada."
Social Studies,"I said, the Great Man was always as lightning out of Heaven; the rest of men waited for him like fuel, and then they too would flame. And Thomas Carlyle is known as one of the proponents of the of Great Man view of history, that history is nothing but the story of a series of great men, who changed the direction in which humanity travels."
Social Studies,"So, what we're gonna do in this video is think about whether it really is all about a great man, or were there other things that were in the context of the time and space in which these things occur. This is what the world looked like in the year 600. Mohammed starts spreading his revelations in 610, and so you can see on this map, there's two major powers: the Byzantine, which is the Eastern Roman Empire, the vestiges of the Roman Empire, and you also have the Sassanid Persian Empire."
Social Studies,"The Byzantines are a Christian empire, and the Sassanids are Zoroastrian, and Mohammed is from the Quraysh tribe, which is in charge of Mecca, which is considered a pilgrimage site for the various tribes of Arabia. But, you can see that Arabia is fragmented, and this doesn't even do justice to how fragmented it was."
Social Studies,"But, if you fast forward 200 years, you see a major change, and in fact, you wouldn't have to go all the way to 800, even by the early eighth century, you see that Islam has spread from the Iberian peninsula all the way to the Indus, and most of this, as mentioned, happens within 100 years after Mohammed's death."
Social Studies,"But, let's ask our central question: why did Islam emerge so rapidly where and when it did? And there's no clear right or wrong answer here, it's all going to be conjecture, but that's what's fun about history, we can think about what we think we know, and then we can debate, and think about are there some patterns here that we see over and over in history? Well, what's the context? So, we know for a fact that Arabia was fragmented, that the law of the land in Arabia was tribal, and tribal justice, and this is the world that Mohammed grew up in."
Social Studies,"The various tribes often worshiping different gods. We also know at this time that Mohammed had exposure to other religions, some of which had penetrated the various tribes of Arabia. Most notably, you have Christianity, and Mohammed's wife's cousin was, in fact, a Christian. And you also have Judaism. These two clearly being related religions, Christianity coming out of a Jewish tradition."
Social Studies,"We also know that the two great empires here, the Byzantines and Persian empires are in constant conflict, and in fact, the Arabs and many in the Middle East are the pawns in that conflict. And so, you have the Byzantines versus the Persians, with the possibility of those living in their lands might not have been happy with either. There's also the sense that we're at the very beginning of a long decline for the Byzantine Empire."
Social Studies,"So, one thesis could be that Mohammed was able to bring many of the ideas of Christianity and Judaism, but these ideas helped to unify a fragmented Arab people. And not only did it unify them, but it gave them the energy that you could have through religious zeal, and that energy is what allowed them not only to unify in Arabia, and they're able to unify most of Arabia by the time of Mohammed's death."
Social Studies,"But, within 100 years of his death, they're able to take over the entire Sassanid Empire and make major inroads into the Byzantine Empire. And so, one argument might be, and I encourage you to argue with me, that they were unified, they had this missionary zeal, which perhaps was only seen in Christianity before Islam, and they were able to take advantage of conflict and discontent between the Byzantines and Persians in order to spread."
Social Studies,"Now, another question is do we see any patterns here? Are there any other examples in history of this happening? Well, the most comparable religion is Christianity, which is, today, larger than Islam, but Christianity, you have a long period between Jesus, who is the central figure of Christianity, who is the underlying spiritual figure, and when Christianity really spreads, and really becomes and empire, and that really starts with Constantine, roughly 300 years after the time of Jesus."
Social Studies,"What's interesting about the example in this video, the example of Islam, in terms of the religion, Mohammed plays a little bit of both of these roles. He is a spiritual figure, he has revelations, but he is also the founder of an empire, he also governs, he is also a military and political figure. And so, perhaps for the first time in history on this scale, you have the combination of religious zeal, of spiritual belief, of faith, combined with governance, combined with the desire to create an empire."
Social Studies,"In terms of empire, the only thing that might be comparable in terms of the vastness and the speed in which it happens, is the Mongol empire, the Mongols are an example of people who were fragmented initially, tribal, unified by Genghis Khan, and through that unification were able to spread incredibly rapidly, and take on some long historic and possibly declining empires. So, I'll leave you there, it's a fascinating question that historians debate to this day."
Social Studies,"Islam started awfully fast, and spread awfully fast. Why did this happen? Was it some unique characteristics of Mohammed? Was it some unique characteristics of the religion? Or, as Thomas Carlyle alludes to, maybe this whole region was just waiting for something like this, something to unify the tribes of Arabia and take on the decaying Byzantine and Sassanid empires.."
Social Studies,"Now what we see here in this dark brown is what was in control of this Muslim community at the time of Mohammed's death. You see even by that period they had control of a good chunk of the Arabian Peninsula. What's particularly surprising is how fast Islam spread shortly after that. The next period, after Mohammed dies, the leadership of the community, of the ummah, goes to the kalifs, and this actually becomes a contentious issue that we'll talk about in other videos."
Social Studies,"It's the seed of the eventual schism between the Sunis and the Shias. But this next period, the Rashidun, or the Rightly Guided Kalifs, kalif means successors, essentially successors to Mohammed, under these four kalifs, you see Islam spread from as far west as Tunesia and Egypt, all the way through Persia."
Social Studies,"Keep in mind, this is spreading, overtaking, conquering, what used to be controlled by very powerful empires, the Byzantine Empire, or Eastern Roman Empire, taking territory from them here, and then Sasanid Persia, taking territory from them. This is less than 30 years. Then it spreads even more."
Social Studies,"During the next caliphate, which is now dynastic, the Umayyad Caliphate, by the end of that at 750 CE, you see Islam has now spread or conquered from modern-day Spain and Portugal, all the way to modern-day India and Pakistan. We could continue this narrative, and we will continue to talk about it in future videos. But what's really interesting is to think about how and why it was able to spread this rapidly. There's few instances in history where we see this type of an empire form this quickly."
Social Studies,"To get some context on that, we have this text here from the American historian Ira Lapidus' book Islamic Societies to the Nineteenth Century. Ira Lapidus writes, ""The expansion of Islam ""involved different factors in different regions."
Social Studies,"""In North Africa, Anatolia, the Balkans, and India,"" so these are regions that we aren't showing on this map, those happened later on outside of the period depicted in this map, ""it was carried out by nomadic Arab or Turkish conquerors."" That is a similar form, method that we're talking about though in this map. ""In the Indian Ocean and West Africa, ""it spread by peaceful contacts among merchants ""or through the preaching of missionaries."
Social Studies,"""In some cases, the diffusion of Islam ""depended on its adoption by local ruling families. ""In others, it appealed to urban classes of the population, ""or tribal communities. ""The question of why people convert to Islam ""has always generated intense feeling."
Social Studies,"""Earlier generations of European scholars ""believed that conversion to Islam ""were made by the point of the sword, ""and that conquered people's were given the choice ""of conversion or death."" So according to Ira Lapidus, these early European scholars viewed it analogous to things like the Spanish Inquisition, or some aspects of the Crusades, or some of what we saw in the New World with the conquistadors, where it really was convert or die."
Social Studies,"But according to Lapidus, ""It is now apparent that conversion by force, ""while not unknown in Muslim countries,"" so there was some forced conversion, but according to Lapidus was, in fact, rare, ""Muslim conquerors ordinarily wished to dominate ""rather than convert, and most conversions ""to Islam were voluntary. ""In most cases, worldly and spiritual motives ""for conversion blended together."" Other sources I've looked at do hint at these early caliphates weren't that interested in conversion."
Social Studies,"They were clearly Muslim, and they were also Arab dominated, and they liked having this elite Arab Muslim ruling class and they weren't that interested in spreading their religion. Only when we get into the Abbasid Caliphate, where it becomes more multicultural and more Muslim and less Arab focused, that you start to have more and more conversions."
Social Studies,"The sources I've seen have, by the end of the Omayyad dynasty, only about 10%-30% of the conquered people convert to Islam, but much more convert during what's often referred to as the Golden Age of Islam, when Islam is collecting the works of the ancient Greeks, and the Chinese, and the Hindus, and getting scholars from all around the world under the Abbasid dynasty."
Social Studies,"Now, when Lapidus talks about in most cases worldly and spiritual motives for conversion blended together, he's referring to these ideas that maybe for some people it just appealed to them. You have to remember, people weren't going from being independent to being subjugated in most cases. Even before the conquest of Islam, they were probably subjugated by a king or part of an empire like the Byzantine Empire or the Persian Empire."
Social Studies,"So they're really switching from one conqueror to another, and oftentimes people are hopeful that the new conqueror might be better than the last. Oftentimes they're proven wrong. Sometimes it might actually be the case. There might have been some support that allowed it to spread this quickly. There's also worldly motives. If there's a Muslim ruling class, and if you want to be associated with that ruling class, that might be a worldly motivation in order to actually convert."
Social Studies,"Now the other thing that we do know about these early Muslim empires, and many of the Muslim empires, is they did have this notion of dhimmi status. Dhimmi is referring to the idea of protected persons. It's often referred to as people of the book, but it included Jews, Christians, that Islam, according to Islamic tradition follows in the same tradition of."
Social Studies,"But then when you eventually have Muslim conquest of India included Hindus and Buddists as well, and it also included Zoroastrians, who the early Muslims considered to be monotheistic. The idea of dhimmi status is that they would have protected rights, they would have the same property contract rights, but different political rights. The Muslim ruling class definitely had better political rights. They would pay a different tax than what the Muslims actually paid."
Social Studies,"Now in order to get context from a religious point of view, you can look at some of the religious texts of Islam, especially the Koran, and even the Hadith, which are the secondhand accounts of the life and practices of Mohammed. There you get an interesting perspective. On the side of religious tolerance, you have excerpts like this."
Social Studies,"""There shall be no compulsion ""in acceptance of the religion."" ""Unto you your religion and unto my religion."" From and ethnic point of view, there also seems to be a sense of nonsuperiority of one ethnicity over another. ""Indeed, there is no superiority ""of an Arab over a non-Arab, nor of a non-Arab over an Arab, ""nor or a white over a black, nor a black over a white, ""except by piety towards God."" This is from Mohammed's farewell sermon. This is given by the Hadith, The Life and Sayings of Mohammed."
Social Studies,"Now on the other hand, there definitely are more militant portions of the Koran. One of the most quoted excerpts is this one. ""And fight in the way of God those who fight you, ""but transgress not the limits. ""Truly God likes not the transgressors. ""And kill them wherever you overtake them ""and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, ""and persecution is worse than killing. ""And do not fight them at the sacred mosque ""until they fight you there. ""But if they fight you, then kill them."
Social Studies,"""Such is the recompense of the disbelievers. ""And if they cease, then indeed ""God is forgiving and merciful. ""Fight them until there is no persecution ""and until worship is acknowledged to be for God. ""But if they cease, then there is to be ""no aggression except against the oppressors."" So a critical view of this is saying, look, this is clearly advocating to kill other people, and fight those who are considered to be disbelievers. That's clearly a critical view of this."
Social Studies,"You will not see this type of language, for example, in more pacifist notions of, say, the Gospels. It's definitely not the modern notion that we have of passive resistance, or peaceful resistance, and the notion of a Gandhi or a Martin Luther King. Now those who would defend or see a little bit more nuance here, would say, look, you've got to, this is not talking about killing disbelievers arbitrarily. This is talking about killing those who are persecuting you."
Social Studies,"They would say, look, this revelation is believed, according to Islamic tradition, to have come down when the Muslims were actively being persecuted by Mohammed's tribe, the Quraysh. They were in Medina. They were essentially in exile. They were in fear for their lives, Mohammed's own life. The Quraysh had attempted to kill him. They were torturing and killing that early Muslim community."
Social Studies,"In that context they're saying, ""And fight the way of God those who fight you."" So it's really out of defense, trying not to be persecuted. ""But transgress not the limits."" Even there there are rules of law here, or rules of engagement. ""And kill them wherever you overtake them ""and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, ""and persecution is worse than killing."" So this is creating a moral hierarchy that is very debatable, especially in modern times."
Social Studies,"Is persecution worse than killing? ""And do not fight them at the sacred mosque."" This really seems to be referring to the Quraysh, because remember they're fighting over this notion of what even should happen at the sacred mosque. ""Until they fight you there. ""But if they fight you, then kill them. ""Such is the recompense for the disbelievers."
Social Studies,"""And if they cease, then indeed God ""is forgiving and merciful."" So to some degree, those who would see the nuance in this passage, they say, hey look, this is talking about killing those who persecute you, but it actually seems to be a little bit more conciliatory. Remember, the Koran is, according to Islamic tradition, built on the traditions of the Old Testament and on Christian traditions."
Social Studies,"Especially relative to the Old Testament, which tends to be much more absolute when someone is disliked by God, whole cities or peoples are destroyed or killed, or God might command his prophets and the leadership to kill other people just because they disbelieve God in the Old Testament. People who would defend this passage or see nuance here says, look, this is about being persecuted and fighting persecution, and if those persecutors stop then don't seek revenge."
Social Studies,"""And if they cease then indeed God ""is forgiving and merciful. ""And there is to be no aggression ""except against the oppressors."" I'll leave it to you to decide. I encourage you to look up your own primary resources. Look up different translations. One of the tricky things of not just the Koran, but including the Bible, which is believed to first be written in Aramaic, or the Old Testament, the Torah, written in Hebrew, is that the translation itself can also give you various nuance."
Social Studies,"But make your own decisions about what you think is, or your own judgments of what we've talked about in this video.."
Social Studies,"Where are we and when are we right now? - [Eman] So we are around the early seventh century, - [David] Okay - [Eman] And here we see the Byzantine empire, which, at the time was still a continuation of Rome, so this is like the eastern roman empire, - [David] Right. - [Eman] and it's an aging empire and we also have Sassanid Persia which started in the third century and is still continuing into this period. - [David] Right, so we've got on the timeline it's going beyond our start point here. - [Eman] Yep."
Social Studies,"So these are two very powerful empires who often are in tension with one another. As you can see they neighbor each other. And around this time they're involved in some pretty powerful struggles here. - [David] Right. So in 628 it leads to a lot of instability within Sassanid Persia. - [Eman] Certainly, and in some ways as well the Byzantines are weakened by how many resources they've exhausted in these tensions. So around this time, a new religion emerges."
Social Studies,"Muhammad is born in Arabia, and pretty soon during his lifetime and immediately after his lifetime, the religion of Islam spreads rapidly through Islamic conquests, which Saul talked about in an earlier video. - [David] I mean, just to give you an impression, Muhammad died in the year 633? - [Eman] Yes. - [David] So by 750, this is what the state of the Islamic world looked like."
Social Studies,"- [Eman] They took over most of Persia and a large part of the Byzantine empire, as we can see and then even beyond, it goes further east, further west, all the way over to Spain. And this happens really really quickly, but it's not the case that Islamic culture necessarily takes in all of these areas that quickly. So it takes a little bit longer for that to really take hold, and it also takes hold in areas far beyond this empire as well."
Social Studies,"So certainly the presence of Islamic or Muslim rulers in these areas certainly did affect the culture of these places. But what's more important is sort of the ways in which Islam slowly integrated with some of these cultures. And that happened through trade, through missionaries, and also through pilgramage routes that happened, emanating out from Mecca. And these religious ideas weren't static."
Social Studies,"As they moved through different areas and as they moved through different routes, they changed and they started to take the shape of the local culture and the local flavor as well. - [David] So let me pull up some trade routes. These were the active trade routes of the period. And you can see this is a continuation of the silk road. It goes all the way from Rome to China. This is Xian, which was then known as Chang'an. This is the imperial capital of at least ten different Chinese dynasties."
Social Studies,"There's also a very large mosque here. - [Eman] So here we have the great mosque at Xian, and what's really interesting about this mosque is that it really fuses a lot of Islamic and Chinese ideas. So for example, it still sort of has the structure of an imperial building, and the way that the courtyards are set up. - [David] Sure. - [Eman] But instead of following sort of the rules of Feng Shui, it is oriented towards Mecca, which is the direction in which Muslims look when they pray."
Social Studies,"But it still has a very Chinese character. - [David] Right. - [Eman] And this makes sense because these trade routes basically had to go through the Islamic empire. And so as people traveled, so did ideas. And those ideas transformed along the way. - [David] What's next on our whistle stop tour, Eman? - [Eman] Let's look at the mosque in Djenne. - [David] Okay. So Djenne is in what is today, Mali, just south of Timbuktu or Tombuktu as it's called today. So it was a great center of Islamic learning."
Social Studies,"And in Djenne is the site of the world's largest mud brick building, the grand mosque of Djenne. Let me pull it up. It's a really incredible building that gets a lot of elements of Malian culture. So this is the grand mosque of Djenne, this is a mud brick building. We have an article about this on Khan Academy in the art history section. What's really cool to me about the grand mosque of Djenne is the way that is incorporates Malian traditions into Islamic tradition."
Social Studies,"So you can see on top of these spires, some of these spires are minarets, from which issue the call to prayer. You can't see them as detailed, but there are little ostrich eggs on top of - [Eman] Ostrich eggs? - [David] Yeah, in Mali, ostrich eggs represent purity and fertility. And so even within the constraints of building a religious building, there's still expressions of local culture."
Social Studies,"- [Eman] Yeah, and it's really interesting how that spread through trade, but it also spread another way, which is through pilgramage, through missionaries, through preachers, and that also took on the local traditions in interesting ways. So let's go to southern, to South India. - [David] Okay. - [Eman] Near Kerala. - [David] So this is the Cheraman Juma mosque. This is supposed to be one of the earliest mosques in history. It's construction dates to about 630. - [Eman] Yep, 629 to be precise."
Social Studies,"- [David] Thank you. - [Eman] This was actually during the life of the prophet, and it's quite far from Mecca, so it's really fascinating how quickly it traveled there. But it traveled with a preacher and as you can see, this is a very distinctly Indian mosque. Another way that Islam traveled through preachers was through Sufis. So let's talk about Sufis for just a minute. - [David] Sure."
Social Studies,"- [Eman] Sufis were like a mystical devotional practice, and we see many iterations of Sufism in all different sects of Islam. But they were particularly successful at spreading Islam for a few reasons. One of them was that they adapted the teachings to local traditions. And another reason was that they built lodges and places of worship along the way. And these sometimes function like community centers and monasteries. So let's have a look at a couple of them. - [David] Sure."
Social Studies,"- [Eman] Let's look at some North African ones. - [David] So this is a Ribat in Tunisia. - [Eman] Yes, so a Ribat is kind of like a hostel, you have travelers staying there. Early on in their history, there were soldiers that stayed there. Over time, they sort of took on a monastery culture for Sufis. We also have something called a Zawiya. So here is an example of one. And similarly this was a place of learning, it was a place of worship."
Social Studies,"People often lived there for a long time, so they sort of have this monastic tradition that created a permanent presence for Islam along these routes. And this was really really integral in the spread of Islam. And it's not just in North Africa, but even farther east, you see different iterations of that. So once you get into former Persian territory and in Indian territory you have something called a Hanka. So here's an example from Kashmir. This is called the Shah Hamdan mosque."
Social Studies,"And it's a fourteenth century mosque. And this is a commemorative building, it commemorates an important Sufi leader. But again, you see some of the local flavor here. You see that there's some intricate wood carvings, which is really, - [David] Very Kashmir-y - [Eman] Very Kashmir-y, certainly. And similarly this was a place of worship but also a place where people passed through and interacted and learned. So it was a site of spreading Islamic tradition as well."
Social Studies,"- [David] So that was about, sorry I should have said, that was about here in Srinagar. - [Eman] Yes, about there. - [David] Yeah and so, in this way Islam was also spread. - [Eman] Certainly. Let's have a look at sort of the bounds of the Islamic empire. - [David] Sure. - [Eman] And where we see some of these instances of new Islamic traditions were no longer in the heart of the Islamic empire. We're beyond that. And that's because Islam was carried in many different ways."
Social Studies,And as we can see it ended up with some really really diverse iterations of Islam..
Social Studies,"or 1.6 billion Muslims are Sunni, and roughly 10% are Shia. And that 10% is concentrated mainly in places like Iran, Iraq, but they are spread throughout the Muslim world or the world in general. Now, the word Sunni comes from the word Sunnah which is referring to examples of Muhammad. The word Shia comes from shi'atu 'Ali which means followers of Ali or party of Ali, and we'll talk more about Ali in a little bit."
Social Studies,"But, the general division is over who should succeed Muhammad after his death as the leader of the Muslim community. Shias believe it should be members of Muhammad's family and especially descendants of Muhammad, while the Sunnis believe that it doesn't necessarily have to be that. But, as we'll see, this division becomes stronger and stronger and stronger as there's more and more bloodshed between the two parties."
Social Studies,"Because so much of this revolves around the family of Muhammad, let's just review that first and then we'll talk about the division over who should succeed Muhammad as caliph or successor to lead the Muslim community. So, you see Muhammad right over here born 570. We have his birth on our timeline as well. And just to read this timeline, it goes from light blue to dark blue when Muhammad, according to Islamic tradition, starts to have the revelations from God."
Social Studies,"And the Muslim calendar starts at 622, the time of the Hijrah where the Muslim community, in order to escape persecution from the Quraysh, migrate from Mecca to Medina. Now, we've talked about several of these figures in other videos. Right over here, you have Muhammad's dad, Adbullah, who dies several months before Muhammad is born. You have Aminah here who is Muhammad's mother, and she dies when Muhammad is six years old."
Social Studies,"Then, you have Abdul-Muttalib who is the head of Muhammad's, you could say, household and he takes custody after the death of Aminah. And he takes custody until Muhammad is eight years old when Abdul-Muttalib dies, and then Muhammad's uncle, Abu Talib, takes custody. It's under Abu Talib that Muhammad learns his trade as a merchant and as a trader."
Social Studies,"Now, later on, we talk about Khadijah who is a wealthy widow in Mecca, and she employs Muhammad and according to Islamic tradition, is impressed by him and proposes to him, and she's 15 years older than Muhammad. This is her third marriage, and Muhammad marries her. She's a significant figure in Islam, not because she is Muhammad's first wife, but also because she is the first Muslim."
Social Studies,"Now, as you can see, Muhammad and Khadijah, they have several children, and I list one of them here, Fatimah, because Fatimah ends up marrying Abu Talib's son, Ali. And Ali is the Ali that we're talking about where the word Shia, shi'atu 'Ali comes from, party of Ali. Because Ali is considered the second Muslim. He is one of the early followers of Muhammad. As you can see, he is Muhammad's cousin. He grows up in the same household with Muhammad with Abu Talib, and he is also Muhammad's son-in-law."
Social Studies,"He marries Fatimah and they have several children, two of which are Hassan and Hussein who figure very prominently in the narrative I'm going to talk about in this video and the next. Now, the other figures that you see here, you have Abu Bakr who was a close companion of Muhammad, also one of the early Muslims. And you can see he was a little bit younger than Muhammad. And they are connected through Aisha."
Social Studies,"Muhammad marries Aisha after the death of Khadijah, and Aisha is a significant figure in early Islam. She's considered to have a very strong personality. Many of the Hadith are narrated by her. The Hadith are the Muslim traditions and accounts of Muhammad's life, and it's a significant part of the religion outside of the Quran. And she is married to Muhammad at a very, very young age, and there's some debate about how young she actually was."
Social Studies,"But, as we'll see, she also figures prominently in this narrative and in this schism that develops between the Sunni and the Shia. And the Sunni and the Shia view her differently. So, let's go back to the timeline here. So, as Muhammad's life nears its end in 632, in previous videos, we talk about his final pilgrimage to Mecca. And then, on his way back to Medina, at a place like Ghadir Khumm, he gives a sermon, a sermon that is especially very important to the Shia. According to that short sermon."
Social Studies,"And Ghadir Khumm, Ghadir literally means pond or small stream, so it's the sermon at the pond Khumm. There's one quotation that Shia consider to be very, very important where Muhammad says ""Of whomsoever I had been Mawla."" Ali here is to be his Mawla. And the word Mawla means protector or leader, or it could mean guardian or people that you are close to. And the Shia view this as clear evidence that Muhammad intended Ali to be his successor."
Social Studies,"Many members of the Sunni tradition take a slightly different interpretation where they say Mawla doesn't necessarily have to mean protector or leader. It could mean companion or friend or member that is close to, and so they don't view this as strongly of evidence. But, in the Shia tradition, the event at Ghadir Khumm is actually a significant event and it is even a holiday. So, that's the evidence that Shia point to as why Ali should be the successor."
Social Studies,"But, then Muhammad dies, and according to the tradition, while his funeral was being planned by his family, the close companions were meeting and discussing who should succeed Muhammad. And the close companions decide that is should be Abu Bakr. So, Abu Bakr becomes the first caliph, and he rules for two years. He's succeeded by Umar, sometimes pronounced as Omar, who then is assassinated who is succeeded by Uthman, sometimes pronounced as Osman who is then assassinated. And then, Ali takes power."
Social Studies,"According to Sunni tradition, these first four caliphs are considered the Rashidun caliphs or the rightly guided. And under their rule, you have the significant spread of what becomes this Islamic empire that we talk about in other videos. In Shia tradition, they consider these first three caliphs as usurpers. They believe that Ali should have been caliph from the beginning right in 632 at the time of Muhammad's death."
Social Studies,"And once again, they cite the events at Ghadir Khumm which was observed according to the Hadith by thousands of people and there's many, many accounts of this. Now, Ali is in power, but as we will see in the next video, this starts the first civil war, the first Muslim civil war, often referred to as the First Fitna, between Ali and the Umayyad's who are the family of Uthman, and we will cover that in the next video.."
Social Studies,"Because Uthman has a fellow member of the Umayyad clan, the Umayyad clan, they're also Quraysh, just like Mohammed's clan, the Hashem are also Quraysh, and Uthman's family member, Muawiya was has-been governor of Damascus since the time of the caliph Umar, and when Uthman is assassinated, Muawiya is not happy, and when Ali comes to power, he thinks that Ali is not making a solid effort to put the assassins to justice."
Social Studies,"And he refuses to pledge his allegiance to Ali as the caliph, now the other context here is that Muawiya has already built a significant military force, and that force is becoming stronger and stronger and stronger, and so this leads to a lot of tension. Muawiya wants Ali to bring the assassins of Uthman to justice, and Ali wants Muawiya to pledge allegiance to him, who is now caliph."
Social Studies,"Now just for a little bit extra context, Ali also decides to move the capital of the caliphate to Kufa, which is in modern day Iraq. Now things are getting increasingly tense and this is where we have Aisha entering into the picture, and we talk about Aisha in the previous video, she is one of Mohammed's wives, married at a very young age, and she is considered a very strong figure in early Islam."
Social Studies,"So she leads a delegation, really an army, in order to convince Ali to bring the assassins of Uthman to justice."
Social Studies,"The meet in Basra, once again in modern day Iraq, and while they're talking about, or negotiating what Ali needs to do, some of Ali's followers, as the narrative goes, were a little bit more extreme and really didn't want a peace brokered between Muawiya and Ali, and so they attack, and that's what leads to what is known as the Battle of the Camel, which is depicted here, named after Aisha's camel, and it becomes a very bloody battle. Aisha is really one of the leaders in this battle."
Social Studies,"Once again, you can imagine, a very very strong figure in early Islam, but Ali's forces are victorious, and they send Aisha back home and then she goes into something of a political retirement, and it is somewhat inconclusive."
Social Studies,"But then that leads later on to what is known as the Battle of Siffin, the Battle of the Camel was in 656, the Battle of Siffin is in 657, and in this situation, you once again have a delegation, or really an army on the side of Ali meeting an army directly now with Muawiya at Siffin."
Social Studies,"And once again, they are not fighting for roughly 100 days, they want to negotiate something, but some of the more ardent followers of Ali don't want any form of peace with Muawiya, so they attack Muawiya's army and you have a very bloody battle that ensues. Now both sides don't want all of this bloodshed in this burgeoning Muslim community, so they decide to let it be decided to arbitration."
Social Studies,"Now the arbitration, according to the accounts that I've looked at, say that they decided that neither Ali or Muawiya should be caliph and that it should be an election from the Muslim community."
Social Studies,"Now Ali refuses this, and what's interesting about this is the accounts I've seen is that those same zealous folks who you could say instigated the Battle of Siffin and the Battle of the Camel during this Muslim civil war, they're no longer trusting Ali that he can protect them, that he is the strong leader they need, and so they are the ones that then decide to assassinate, and are successful in assassinating Ali."
Social Studies,"So after the assassination of Ali, his son, Hassan, comes to power, officially as the caliph based in Kufa, but remember, you have this very powerful leader in Muawiya with a very significant military, leading or in control of the Levant and the governor of Syria."
Social Studies,"And so they enter into a treaty, clearly Hassan sees the writing on the wall, he can't really fight Muawiya by force, he really doesn't have strong control really much further than this region around Kufa, so he gets into a treaty with Muawiya where he gives control of the caliphate to Muawiya, and according to that treaty, as long as Muawiya allows the next caliph after his death to be based on some form of an election, let the Islamic world choose the successor afterwards."
Social Studies,"But then later Hassan, he goes into something of a retirement, he dies in his mid 40s, and some accounts say that he was assassinated, poisoned by his wife, maybe due to the Umayyads who didn't want him around, and then in 680, Muawiya dies. Now according to the treaty between Muawiya and Hassan, it should have been some form of an election there, but Muawiya says, or before his death, he makes Yazid the successor."
Social Studies,"And so Hussein, who is another son of Ali, Hassan's younger brother, and by this point Hassan is dead, he says hey, this is a breach of the treaty, and does not pledge his allegiance to Yazid."
Social Studies,"But there is a group in Kufa who say hey, we will support you, and so Hussein goes to Kufa but on the way there, and he is with his family, when Yazid catches wind of this, he sends an army to stop them, and Yazid's interest is essentially to eliminate Hussein and his family so that you don't have any other legitimate claimants to the caliphate, especially because, remember, Hussein is a living descendant of Mohammed."
Social Studies,"And so you then have this event where Yazid's forces intercept Hussein's caravan in Karbala, and this is known in the Shia tradition as the Tragedy of Karbala, because at Karbala, you have Hussein's family gets massacred."
Social Studies,"There is an account that his six month old son is beheaded and killed along with Hussein, and so this becomes he defining event of the Shia tradition, the tragedy of Karbala, we've already taught their belief that Ali should have been the caliph from the beginning, but now you have Yazid, proported caliph, who murders, who kills off, according to Shia tradition, a significant member of Mohammed's family and does this in bloody, bloody fashion."
Social Studies,"And so even to this day, a significant part of the Shia tradition is mourning what happens at the Battle of Karbala, and this is not a part of the Sunni tradition, the Sunni tradition views this as a tragedy, as an unfortunate event, but they do not view this as a significant part of their theology, and also as part of Shia tradition and theology, Battle of Karbala is the determining event, the thing that Shias mourn in their religious faith, and they also believe that the leadership of the community should be by imams who are descendant of Mohammed, which is not believed by the Sunnis.."
Social Studies,"And they also began to collect the knowledge from within the empire and from the peoples that they encountered on the borders of the empire including the Indians, and the Chinese. And they did this throughout the Umayyad dynasty. But it really came to its full fruition during the Abbasid Caliphate. Now the Abbasid Caliphate, one of the first things they did under the Calph al-Mansur is build Baghdad and move the capital of the empire to Baghdad."
Social Studies,"Now one of al-Mansur's successors al-Rashid, is famous for making Baghdad a center of learning. According to the historian John William Draper this is a sense of what life was like under al-Rashid's rule. During the period of the Calphs the learned men of the Christians and the Jews were not only held in great esteem, but were appointed to posts of great responsibilities and were promoted to the higher ranking jobs in the government."
Social Studies,"He, Calph Haroon Rasheed, never considered to which country alerted person belonged nor his faith in belief but only his excellence in the field of learning. And to get a sense of how much learning and how advanced the knowledge began to be especially under the rulership of al-Rashid, during this time he was a contemporary of Charlemagne who was the Frankish king. He was also the first holy Roman emperor. And so it's this region right over here."
Social Studies,"And they were trading gifts and this is a historical account Haroon al-Rashid sends Charlemagne this water clock. And it's so foreign to the Francs to Charlemagne, that he thinks that it's it must be some type of magic. That it can't be explained by just normal means. And then things really get invested in terms of collecting knowledge as we get into the rule of al-Rashid's son al-Ma'mun where he creates in Baghdad what is called The House of Wisdom."
Social Studies,"Which is this center of learning, of mathematics, astronomy, physics, medicine, geography, and map making, poetry, philosophy. And, over the next several hundred years these Abbasid Caliphs are going to sponsor scholars from India, learn it in Sanskrit and the ancient Sanskrit text in Greek, Chinese, Persian to translate as much of the knowledge and to collect it in libraries in cities, like Baghdad. To translate it into Arabic, and to collect all of that knowledge in one place."
Social Studies,"And just to get a sense of the type of advances that occurred during this golden age of Islam which correlates strongly, or is essentially during the Abbasid dynasty and it ends with the Mongol invasion in the middle of the 13th century right over here. There are scientists like Al-Kwarizmi. And Al-Kwarizmi is a Persian mathematician and physicist. And he's famous for being the father of algebra."
Social Studies,"The word algebra that we now have today the subject you can learn a lot about on Khan Academy it comes from the Arabic word al-jabr and his book al-Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wal-muqabala which literally means, and those of you who might speak Arabic, or Persian, or even Hindi or who might recognize Kitab as book. And then hisab is calculation."
Social Studies,And al-jabr is an operation of completion and it's essentially it's one of the operations we now do in algebra where you're doing the same thing to both sides of the equation Balancing is also a very similar operation. He also brought the Indian number system or the Hindu numerals. He brought them to the Islamic empire. And that was really the bridge to bringing it to the west.
Social Studies,"Famously Pope Sylvester the second he was educated in Catalonia with the point of acquiring knowledge that was gained from the Arabs. Remember, the Arabs were in control over the Islamic empires. It was not the Abbasids it was actually the remnants of the Umayyads who were in control of Spain at the time. But because of that, this area was considered a center of learning."
Social Studies,"And Pope Sylvester, who got his education there, he's the one that is often given credit for being one of the first to introduce the decimal numeral system. This Hindu Arabic decimal system that we now use for our numeric system as opposed to something like Roman Numerals. Well another very interesting thing is not only the word algebra comes from al-jabr but the word algorithm is literally comes from his name. The name Al-Kwarizmi, Al-Kwarizmi in Latin they pronounce as algarithme."
Social Studies,"So other significant contributors to the science of all of human civilization are people like al-Marwazi. Al-Marwazi, once again, in Baghdad. And he would have been a contemporary of al-Kwarizmi. And he, if you've ever taken trigonometry, or if you're about to take trigonometry, he is accredited with coming up with the core trigonometric functions. We're talking about sine, cosine."
Social Studies,"Tangent and cotangent it might have been Marwazi or it might have been another mathematician named al-Buzjani who came a little bit after, or a lot depending on a human scale, but was also based in Baghdad. And together, they came up with the six the six trigonometric functions. They weren't contemporaries of each other but they both made significant contributions to what we now call trigonometry. Including many of the trigonometric identities that we now learn in high school."
Social Studies,"Now you also have physicists, mathematicians, astronomers, like Alhazon. And he is credited as getting one of the more sophisticated views of how light and vision works. These are some quotes from Alhazon. From each point of every color body illuminated by any light issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point. This is a fairly sophisticated view of how light actually works."
Social Studies,"And he's also credited with using and understanding the scientific method several hundred years before the Renaissance in Europe. The duty of a man, the duty of the man who investigates the writing of scientists. If learning the truth is his goal is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads and attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency."
Social Studies,"And now another very famous poet philosopher mathematician poly math of the time was Omar Khayyan. And in the west, he's most famous for his poetry. Most famously the work of the Rubaiyat the translation by Fitzgerald. But he was also a significant philosopher mathematician. This is a picture of some of his work right over here. You can see that he did his work in the 11th and the 12th centuries. And he did it from (mumbling). But he investigated Pascal's Triangle and the binomial theorem."
Social Studies,"And keep in mind, this was over 500 years before Pascal. So maybe it should actually be called Khayyam's Triangle. And just to get a sense of his poetry, or a sense of the (mumbling) in general, which I encourage you to look up and read. And this is at least Fitzgerald's translation of it. And that inverted bowl we call the sky where under crawling cooped we live and die. Lift not they hands to it for help for it rolls impotently on as thou or I."
Social Studies,"So as you can imagine, this Islamic world these empires between the eighth and 13th centuries, it was actually a very powerful bridge of human knowledge taking knowledge from the Indians, the Chinese, the Ancient Greeks, and providing a bridge during the Dark Ages in Europe. And get a sense of that, we have some text from some historians on that time period. This is some text from this is some text from the historian Phillip Hiti."
Social Studies,"And he wrote, During all the first part of the Middle Ages no other people made as important a contribution to human progress as did the Arabs. If we take this term to mean all those whose mother tongue was Arabic and not merely those living in the Arabian peninsula. For centuries, Arabic was a language of learning, culture, and intellectual progress for the whole of the civilized world with the exception of the Far East."
Social Studies,"From the ninth to the 12th century, there were more philosophical medical historical religious astronomical and geographical works written in Arabic than in any other human tongue. And we also have a frame, a point of view from Bertrand Russell in his History of Western Philosophy who wrote, Our use of the phrase the Dark Ages to cover the period from 699 to 1000 marks our undue concentration on Western Europe. In China, this period includes the time of the Tang dynasty, the greatest age of Chinese poetry."
Social Studies,"From India to Spain, the brilliant civilization of Islam flourished. What was lost to Christendom at this time was not lost to civilization, but quite the contrary. To us it seems that Western European civilization is civilization, but this is a narrow view.."
Social Studies,"we're talking about in the hundreds of followers. But in other videos, we talk about his apostles who start spreading the faith, not only to other Jews, but also to non-Jews, to gentiles. We talked about Emperor Nero and his famous purges of Christians, in particular, you have the famous Roman Fire, or The Fire of Rome in 64 C.E. that Nero blames on Christians, and he uses this to do significant purge in Rome. Many historians believe that the apostles Peter and Paul were killed during those purges."
Social Studies,"This is a painting of Nero using Christians lighting them alive to punish them for that fire. Now, other imperial acts that continue to have a significant effect on this very early Christian church. We talked about the destroying of the second temple in Jerusalem in 70 C.E., and that's under the reign of Vespasian. And this of course is a very significant event for the Jewish people, but it also has a significant effect on Christianity, because remember Christianity was really centered at Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"It was a sect of Christianity, or it was, it got its start as a sect of Christianity, but now, with the destruction of the temple, the Jews were dispersed from Jerusalem, and so were many of these early Christians. And so the centers of Christianity became throughout the empire, places like Antioch. And you continue to have a discomfort with Christians especially as they became more and more in number, and they started to have more and more power."
Social Studies,"And here you have these people who refused to obey the Roman gods, to do their rituals, to worship the Roman gods, and remember, even, there was emperor worship here. And the issue was more so than even the Jewish people, who, to a certain degree, kept to themselves, these Christians were missionaries. They were spreading their faith to Roman citizens. Families were being split apart, where some decided to become Christians and no longer follow these Roman practices."
Social Studies,"And so you have these various persecutions, and these various purges, and they get more and more significant as you go into the second and even to some degree in the third century as Christians become more and more prominent and more and more in number. Remember, they have this missionary zeal, and it really becomes a significant purge under the reign of Diocletian. In previous videos, we talk about Diocletian."
Social Studies,"He's the one that famously split the empire between east and west, but he's also famous for his purge of the Christians. The most extreme state-sponsored purges of Christians in the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"But what's interesting is right after, or shortly after those purges, we're talking a few decades here, the next empire that would, the next emperor who would have reign over the entire Roman Empire, would be Constantine, and at least relative to Christians, he would be the opposite of Diocletian, because as he's trying to consolidate his power in 312 C.E., you have the famous battle at the Milvian Bridge outside of, or entering into Rome."
Social Studies,"And in this battle, Constantine, he sees a vision of the Christian cross centered on the sun, and he thinks that that is a sign that he should fight under the cross. And he gets the symbols painted on his soldier's shield, and he's victorious. This date, 312, Milvian Bridge, The Battle at Milvian Bridge, is viewed as the beginning of Constantine's conversion to Christianity, viewing it as his chosen faith."
Social Studies,"In 313, the Roman emperor, or the empire, issues the edict of Milan, which officially makes Christianity OK. It legalizes Christianity, which is a big deal, because these folks have been persecuted all this time. They haven't been worshiping the Roman gods. Then in 325, Constantine goes even further, and he convenes the council of Nicea, where he brings the bishops from all of Christendom together, to start having a more unified belief system. They come up with a Nicean creed."
Social Studies,"A lot of the debate is whether Jesus, as son of God, should be considered equal to God or as God or a little less, as being the son, maybe if he is the son, maybe there was a time where there wasn't a son, and there was just God, but the Nicean Creed says no, they are one and the same, these two things are equivalent. And then Constantine, on his death bed, famously gets baptized, and becomes a Christian, the first Christian emperor of this gigantic Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"And so you can imagine, you have more and more followers of Christianity, but now, this is, so to speak, prime time. The emperor of the Roman, the emperor of the Roman Empire has converted to Christianity, and it's a legalized religion. And then that gets even more momentum when we get to the end of the fourth century."
Social Studies,"Emperor Theodosius, who is Christian, under him, it becomes the official religion of the Roman Empire, the same empire that at one point, Christianity was illegal, and it was being persecuted, now it was the official religion of the Roman Empire. Theodosius, I mention him in other videos, he was incidentally also the last emperor to rule over both Eastern and Western Roman Empires."
Social Studies,"So you have this empire that starts off very anti-Christian, actually in the beginning, they don't really take much note of what's going on in Judea and Galilee, but more and more, they start to persecute them. But we go a few hundred years into this, and it becomes a Christian empire.."
Social Studies,"As Constantine takes over, he becomes sympathetic to the Christians and he eventually becomes Christian himself. Even then, there was a lot of diversity within the Christian Church. There were debates about the nature of Jesus Christ relative to the Father, relative to the Holy Spirit. There were multiple sects of Christianity. And one in particular started to create a debate. There was a priest in Alexandria, which was one of the major cities of the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"Now remember, by this point, Rome of course is one of the most significant, if not the most significant city. Now Constantine sets up a capital at Byzantium, which will eventually be known as Constantinople. And Alexandria, which was originally founded by Alexander the Great, is also one of the significant cities of the Empire. And in Alexandria there is a Christian priest by the name of Arius, who has a view on Christ that becomes a bit of a controversy."
Social Studies,"And to understand that, here is an account of his writings, or his beliefs. So this is Arius of Alexandria. If the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows that He, the Son, had his substance from nothing. So, he's drawing a distinction between the essence of the Father and the Son, who's manifested as Jesus Christ."
Social Studies,"Now this is very controversial, because even his own bishop in Alexandria viewed the Father and the Son to be of the same substance. Now, today, you might say, hey, isn't this just word play? It feels like it's semantic, which is really debating around the meaning of words. But, at the end of the Roman Empire and as we get into the Middle Ages, this was a major issue of philosophical and it would sometimes bleed over into political debate."
Social Studies,"And so Constantine, who we mentioned has a sympathy towards the Christians, he allows Christianity to be tolerated, he does not like this idea of this debate and he wants to help unify the Christians. So, in 325 he calls the Council of Nicaea, to help resolve this controversy, which gets known as the Arian Controversy, named after Arius of Alexandria."
Social Studies,"Now it's worth mentioning, Arius wasn't the first person to make this argument, that the Father in some way was more divine than the Son, because He begat the Son, He existed before the Son. But this controversy really revolves around Arius, because he was especially persuasive about spreading this view of the relationship between the Father and the Son, manifested by Jesus."
Social Studies,"And at the Council of Nicaea, many of the bishops throughout Christendom are in attendance, it's known as the First Ecumenical Conference, the word ecumenical comes from the Greek word for the inhabited Earth. So you can view it as the Church leaders from the inhabited Earth, in order to create a consensus about what it means to be a Christian. And Arius of Alexandria was there to defend his position, but the majority of those there did not like his point of view."
Social Studies,"So they declared Arius' beliefs as heresy and they exile him. And to be very clear that they do not believe that the Son is of a different substance of the Father, they issue the Nicene Creed. So what I have here, this is known as the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed."
Social Studies,"And this is based on the Nicene Creed, which was established in 325, which was shorter, but then in 381, under Theodosius, you have your Second Ecumenical Council, which is held in Constantinople, to reaffirm some of the ideas of the Nicene Council. And so as I read this, keep a look out for some of these words, which were really put there to try to settle the Arian Controversy, to try to ensure that that type of belief does not surface again."
Social Studies,"We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, Begotten of the Father before all ages. So, not like Arius was arguing, that there was a time where the Father existed before the Son existed. Here it says begotten of the Father, but before all ages, so there was always a time when there was a Son."
Social Studies,"Light of Light, Very God of Very God, Begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by whom all things were made. So, once again, really addressing this Arian Controversy, the Arian Heresy as it becomes known, that the Father and the Son are of the same essence, one is not more divine than the other. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man."
Social Studies,"And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father. And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, Whose kingdom shall have no end. And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father."
Social Studies,"Now here in brackets I've written filoque and the son? Because even though the official Nicene- Constantinopolitan Creed just says Who proceeds from the Father, as we will see later on, as the Church starts to become more and more divided, in the West, in Latin, the term filoque gets added, which means and the son."
Social Studies,"And, once again, this is starting to address this notion of how does the Son relate to the Father? So, when you add filoque, you're saying, hey, the Holy Spirit is emanating from both the Father and the Son, versus just the Father, but we'll get into that. This was not a matter of debate in the 4th century, but it will become a matter of debate as we go into the 6th century and beyond. And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father."
Social Studies,"Who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, Who spoke by the Prophets. And we believe in one, holy, catholic, meaning universal, and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. We look for the Resurrection of the dead, and the life of the age to come, Amen. So this is interesting, because it's, you can view it as a unification of Christendom. Now, as we will see, that unification does not hold well over the next several hundred years."
Social Studies,"Even though Arius is exiled and he dies shortly thereafter, you continue to have sympathetic bishops and even Roman Emperors, to the Arian Doctrine. You also, this debate between the relation of the Father and the Son continues, we'll talk about this filoque debate. But maybe most important and the biggest cause of the eventual divisions between the Church, ones that carry on even to today, it's really about a power struggle."
Social Studies,"So, as we've been talking about the late Roman Empire and even the fall of the Western Empire and the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, you might already notice that there are several very powerful actors here. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, you have the Byzantine Emperor, who considers him, and as we'll see, also herself, the Roman Emperor. We have the Bishop, the Patriarch, or, often known, the Pope of Rome."
Social Studies,"Now Rome is significant, because according to tradition the Church at Rome was founded by the Apostle Peter, who is considered by many to be the first amongst the Apostles. But of course Rome was the seat of the Roman Empire for a very, very, very long time. And so you could imagine the Bishop of the Church of Rome, the Pope of Rome would be a very powerful figure. Now you also have the Bishop or the Patriarch of Constantinople, which is another capital and really the capital of the Byzantine Empire."
Social Studies,"And so what we're going to see, over the next several hundred years, is the jockeying for position amongst these three, in particular the Byzantine Emperor and the Pope of Rome. The Pope of Rome starts to consider themselves as really the leader of all of Christendom."
Social Studies,"The Patriarch of Constantinople and the bishops of the other major centers of Christianity, like Antioch and Jerusalem and Alexandria, they view themselves as all kind of a college of, as peers and they will give extra space for the Pope of Rome or the Bishop of Rome, because of the importance of that city and the significance of how the Church of Rome was founded."
Social Studies,"And this gets, this jockeying for power over the next several hundred years gets even more complex as the West, what was the Western Roman Empire, or some of the areas of the Western Roman Empire, start to get consolidated under Germanic rule really, Frankish rule and you start having this notion of a Holy Roman Emperor that we'll talk about in a few hundred years down our timeline. So, keep a look out for this power struggle."
Social Studies,"We're going to talk about particular issues of theological doctrine, things like the filoque issue, things like the relationship between the Father and the Son, whether you should have icons. But, at the end of the day, what's eventually going to lead to the Great Schism, in the beginning of the Second Millennium, is this power struggle.."
Social Studies,"He even convenes them in order to unify the Christians, to have a more unified sense of what it means to be Christian, in order to settle things like the Arian Controversy, and he converts himself to Christianity. And as we exit the fourth century, you have Theodosius, who makes Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire and then begins to persecute other religions."
Social Studies,"Now, what we're going to do in this video is continue the narrative, and in particular, we're going to see how there's an evolution between the church in the west and the church in the east. In previous videos, we already talk about how the Roman Empire itself is initially administered between west and east, and then that administration becomes more and more formal. Theodosius is the last emperor to truly rule both halves. They start getting ruled separately."
Social Studies,"And as you get into the latter half of the fifth century, the western empire itself falls to Germanic conquerors. Now, in previous videos, we talk about how the emperors who rule from Constantinople consider themselves to continue the Roman Empire. They didn't call themselves the Byzantine Empire, as we now call them. They call themselves the Roman Empire. They considered themselves Roman emperors. The west falls, as I just mentioned, into a bunch of Germanic kingdoms."
Social Studies,"Justinian is able to reclaim a lot of the land formerly lost in the western Roman Empire. Now, there's some other interesting actors we see emerging on this map, and once again, we're now in the sixth century. You have these Germanic tribes, the Visigothic kingdoms here in modern-day Spain, and here in modern-day France, you have the Franks. And the word France really is referring to land of the Franks, another Germanic tribe. Now, they are able to factor much, much more relevantly."
Social Studies,"And when I say about, I'm saying over the next several hundred years in this eventual division, culturally and religiously, between east and west. As I mentioned in previous videos, the division, yes, it will center on notions of language. In the west, especially in the church, Latin is used. In the east, in the church, Greek is used. There are spiritual debates that we will touch on in a few minutes, but there's also a power struggle. You have the Byzantine Emperor seated in Constantinople."
Social Studies,"You have the Bishop of Rome, now known as the Pope, the Pope of Rome, who considers themselves more and more the leader of all of Christianity, and their argument there is look, this is the church that, according to tradition, was founded by Peter, first amongst the apostles. You have the patriarch of Constantinople and patriarchs of other significant centers of Christianity that say wait, hold on a second. Yes, Bishop of Rome, you are very important. But we consider you to be first amongst equals."
Social Studies,"You don't have jurisdiction over all of Christendom. Together we have jurisdiction. And this was, to some degree, the case under Justinian, and it was very clear at this time that the Byzantine emperor was very powerful, not just over the temporal realm, really referring to the day-to-day material realm, but also a lot of influence on the spiritual realm, which was really supposed to be the domain of the bishops or the popes or the patriarchs."
Social Studies,"This notion of the pentarchy was codified in the Justinian law, this idea that these five centers of Christianity really have extra weight and collectively are really leading Christendom. Now, as I mentioned, things get interesting as we fast forward about 250 years. So let's go to the year 800. So, one thing you might notice is that group in yellow, the Franks, have now conquered a lot more, and they're conquering it under the leadership of Charlemagne. At the same time, you see this green over here."
Social Studies,"Islam has dramatically spread from its founding in the early seventh century, all the way now as we're exiting the eighth century, to cover most of the Middle East, Persia, bordering on modern-day Pakistan, India, north Africa, and even going into modern-day Spain. At the same time, especially because of these Islamic conquests, the Byzantine Empire and the Byzantine emperor is significantly weaker."
Social Studies,"So you can imagine the pope in Rome here saying, well, who's going to protect me, especially from my political enemies? Now, Charlemagne considers himself something of a protector of Christianity, and Pope Leo III goes to him for protection, and Charlemagne is able to actually provide it. And in exchange, or perhaps in thanks for that, the pope crowns Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor."
Social Studies,"Now, what's significant about this is it really introduces a fourth actor here, because the title Holy Roman Emperor was intentionally given to say, look, now you, Charlemagne, you are the heir to the grandeur of Rome. You are the heir to the Roman emperors. Now, you might be saying, wait, isn't that what the Byzantine emperors thought they were? Didn't they think this was the Roman Empire? And at that time, their emperor was an empress. It was Empress Irene of Athens."
Social Studies,"And so once again, this is creating further tension. They're using different languages, Latin versus Greek. You now have the western pope recognizing a different, I guess you could say, Roman emperor in Charlemagne. The nature of the west is becoming more Germanic, and using the language Latin, while the nature of the east is continuing in Greek traditions. On top of that, what you have in the year 800, you're actually in this period where you've had several conflicts over this notion of iconoclasm."
Social Studies,"This iconoclasm movement, you could say, started in 726 when the Byzantine emperor said, enough of these images of Jesus and the Virgin Mary and other figures of Christianity in our churches, citing references in the Old Testament saying that hey, we shouldn't have these images. And so this iconoclasm or these destroying of icons starts to begin. Well, the pope in the west, they say, hey, we don't think we have to listen to you. I am the Bishop of Rome. I have universal jurisdiction."
Social Studies,"And then to add insult to injury, now, in 800, you have Charlemagne being crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Now, a thread further running through this is something we've talked about in a previous video, this notion of filioque, where in 381, the Council of Constantinople, they augment the Nicene Creed where they say, and we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life who proceeds from the Father. Well, in the west, they add the Latin term filioque, which means and the Son."
Social Studies,"This is touching on some of these notions in the Arian Heresy where, where does the Holy Spirit proceed from, if the Father and Son are really co-divine, co-equal, of the same substance, shouldn't the Holy Spirit proceed from both rather than just one? Well, those in the east said, hey, this isn't what we agreed to, while those in the west say, hey, we don't think it's so important that you agree to things, because we have the seat at Rome, the seat that was established by Peter.."
Social Studies,"As you can see here, the empire of Charlemagne is now broken up. The West, West Francia, starting to resemble modern-day France, not quite exactly. And the eastern two thirds are now under the control of Otto, a German king. And because of his ability to offer protection, and frankly just his power, he is crowned Holy Roman Emperor. One of the reasons why this is significant, once again, it's saying, hey, the Byzantine Emperor isn't really the heir to the Roman Empires."
Social Studies,"This Holy Roman Emperor, but Otto is able to create a line of Holy Roman Emperors that continues all the way until 1806 when they are conquered by Napoleon Bonaparte. Now, the Holy Roman Empire itself, and Voltaire famously said, ""It is neither holy nor Roman, ""nor an Empire."" Over various days in its history is fragmented. It's many kingdoms with different levels of autonomy. But under Otto, it was quite unified."
Social Studies,"Now as we get into the 11th century, the divide between East and West becomes even more pronounced. We've already talked about this ongoing power struggle between West and East, between which bishops have primacy over Christendom. We've talked about, hey, who is the real heir to the Roman Empire? We've talked about Latin versus Greek. We've talked about the Germanic kings having influence now, and really following the West. We've talked about the notion of fo-lo-quay. And those aren't all of the issues."
Social Studies,"On top of that, you have this notion of leavened and unleavened bread. Where in the West, in their mass, when they are consecrating the bread to be viewed as the body of Christ. They used unleavened bread based on the belief that this is what Christ used during the Last Supper. In the East, they said no, we have agreed to use leavened bread. And so this is one further tension."
Social Studies,"Even more than the actual issues are the sense of, ""Well, why do you think you have the right ""to tell me what to do?"" And as we get into 1053, you have what are known as the Latin churches in Constantinople being shut down by the patriarch of Constantinople. Patriarch Cerularius, or Carry-u-larius."
Social Studies,"Saying that, ""Hey, these guys are going against ""what is actually acceptable in Christianity."" Now in retaliation, you have Pope Leo IX shutting down what would be known as Greek churches and how they practice in the Italian Peninsula. Either closing them down or forcing them to practice the way the Latins practice. Now there's a whole complicated series of events as we go into 1053 and 1054. Letters are sent back and forth. Eventually, Pope Leo IX sends a delegation to Constantinople."
Social Studies,"Part of it is to see if they can coordinate against Norman conquerors on the Italian Peninsula. But part of it is also to make clear what Pope Leo IX believes, that, ""Hey, you have no right ""to criticize us about this unleavened bread. ""You don't have authority over us. ""I am the pope in Rome. ""I have the seat of Peter, first amongst apostles."" And the leader of the delegation is a particularly proud and principled individual. When they go to Constantinople, Patriarch Cerularius doesn't even meet them."
Social Studies,"Essentially he's rebuffing their demands. And so because of that, that delegation decides to excommunicate Cerularius, the Patriarch of Constantinople. The leader of what is now the most important church in the East. Remember, the other significant centers of Christianity are now under Muslim rule. Well, in retaliation to that, Patriarch Cerularius says, ""Hey, you can't excommunicate me. ""In fact, I'm going to excommunicate you."" And he excommunicates the delegation."
Social Studies,"Excommunication says, ""I am saying you ""are no longer part of the church."" Now, when all of these cross excommunications are happening, many people probably viewed this as, ""Hey, this is just a power struggle between folks, ""probably not a big deal."" But remember, this is over centuries of increasing division. Not only do you have language division, in the West, you have a leaning towards these Germanic kingdoms."
Social Studies,"In the East, they say, ""Hey, we are the real Roman Empire."" You have these issues of fo-lo-quay, and other things. And this event in 1054 eventually gets known as the Great Schism, or the East-West Schism because it only gets further and further cemented. And they get only further and further apart. As you get to the end of the 11th century, the Crusades begin. And we'll do more videos detailing the Crusades."
Social Studies,"Where the Western kings start sending folks at first on the surface to try to help the Byzantines reconquer land from the Muslim empires. But even when they are successful, they don't give that land back to the Byzantines. They actually set up Crusader kingdoms. And as they make their way through the Byzantine Empire, they cause, for the most part, a bit of a stir. They're not particularly respectful through the lands that they pass."
Social Studies,"And it really comes to a point in 1204 where at the end of the fourth Crusade, the Crusaders actually decide, even though the purpose was arguably to reclaim land from the Muslims, the Crusaders decide to siege and sack Constantinople itself and take over. Now a few decades later, the Byzantine nobility is able to retake it. But that kind of cements the difference between the Latin and the Greek church."
Social Studies,"Known today as the Catholic Church, followed by roughly one and a half billion people and the Eastern Orthodox Church, followed by roughly 250 million people.."
Social Studies,"Remember in the 7th century as Islam expanded out over Arabia, it quickly overran much of the territory in the Holy Land that at the time was controlled by the Byzantines, Byzantine being another word for the Eastern Roman Empire. By the time of this map, Islam had been in control of the Middle East, the Holy Land, North Africa, and even a good chunk of the Iberian Peninsula for several hundred years, as much as over 400 years."
Social Studies,"As we get closer to this time period, you have the Seljuq Turks continuing to eat in to the Byzantine Empire and taking most of the Anatolian peninsula. Also at this time, remember, we are in the high Middle Ages, which is a time when, especially western Europe, is on the rise. There's increased agricultural productivity, the population is increasing. And it's in this context that the emperor of the Byzantines, the emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire looks for help."
Social Studies,"Emperor Alexios I sends a delegation, sends an ambassador to Pope Urban II, and he essentially asks for some mercenaries to help him retake some of Anatolia from the Muslims. Well, Pope Urban II sees an opportunity here. It's been roughly half a century since the Great Schism. He has his own internal struggles going on and struggles with some neighboring states. He sees this, potentially, as an opportunity to focus attention elsewhere."
Social Studies,"And so later that year, in November of 1095, he makes a sermon at Claremont in the kingdom of France. There are varying accounts of his speech, but this is one of them. I, or rather the Lord, beseech you as Christ's heralds to publish this everywhere and to perse, which is another way of saying to persuade, all people of whatever rank, foot soldiers, and knights, poor and rich, to carry aid promptly to those Christians, so to the Byzantines, and to destroy that vile race from the lands of our friends."
Social Studies,"When he's talking about vile race, he's talking about the Muslims who have control of the Anatolian peninsula and of the Holy Land. I saw those to those who are present. It is meant also for those who are absent. Moreover, Christ commands it. And according to this account, he goes onto say, all who die by the way, whether by land or by sea, or in battle against the pagans, shall have immediate remission of sins."
Social Studies,"So this is this idea of indulgences, where hey you do something for me, I can forgive your sins. This I grant them through the power of God with which I am invested. O what a disgrace if such a despised and base race, once again he's talking about the Muslims, which worships demons, should conquer a people which has the faith of omnipotent God and is made glorious with the name of Christ. Pope Urban II's speech has an impact larger than even he expects."
Social Studies,"Throughout Western Europe, news of his speech, news of his call to go and retake the Holy Land, to fight against this despised and base race, the Muslims, takes hold. And before the Pope is even able to organize a formal army, you have someone by the name of Peter the Hermit lead what's called the People's Crusade in 1096. And this is often considered the first part of the first crusade."
Social Studies,"As they march through the Rhineland in what is now Germany, they massacre Jews, several thousand, calling them Christ killers on their way to the Holy Land, and this is a theme that you will see throughout the Crusades. Even though the crusaders ostensibly were there to help the Byzantines, ostensibly to take back the Holy Land, as they travel through foreign lands, they often wreak a lot of havoc, even sometimes on the Byzantines themselves, but the People's Crusade itself was very unsuccessful."
Social Studies,"By the time they got to the Anatolian peninsula, remember, Peter the Hermit was leading, there were women, there were children, there were untrained peasants fighting, they were massacred by the Turks when they got to the Anatolian peninsula."
Social Studies,"But eventually, the Pope was able to organize a more formal, what eventually gets called First Crusade, and once again, it surpasses the Pope's expectations and far surpasses Alexios, the Byzantine emperor's expectations, and it's even a little bit frightening to him where you have on the order of 100,000 soldiers coming from western Europe taking these various routes by both land and by sea."
Social Studies,"And in 1099, they are eventually able to take Jerusalem from the Muslims, and both in their taking of Antioch and Jerusalem, most historical accounts say it was quite bloody with significant chunks of the cities being massacred. This is a later image of what it might have looked like when they conquered Jerusalem. And from that time period through most of the 12th century, they maintain control of the Holy Land. This is what the map looks like in 1135, and you might notice some changes now."
Social Studies,"The Byzantine Empire has reconquered chunks of the Anatolian peninsula, in particular the west and the north, and you see these blue regions here which are known as Crusader Kingdoms."
Social Studies,"We can zoom in on these Crusader Kingdoms, or Crusader states, and what's interesting about them, even though these western European crusaders, now they weren't called crusaders at first, but they wore a cross on their outfits and were eventually called crusaders, even though their goal at first was apparently to help retake land for the Byzantines, when they were able to take the land, for the most part, they kept it."
Social Studies,"And they set up these Crusader states, or these Crusader kingdoms that you see right over here that they're going to stay in control of for most of the 12th century. As you get into the middle of the 12th century, the Muslims are able to take back a few significant cities, which is going to catalyze the Second Crusades, but then as we get to 1187, the Muslim ruler Saladin is able to take back Jerusalem, which as we'll see in the next video, will instigate the Third Crusade.."
Social Studies,"This is a zoomed in version of what it looked like, and you can see these Crusader states that were set up, or these Crusader kingdoms, and, as I pointed out in the last video, even though the Crusades were apparently to help the Byzantines reclaim land, as you can see, when the Crusaders took the Holy Land, they, for the most part, kept it for themselves and sat up these kingdoms. So, we are about here. We are about here on our timeline."
Social Studies,"Now, as we fast forward a little over a decade, as we get to the middle of the 12th century, you do have the Muslims being able to take back some of the territory. In particular, Edessa and Aleppo, and so this spawns what will eventually be known as the Second Crusade, and it's really the second of many crusades. Now, these are what historians consider the official numbered crusades, but there were many other crusades in this time period, in roughly this 200 year time period during the High Middle Ages."
Social Studies,"You had crusades against Germanic non-Christians in Northern Europe. You had crusades in Spain in order to retake land from the Muslims, which they had for several hundred years, what's known as the Reconquista. So, after Aleppo and Edessa were taken, you have the Second Crusades, which end up being quite unsuccessful, and it really doesn't change what the Middle East looks like, but then, as you get to the end of the 12 century, you have a significant event."
Social Studies,"In 1187, you have the Sultan Salah ad-Din, often known as Saladin, being able to retake Jerusalem and much of the Holy Land. Remember, this is after roughly 90 years of rule of Jerusalem by the Western Europeans, by these Crusader kingdoms, so this really strikes a chord with the west, and so they decide to launch what will be known as the Third Crusade. The Third Crusade does make some gains. In fact, this is a crusade that gets significant buy-in from the king of Western Europe."
Social Studies,"Philip the Second of France gets involved. The English king, Richard the First, or Richard the Lionheart, gets involved. The Holy Roman Emperor Fredrick Barbarossa gets involved. When I say Holy Roman Emperor and the empire, you should really think of medieval Germany. Now, as they go there, Fredrick Barbarossa, he drowns in a river."
Social Studies,"This is very dispiriting for his soldiers, so many of them turn around, but Philip the Second and Richard the Lionheart are able to engage with Salah ad-Din, and they are able to gain some land. In particular, the region around Acre, and they're able to get some concessions from Salah ad-Din for unarmed Christian pilgrims to visit the Holy Land, especially Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"Now, Salah ad-Din dies as we approach the end of the 12 century, so in the beginning of the 13th century, the Fourth Crusades get launched, and these are interesting because the Crusaders, with the help of Venetian traders, they actually engage with the claimant to the throne of the Byzantine Empire, with the hope that if they can help them come back to the throne, then they can provide them the necessary resources in order to continue on with the Crusades."
Social Studies,"Well, they are able to put the claimant on the throne, but then an uprising takes that claimant down from the throne, and so the Crusaders don't get their payment, but they want that payment badly, and so, they decide to take Constantinople themselves, and as we mention in other videos, this is really the dagger in the heart between the relationship between the East and the West."
Social Studies,"We already talked about the Great Schism of 1054, but now, you have the West, who are followers of the Latin Church, which eventually gets known as the Roman Catholic Church. They are sacking Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine, or the Eastern Roman Empire, the most important city in Eastern Christiandom, and once they successfully sack the city in bloody fashion, they break up the Byzantine Empire amongst themselves, and you can see how they break it up."
Social Studies,"So, the Fourth Crusade had very little effect on the actual Holy Land, but it does cause a temporary end to the Byzantine Empire. As we get to 1261, Constantinople is retaken by the Byzantines, but once again, this is the beginning of the end of the Byzantine Empire. The fact that for half a century, it was taken over by the West, so you can imagine, with Jerusalem still in the hands of the Muslims, many in the West are not satisfied, and in 1212, an interesting event may have occurred."
Social Studies,"There are some accounts of what is known as a Children's Crusade. The stories of the Children Crusade are that a child, and there's different accounts as to exactly the story, but something to the effect that Jesus has told them to go with other pure children to the Holy Land and convert the Muslims to Christianity, and so then, they go on this march, and there's tens of thousands of children, but they don't make it to the Holy Land. They either die of starvation or they get sold into slavery on the way."
Social Studies,"Historians today aren't sure whether it really happened as that account implies. That's why I put these question marks next to the Children's Crusade, but regardless of the actual facts here, as we go into the first quarter of the 13th century, Jerusalem remains in the hands of the Muslims. A Fifth Crusade is launched to retake Jerusalem, which is a failure."
Social Studies,"Eventually, a Sixth Crusade is launched, and this is reasonably successful at retaking some land in the Holy Land, but shortly thereafter, you have a non-numbered crusade, the Barrens Crusade, that rivals the First Crusade in its success in taking territory, and so you can see, after the Barrens Crusade right over here, they're able to take back a good amount of territory, but then, in 1244, Jerusalem is retaken by the Muslims, and then you have the Seventh and Eighth and Ninth Crusades afterwards, and you have these other efforts that are sometimes called Crusades, but for the most part, these are unsuccessful, and as we get into the end of the 13th and early 14th centuries, the Holy Land falls back under Muslim control."
Social Studies,"This is a map of the region as we enter into the 14th century, and you can see that the Muslims have retaken not just the Holy Land, but most of the Anatolian Peninsula, with only Constantinople being in control of the Byzantines, and that lasts until 1453, when the Turks finally take Constantinople as well. When you look at the map at the beginning of this video and look at the map here, you can see that the Crusades weren't really successful at changing the picture in the Holy Land."
Social Studies,"There were areas where the Crusades were successful, or that Crusader mentality was successful. You can see that, now that we're in the 14th century, much of the Iberian Peninsula has been taken by Christian kingdoms from the Muslims. The Muslims, at this period, are left with only Grenada, so the Reconquista, to some degree, was successful, and it's going to continue until 1492, when the last Muslims are expelled from Spain."
Social Studies,"Now, one thing that I felt when I study the Crusades is it's very confusing how Jerusalem in particular goes back and forth between different parties, and just to get an overview of what actually happened, this timeline might be helpful. Green shows Jerusalem under Muslim control. Red shows it under Christian control, so at the end of the First Crusades, it switches hands. The Christians are in control all the way until Salah ad-Din takes it back."
Social Studies,"Now, the Muslims are in control all the way until you get to the Sixth Crusade, where they're able to take some territory back and even parts of Jerusalem, and especially in the Barrens Crusades, they're able to take significant territory back, but in 1244, Jerusalem is retaken again by the Muslims.."
Social Studies,"And you could see that here on this diagram where Jerusalem, at least, goes from green to red, controlled by the Western European, the Latin Christians. And they're able to maintain control through these Crusader kingdoms all the way until 1187, when Salah ad-Din is able to retake control of Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"Then a few decades later, as we go into the Sixth Crusade and the Barons' Crusade, which isn't depicted here, the Western Europeans are able to take more control but eventually, the Muslims take control of Jerusalem and as we enter into the 14th century, they have control of the entire Holy Land. Now while that is happening, Constantinople gets sacked at the end of the Fourth Crusade by the Crusaders themselves and even though it's retaken, this is really the beginning of the end for the Byzantine Empire."
Social Studies,"So let's think a little bit about how the Crusades changed Europe and the entire world. Well, one of the obvious impacts of the Crusades was just the amount of death it caused. It's estimated that the death toll from the Crusades is two to six million people just from Western Europe. And just to put that into perspective, the European population at the time was about 60 to 70 million folks. So we're talking about four to 10 percent of the population dying in the Crusades."
Social Studies,"And this isn't fully accounting for all of the death and destruction that happened on the way to the Crusades or that happened in the Middle East as well. If you look at this map of what the region looks like as we get into the 14th century, right over here, you can see that although the Middle East is still in control of the Muslims, Muslims have for the most part been pushed out of the Iberian Peninsula, and they have a little bit of a foothold right here in Grenada."
Social Studies,"And this Reconquista is going to continue all the way until 1492 when what will be the Spanish are able to push out all of the Muslims from the Iberian peninsula and as they do that, they also expel the Jews. You also have territorial gains in the north of Europe that's a little bit harder to see on this map over here."
Social Studies,"As I mentioned in previous video, part of this Crusader mentality was not just about taking land back for the Byzantines or taking land from the Muslims, but also trying to take land or convert what were perceived as pagans in the north, German tribes that had not as yet converted to Christianity. And so that helped for territorial expansion in the north of Europe. Now a big theme in the Crusades was the power of the Pope."
Social Studies,"Remember, the Crusades were started by a Pope working people up, saying, ""Hey, let's go help the Byzantines. ""Let's go take back land from the Muslims."" Pope Urban II. And over the course of this 200 years, you have this religious fervor where the Pope is organizing these Crusades. People are feeling this religious spirit. Many people are, before going on their Crusade, they're bequeathing their land to the Church."
Social Studies,"If they die, and many of these lords do end up dying, they're giving their property to the Church, headed by the Pope. Kings also gained power during the Crusades. In other videos, we talk about the feudal system and many times the vassals to the kings, the dukes, the counts, the barons, often had more control over their territory than the kings might have had."
Social Studies,"And they were constantly squabbling with each other but as people started to focus their energies on this external adventure known as the Crusades, first of all, many of these lords died, their property went back to the state, went back to the kings. You start having less internal dissension. In a way, this idea that Pope Urban II thought of at the end of the 11th century. Hey, why don't I point people externally so they stop worrying about what's going on internally? It kind of worked."
Social Studies,"Another trend is the importance of cities. In the feudal system, it's all about these manors and all about these estates. But in order to finance the Crusades, centers of trade and commerce became more important and also, as there was more interaction between West and East and more people traveling, you can imagine that it fostered trade which centered at these cities. And that goes into the next point, commerce and trade itself was fostered by the Crusades. It wasn't all fighting."
Social Studies,"The Venetians and other trader city-states, they helped facilitate the movement of arms and people from West to East, but on the way back, they also brought goods to trade. And so they became much, much more powerful. In fact, by the end of the Crusades, as we get into the 14th century, Venice, which is right over here on our map, was considered the richest and most powerful city in Europe. Venice has all of this trader wealth and it's not just from trade."
Social Studies,"As you might remember from previous videos, when Constantinople was sacked, it was sacked in part by these Venetian traders and after that, they built an empire. They broke up the Byzantine empire and took some of it for themselves. And so it's not a coincidence that as we get into the 14th and 15th century, places like Venice and Florence, famously sponsored by the Medici family, a famous banking family."
Social Studies,"So once again, these are centers of trade, centers of commerce became the places where the Renaissance would first flourish. And last but not least, as in some ways bloody and dark a time as the Crusades were, they were also associated with learning because you had all of these people go from Western Europe to the Middle East and the Holy Land and at that time, remember, we have videos on the Golden Age of Islam."
Social Studies,"In a lot of ways, they were shepherding the knowledge of the Ancient Greeks and the Romans and they were merging that with knowledge from the Indians and the Chinese and also coming up with innovations on their own. And a lot of the Western Europeans brought that back to Europe.."
Social Studies,"It's occurring during the high middle ages. In other videos we saw the first crusades start at the end of the 11th century, started really by Pope Urban the second with the purported reason to help the Byzantines take land from the Muslims, especially the Holy Land. The first crusade is for the most part successful but they don't return that land to the Byzantines."
Social Studies,"They set up what are known as Crusader States or Crusader Kingdoms including the Kingdom of Jerusalem and just to read this timeline that I drew up here, green shows a time period when at least Jerusalem is controlled by the Muslims. Red shows when Jerusalem is controlled by Western European powers or by these Crusader Kingdoms which were essentially Western European. These red parts on our timeline show when the actual crusades occurred."
Social Studies,"So you see the first crusade causes the change of control of Jerusalem from the Muslims to the Western European Christians and once Jerusalem was under their control and it would continue to be under their control for roughly 90 years, you could imagine that many pilgrims from Europe went to the holy sites in the Holy Land especially in Jerusalem, but this was not an easy journey."
Social Studies,"Not only was it a long journey, these are the paths that I showed in previous videos that the crusaders took, but this could also be the paths that many of the pilgrims took in order to go to the Holy Land and you could imagine a journey of this distance going through multiple kingdoms in this time period could be incredibly dangerous and many of the pilgrims actually were robbed or sometimes worse on their way to the Holy Land."
Social Studies,"So in 1119 a small group of Knights led by Hughes de Payens, they go to King Baldwin the second, King of Jerusalem. Remember they set up this crusader state, the Kingdom of Jerusalem headquartered on the temple mount and these knights tell King Baldwin the second and Warmund, or Patriarch Warmund the Patriarch of Jerusalem, they say we would like to protect these pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"These guys think it is a good idea and so in 1120 they give them some space, a headquarters on the temple mount in order to start their group. If you translate the Latin version of their name it translates to Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon."
Social Studies,"Now the reason why it says and the Temple of Solomon is because they were headquartered on the temple mount and the Al-Aqsa Mosque is believed by many to be on the site of the original Temple of Solomon, but this is often shortened to the Knights Templar. This is their symbol, two knights riding on a horse to show their poverty, but they don't stay poor for long. They are shortly thereafter recognized by the Pope and many people start donating money to this order."
Social Studies,Many more people volunteer to be Knights Templar and so over the remainder of the crusades they become an important institution in Medieval Europe. Now most folks often associate the Knights Templar with being Knights. You can see here one of the Knights on horseback. Here you see the Knights protecting pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem and they did do that.
Social Studies,"They did protect the pilgrims and they were also active in battle during the crusades thereafter, but it turns out that even though on the peak there were on the order of 20,000 Knights Templar, only about 10% of them were actual soldiers, were actually these warrior monks as they're sometimes called."
Social Studies,The rest of the Templars created this fairly significant complex infrastructure to do multiple things to support the goal of the Knights Templar and perhaps most significantly they developed a sprawling financial enterprise of the time.
Social Studies,"If you were in London and you wanted to do a pilgrimage to the Holy Land you would need resources in order to do that and you would want to have access to your wealth once you got to Jerusalem and so you could imagine if you were traveling over a long journey to take gold coins with you, not only would they be heavy but more importantly it would be dangerous."
Social Studies,"A lot of people might want to take that gold from you and so one of the services that the Knights Templar developed was that you could go to their temple in London essentially deposit your money, they'll give you a note of credit saying that, we the Knights owe you a certain amount of money, and then you make your journey and when you get to Jerusalem you can give that note to the Knights there and they will give you your money. Now this is something that we take for granted today."
Social Studies,"I can go to an ATM machine anywhere in the world and for the most part I can put in my ATM card and get access to money, but there's a lot of infrastructure that makes that happen. Today we have telecommunications, we have satellites that help information go back and forth, we have servers that keep track of all of that data."
Social Studies,They didn't have that in the middle ages and so you can imagine this is a very powerful idea that I could deposit money one place and then I could withdraw it someplace else and we still don't fully understand how the knights were able to pull this off.
Social Studies,"It requires a lot of trust and how were they able to authenticate the notes of credit at any of these points? Not only did they do this type of deposit and withdrawal in multiple locations, they also because they had all of these deposits and people were also donating money to them just to support their cause, they were able to provide loans. Often times loans to very powerful individuals like kings and nobility. They were often brokers in major transactions."
Social Studies,This is the reason why historians really do consider them perhaps the first true international bank.
Social Studies,"In other videos we talk about how in 1187 Saladin is able to retake Jerusalem but then in the Sixth Crusade and the Barons' Crusades it goes back to Christian hands but then 1244 it's retaken again by the Muslims and it stays under Muslim control all the way until the end of World War One and so with Jerusalem taken in 1244 the whole goal of the Knights Templar, the whole purpose of their existence starts to become less important."
Social Studies,"Although at this point they are a significant and influential financial institution. As we go to the end of the 13th century the whole crusader mentality starts to lose steam. You have the Eighth and Ninth Crusades but they aren't successful and as we get into the early 14th century you have this character Philip the Fourth, King of France and he has incurred a lot of debt in order to have wars especially with England and a good bit of this financing comes from the Knights Templar."
Social Studies,"He is a powerful man looking for solutions to his debt situation and he realizes one solution is maybe just to arrest the people who you owe money to and then not only do you not owe any money to them, but you can seize their assets and Philip the fourth does exactly that. Famously on a Friday the 13th in 1307 he arrests many Knights Templars including the Grand Master, the leader of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay. He tortures them."
Social Studies,"They eventually confess to a whole bunch of things but then they retract that confession and they're not willing to retract the retraction and so in 1314 Jacques de Molay as well as other Knights Templar, especially in the leadership, who do not agree to those confessions are burned at the stake in Paris and this is considered the end of the Knights Templar although there are many legends of how they have continued on perhaps in secrecy. So the Knights Templar are to this day are a subject of fascination."
Social Studies,"There's many legends associated with them, but one of their biggest historical contributions that isn't often talked about but we know happened, is that they really laid the foundation for what we today consider modern international banking.."
Social Studies,"In the year 1200, the third Crusade has just ended and is mildly successful, but Jerusalem is still in control of the Muslims. The Byzantine Empire, what's left of the true Roman Empire, is on the decline, losing more and more territory to the Turks. In the Middle East and Persia, you have the golden age of Islam. The Abbasid Caliphate is still around, although it is now have been fragmented into many different Muslim empires."
Social Studies,"Modern-day north India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan is under control of the Ghurid Sultanate, with the rest of India being divided amongst various Hindu kingdoms. In the east, in other videos, we study the Song Dynasty, which is one of the really high points of Chinese civilization, although they're suspicious of their northern neighbors."
Social Studies,"But in the midst of all of this, it ends up being a nomadic people that we really haven't talked a lot about in our survey of world history that become the main catalyst for change over the next several hundred years. And that is the Mongols. So let's move forward to the year 1206."
Social Studies,"In the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, you have a leader by the name of Temujin arise in Mongolia and he's able to unite the various nomadic tribes and declares in 1206 a Mongol Empire you see here in this yellow color. He is eventually called Genghis, or Genghis Khan, the great Khan, the great ruler, or the universal ruler."
Social Studies,"Now, even though the Mongols were not a focus point of world history up until this point, they did have several very significant things going for them at this point in history. As nomadic tribes of herders, they were excellent horsemen and they were also excellent archers, capable of shooting an arrow in any direction while riding a horse. So as a military, they were incredibly nimble, they were incredibly fast, they were incredibly brutal, but they were also incredibly adaptable."
Social Studies,"As they conquered more and more people, they learned from them and by the time of Genghis Khan's death in 1227, they had conquered much of northern Asia. And the Mongols will continue on. Within half a century of Genghis Khan's death, they will have conquered not just northern Asia. When they capture Baghdad, many historians consider this the end of the Islamic golden age."
Social Studies,"As much pressure as the western Europeans were putting on the Turks during the Crusades, it was actually the Mongol threat that was much more significant. Before fragmenting, it is the largest contiguous empire in world history. I use the word contiguous because the British Empire actually covers more land, as we'll see, a few hundred years later. But the Mongolian Empire, all of the land was connected, it was contiguous."
Social Studies,"But as you can see from this drawing, they begin to fragment into what's referred to as multiple Khanates, that become more and more independent in the second half of the thirteenth century. As we get into the fourteenth century, we can see that it is now fragmented into multiple, still very significant empires. In the east, you have Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty, controlling modern-day Mongolia and China, reemphasizing the importance of Buddhism until they eventually get reconquered by the Ming Dynasty."
Social Studies,"In central Asia, you have the Chagatai Khanate. In northwest Asia and eastern Europe, getting as far as Poland, you have the Golden Horde. And in Persia and the Caucasus, you have the Ilkhanate, which you can view as a subordinate Khanate, but is now independent. The Khanates in the west eventually convert to Islam."
Social Studies,Super important to understand because many of the empires that we are about to study in Asia and the Middle East have roots in the Mongolian Empire and roots in what Genghis Khan started in 1206..
Social Studies,"They weren't a centralized empire. They were a band of traveling horsemen. How did they end up taking this much land? The story of the Mongols is a story of a non-state actor overcoming state actors, of a decentralized power becoming centralized eventually. What I wanna talk about in this video is three reasons why the Mongols were so effective in beating established empires. And then we're gonna talk about some of those follow-on effects."
Social Studies,"Reason one why the Mongols were so effective was planning, what we might call logistics. When Genghis Kahn, lemme pull up a picture of good ol' Genghis, when Genghis was declared Emperor, or Great Khan, of the Mongols in 1206, one of the first things he did was reformat the army. He swept away tribal affiliations and favoritism. If you were good, you got to have a higher position; if you were bad, you didn't."
Social Studies,This meant that ordinary people within the Mongol army felt that they could have a measure of social mobility if they performed especially well in the army. This made them very committed and very loyal. Reason number two: the Mongols were extremely adaptable. We're talking about a group of horsemen here. These are the Mongols attacking a group of Chinese soldiers. What they were used to was mounted combat against mounted opponents.
Social Studies,"What they weren't used to was attacking major cities and holding them, or even trying to get major cities to break. But what the adaptability of the Mongol army meant was that as they conquered new territories and as they fought and won and lost in various regions of Asia, so, for example, as they started conquering the Western Xia here, they learned siegecraft, and that's the art of attacking walled cities and castles. It's a completely different style of combat."
Social Studies,"What it involves is sitting outside of a city, and waiting to starve out the inhabitants. Part of it involves using these things called siege engines. This here is a kind of catapult. You can see here the rocks. The Mongols are waiting with their archers here. The opponents have arrows, as well, but they're flinging rocks into the city in order to force a surrender."
Social Studies,"The Mongols didn't really have this technology or these tactics when they began their military campaigns; but as they rolled through Central Asia they picked it up, and then they continued to use those tactics as they swept westward. Now, the third reason that the Mongols were so effective is because they were terrifying. Even though they mastered siege warfare, in the beginning at least, the Mongols were not prepared to hold a city once they had conquered it."
Social Studies,"There are stories, especially from the conquest of the Western Xia and the Northern Song and the Khwarazmian Empire over here, that tell of the Mongols winning a battle and then sweeping in and murdering everyone. Just pulling plunder from corpses, and just looting the entire city, and leaving nothing standing. Because the Mongols weren't especially interested, at least early, we're talking about the period of Genghis Khan's life here, so, 1200s to 1220s, they weren't especially interested in governing."
Social Studies,"They wanted to hold territory, and get tribute, and get money, but they weren't especially interested in running an empire. It actually made more sense to them to slaughter everybody and take your things. Now, it got to the point that this reputation for fearsomeness got so powerful that some cities would just give up and surrender the moment the Mongols arrived. Those are the three main reasons that comprise Mongol effectiveness against settled states. They were very good at planning."
Social Studies,"Everybody rode in their armies. They could move very quickly. The Mongols were extremely adaptable. Every time they lost, they learned something from the people they lost to, and that meant that they picked up new technologies like siege warfare. And they were absolutely terrifying. Since, initially, the Mongols didn't know what they were gonna do with a conquered city besides loot it, they just killed everybody, and that reputation really allowed them to conquer a lot of land very quickly."
Social Studies,"And so we see out of the Mongol conquest, there are many follow-on effects, but one of the chief ones is something called the Pax Mongolica, the Mongolian Peace. If that phrasing looks familiar to you, it's because it's similar to the Roman Peace, the Pax Romana; and the Chinese Peace, the Pax Sinica of the First Century CE. This is 1100 years later, but the same principle applies."
Social Studies,"What happened was, with all of this territory conquered under one ruling power, it became safe to travel from one end of the empire to the other. Indeed, this is exactly what Marco Polo did when he set off from Venice, and made his way, eventually, to Beijing. That would've been around this time. Marco Polo's book, The Book of the Marvels of the World, was published in 1300. Marco Polo was this Venetian trader and adventurer who traveled extensively throughout Asia."
Social Studies,"That's one result of the Mongol conquests, is this Mongolian Peace. I should say that this Mongolian Peace came at a terrible price. When we were talking about that terror of the Mongols, that's a for-real thing. They murdered millions of people. But what would come after the Mongol Conquest as a result of this peace would end up killing even more people than the Mongol Conquest itself."
Social Studies,"This pacified region, this Mongolian Peace, led to increased trade throughout East Asia and reconnecting it to Eurasia and the Arab States. That would result in the exchanges of new ideas and new technologies and new agricultural techniques. But, as trade always does, it also results in the exchange of diseases. And so, out of the Mongol homeland, in fact, comes this illness called the Black Plague, or Bubonic Plague."
Social Studies,"Because of the stability of trade that had been established by the Mongol Peace, it makes it so much easier for this illness to sweep across Asia and Europe, killing even more people than even Genghis Khan could've achieved during his lifetime.."
Social Studies,"As you might remember from previous videos, as we entered into the 13th century, you have Genghis Khan or Genghis Khan take over much of Asia from Mongolia. But by the time you get to 1300, the empire has fragmented into these various khanates. The Yuan Dynasty in China, Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, the Golden Horde in Northwest Asia, and the Ilkhanate in Persia and the Middle East."
Social Studies,"Now, two things to keep note of as we look at this map that are relevant to this video is notice this tiny little kingdom right over here. This is one of the many fragmented kingdoms that result after the Sultanate of Rum collapses in the middle of the 13th century. This kingdom in particular is founded by someone by the name of Osman, or the Arabic version of the name would be Uthman or Othman. And so this is the nascent Ottoman empire forming right over here."
Social Studies,"And over here you have the Delhi Sultanate, which was the first significant Muslim empire over in North India. And notably, they were one of the few empires that were able to fend off the Mongols. But now let's fast forward roughly 100 years. Now a few things have changed. The Ming Dynasty has taken over the Yuan Dynasty in the middle of the 14th century. The Mongols in the east are now relegated to the Northern Yuan Dynasty, but there still is the Chagatai Khanate and the Golden Horde."
Social Studies,"But much of their territory, including the Ilkhanate, has now been taken over by Timur, who we talk about in previous videos. And Timur famously sacked Delhi and really brought the Delhi Sultanate to its knees and as we will see, it will only last for roughly another 100 years. Now, you might also notice that the Ottoman empire, founded by Osman or Othman is continuing to grow and continuing to conquer. Now one thing to keep in mind."
Social Studies,"In previous videos, we talk about the invention of gunpowder in Tang China and the early Song dynasty, which was about four to five hundred years before the period that we're talking about right now. But as we get into this period, we are now starting to see the use of gunpowder for guns and in particular artillery. And when I say artillery, think cannons. So let's fast forward another 200 years to see how the empires of Asia have evolved. So now we see several things."
Social Studies,"The Ming Dynasty is still in control of much of China. The Northern Yuan are still in Mongolia. You have a Kazakh Khanate, descendant from the Mongols. By the late 16th and early 17th century the Ottoman Empire has now expanded significantly, encompassing much of the Middle East. In Persia, you see that the Timurid Empire fell within a few decades after the death of Timur. And as we enter into the 16th century, you have the Safavid Dynasty take over."
Social Studies,"And then also in the 16th century, almost coincident with the founding of the Safavid Dynasty in Persia, you have Timur's grandson's great-grandson, Babur, who's born in current-day Uzbekistan, is able to defeat the Delhi Sultanate and establish the Mughal Empire. And Mughal is just the Persian word for Mongol and Babur is a direct descendant of Timur on his father's side and of Genghis Khan on his mother's side."
Social Studies,"Now, many historians often group these three empires or dynasties together because they do share some commonalities. And so let's think about each of them individually and think about where they are similar and where they are different. Not a lot is known about Osman who founds that first kingdom in the Anatolian peninsula. It's a Sunni Islamic empire. In fact, the leader is eventually named a caliph. The ruling class of this empire is Turkish."
Social Studies,"Now, one of their distinguishing characteristics is what's known as the Devshirme system in which the Sultan, the Emperor, would have a personal army of what could be called slaves, these Janissaries. These Janissaries were actually Christian boys taken at a young age and then indoctrinated into the Janissary system."
Social Studies,"The reason why I said you can kind of call them slaves is that although they were forced to become Janissaries and taken from their families, they were given many privileges and over time, many of these Janissaries became some of the most notable figures in the Ottoman Empire, some of them even becoming the Grand Vizier, effectively ruling over the empire. Now, the Ottomans are also known for one of the earliest empires to very successfully to use gunpowder in battle."
Social Studies,"The Safavids, as you can see here, were really founded in the very early 16th century, officially 1501, by their founder Shah Ismail, sometimes known as Ismail I. And he is the heir to a religious dynasty, the Safavias. It is a Muslim dynasty, like the Ottoman Empire, but unlike the Ottoman Empire, it is based on Twelver Shia Islam. Twelver Shia is the major group of Shias today and it is based on the belief of 12 imams following Mohammed starting with Ali and we have videos on the Sunni-Shia split."
Social Studies,"Now, even though Ismail spoke Turkish and was raised in a Turkic society, this dynasty brought back much of the culture of Ancient Persia. In fact, it's viewed as the first dynasty since the Sassanids that actually had native Persian rule and brought back that Persian culture, part of which is using the word Shah. You remember Cyrus the Great, the Shahanshah, the King of Kings. Now they had what is known as Ghulams, which is very similar to the idea of a Janissary."
Social Studies,"These are slave soldiers which are taken as captives but then are raised to be an elite military unit and eventually often have significant wealth and significant power. Now you might be wondering, why did any of these empires and these aren't the only ones, you have the Mamluks and other Muslim empires. Why would people create these elite soldiers out of slaves and give them that much power? Well, the answer is, they were the safest people to give power to."
Social Studies,"Remember, these empires are ruling over many tribes and many groups and many kingdoms that are constantly vying for power, trying to establish their own dynasties. And if you allowed people from those various tribes to protect you as Emperor, well, there might be a good shot that one of them might want to kill you and establish their own dynasty. But from a young age, if you could indoctrinate these young boys as Ghulams, or as Janissaries, well, they might be more loyal to you."
Social Studies,"And indeed, it did provide an unusual amount of stability. As I mentioned, the Mughal Empire was able to be founded by Babur, who was Timur's great-grandson's grandson and he, too, was born in a Turco-Mongolian tradition. As he's able to famously defeat the Delhi Sultanate which had already been significantly weakened, one, on its own, but then by Timur over 100 years before, he famously comes to power with the aid of gunpowder, being able to defeat a significantly larger Delhi Sultanate army."
Social Studies,"The Mughals practiced Sunni Islam but they ruled over a large Hindu majority, and so the first several Mughal rulers were actually quite tolerant. Perhaps the most tolerant was Akbar, often known as Akbar the Great, who we'll do other videos on, who actually tried to create a religion which was a merger between Islam and Hinduism and Jainism and Christianity. But then they become less tolerant under Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb."
Social Studies,"Shah Jahan famous for building the Taj Mahal for his wife, but what's often not noted is he was building this fairly grand mausoleum at a time when there was a famine in India and he was also known as being fairly intolerant and persecuted many Hindus and Sikhs and his son, Aurangzeb, continued to do so. Now, some historians will refer to these three empires as the Gunpowder Empires. If someone says Gunpowder Empires, they're referring to these three."
Social Studies,"The reason why they're called that is this view that these major centralized empires were able to form only with the power of gunpowder. The Ottomans, famous for early use of artillery. The Mughals, Babur in particular, came to power with gunpowder. But today, historians are somewhat skeptical of grouping just these three empires as Gunpowder Empires. You had many other large centralized empires form before the use of gunpowder. So that whole thesis is not as popular today.."
Social Studies,"So here we are in the third century B.C.E. and you have your first true emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, and the dynasty that he sets up is known as the Qin Dynasty which will be shortly lived but it's known as the first dynasty to truly unify China. This is where we believe the word China actually comes from, from the Qin Dynasty. The dynasty is known for its fairly harsh, centralized rule motivated over the foundation on legalism."
Social Studies,"In terms of relics that we have from that period, you might have heard of the Terra Cotta Army which was buried along with Qin Shi Huang's grave. Now the Qin Dynasty is most known for ending the Warring States Period and unifying China, and really laying the foundation for the Golden Age of China that will happen in the Han Dynasty. The Han Dynasty lasts from roughly 200 B.C.E. to a little after 200 C.E. And in my head I think of it as bit of a contemporary as the Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"The 200 years of the Western Han Dynasty correspond roughly to the Roman Republic, and as we get to the Eastern Han Dynasty, that corresponds to really the heyday of the Roman Empire. And it's also a golden age of China, a time where science and the arts, and especially Confucianism begins to really take hold in China, becomes officially part of the civil service, part of the bureaucracy."
Social Studies,"The Han Dynasty was so successful at unifying China culturally and linguistically, that today, 92% of Chinese identify themselves as ethnically Han. So sometimes you'll hear the word Han referring to the Han Dynasty, and sometimes it will be referring to the Han ethnic group, which really derives from the notion of the unification under the Han Dynasty."
Social Studies,"Now the Han Dynasty, as we see here, ends at the beginning of the third century in the Common Era, and then China gets fragmented again, and it gets split into multiple dynasties. This roughly 360 years that I don't have marked on my timeline, it's not that nothing was happening in China, in fact, a lot was, but China was not unified. To get a sense of that, here is China during the Three Kingdoms Period in the third century, shortly after the fall of the Han Dynasty."
Social Studies,"You see the Jin Dynasty depicted here in the fourth century, still part of what's often known as the Six Dynasties Period, this roughly 360 years of a fragmented China. And then you see this North and South Dynasty Period here in the sixth century. And eventually, China is reunified, and that happens under the Sui. It is unified under Emperor Wen of Sui for whom the dynasty is known, and similar to the Qin, what the Sui are most known for is taking this chaotic period and finally unifying China."
Social Studies,"And the Sui are ethnically Han, and they lay the foundation for another golden age of China under the Tang and the Sung Dynasties. The Tang Dynasty depicted here, it rivals the Han as a golden age of China. It's a time where the arts, the sciences really come about. One interesting thing about this Six Dynasties Period that we talk about, which is a chaotic time, it is a time that Buddhism starts to come into China from central Asia, originally from India, and by the Sui and the Tang, it really takes hold."
Social Studies,"Now one of the most important innovations that comes from Tang China is the notion of block printing. What you see depicted here is one of the first books ever printed, the Diamond Sutra, during the Tang Dynasty. Now, after the Tang falls in 907, you have, on a historical time scale, a relatively brief period of chaos again. About 50, I guess exactly 53 years where you get this Five Dynasties and 10 Kingdoms Period, but then China gets reunified under the Song Dynasty."
Social Studies,"And the Song Dynasty is able to, on some level, pick up where the Tang Dynasty left off. One thing that happens as we get into the late Tang Dynasty, is that there's push-back against Buddhism that we talk about in other videos, and you see Neo-Confucianism begin to take hold and it really takes hold under the Song Dynasty that we talk about in other videos."
Social Studies,"The Song Dynasty is also known as a time of really putting a lot of energy into the civil service and the bureaucracy, and it really being very meritocratic, based on some of these Neo-Confucian ideals. It's also a time of significant technological innovation. The compass, which has use as early as the Han Dynasty, but it really gets into its fairly evolved or modern form, especially for maritime use, during the Song Dynasty."
Social Studies,"The notion of a Chinese junk boat also gets into its evolved form during the Song Dynasty. Some of the really far-reaching innovations from this Dynasty include building on the Tang use of block printing, but thinking about movable type, which makes printing far more practical. And maybe the biggest single innovation that changed the world, for better or worse, was the use of gunpowder, which there's some use in the late Tang, but it really starts to get perfected during the Song Dynasty."
Social Studies,"The Song Dynasty is eventually overthrown in the 13th century by the Mongols. They are able to establish the Yuan Dynasty with Kublai Khan being the first emperor of it, grandson of Genghis, or Jen-gees Khan. They are eventually overthrown in the 14th century by the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty is once again ethnically Han, and some of the most famous attractions that are associated with China today really came about from the Ming Dynasty."
Social Studies,"This is the Forbidden Palace, the imperial residence during the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing. This is the Great Wall of China. And even though the history of the Great Wall of China goes a good ways back, even to the Zhou and Warring States Periods, much of what you now see as the Great Wall, a lot of this brick work, was built during the Ming Dynasty. And then the last true Dynasty of China is the Qing. The Qing Dynasty is again, to some degree, foreign rule."
Social Studies,"It's ruled by the Manchus who come from Manchuria, which is this region right over here, and they're eventually able to overwhelm the Ming Dynasty, and ruled China all the way until the early 20th century when the Republic of China is able to overthrow them.."
Social Studies,"And Confucius, one could say, put them together, but put them together in a contextual way and made them more relevant. And you can see on this diagram, Confucianism was really focused on the ethical, but Confucius himself tried to apply some of his teachings into the more practical realm. Now, out of that hundred schools of thought, you also have Taoism that we talk about in other videos."
Social Studies,"Now, Taoism is really based on this idea of the Tao or the way and we could do many videos on Taoism, but it's this idea of letting go and you could even think of it as going with the flow in a simplicity, a return to nature, freeing yourself from desires, and it was definitely more philosophical and more focused on the spiritual than Confucianism. Now, in other videos, we talk about Legalism, which was a key part of the Chin Dynasty, which was the first real imperial dynasty."
Social Studies,"China is named after the Chin Dynasty, but it was fairly harsh. It was really this idea that hey, human beings really need strong leadership, sometimes harsh leadership, in order for society to actually work. Now, the school of thought that we have here up the top, Buddhism is interesting because it did not emerge from that hundred schools of thought period that we get at the end of the Zhou Dynastic."
Social Studies,"Buddhism emerges in India at around the same time, roughly 2,500 years ago with the teachings of Buddha, a Hindu prince who lived in Northeast India, Southern Nepal, and his teachings are, in some ways, you can almost view as a reformation of Hinduism at the time, a return to the idea that someone through meditation, through realization, can become one with, at least in Buddhism, the emptiness, nirvana, can escape from clinging to desires of this non-reality that we think we live in."
Social Studies,"Now, we've talked about in previous videos how the Chin Dynasty was really based on this Legalist philosophy, but the Han Dynasty is considered the Golden Age of China. Now, under the Han Dynasty, Confucianism really took hold and became the dominant philosophical structure of China and to some degree would stay that way."
Social Studies,"Now, at the end of the Han Dynasty, China goes into a chaotic period for several hundred years until we get to the Sixth Century when the Sui Dynasty is able to finally reunify China for the most part. And in that interim, Confucianism starts to give way, to some degree, to both Taoism and Buddhism, these things that are more focused on the spiritual, areas where Confucianism was not as interested."
Social Studies,"And what's interesting about Buddhism, even though it started in India, famously Ashoka in the Third Century BCE really becomes a patron of Buddhism and even sends missionaries out to spread it and it comes to China via Central Asia and Southeast Asia, it really takes on a uniquely Chinese nature as it enters China. Really, it eventually evolves into Mahayana Buddhism."
Social Studies,"And under the Tang Dynasty, which is considered one of the high points of Chinese civilization, Buddhism is really able to take hold, especially in the early Tang Dynasty. However, as we get into the late Tang Dynasty, Buddhism starts to get some push back and even gets persecuted to some degree. People arguing that hey, Buddhism is a foreign belief system. In some ways, it's not concerned enough with social cohesion."
Social Studies,"It's all about the individual through meditation trying to separate themselves from reality, becoming one with the emptiness. And so at around the same time, someone argue in reaction to the strength of Buddhism."
Social Studies,"You have a movement known as Neo-Confucianism, taking the central ideas of Confucius, but using some frameworks and terminology from Taoism and Buddhism, and there were many Neo-Confucian philosophers that began to emerge in the late Tang Dynasty, but it's really considered the Song Dynasty where Neo-Confucianism really takes hold. And the most famous of the Neo-Confucian philosophers sometimes ranked second to Confucius himself in terms of influence on Chinese philosophy is Zhu Xi."
Social Studies,"He lived from 1130 to 1200 and he's most known for his, one could say, curation of Confucian texts. He famously curated the Four Books, Analects of Confucius, Mencius or The Mencius, by Mencius, Great Learning, Doctrine of the Mean, written by Confucian followers. This curation of Confucian thought shortly after Zhu Xi's life, it becomes the bedrock of the Chinese education system and the civil service examinations as we go through the Yuan, Ming, and Ching Dynasties, all the way to the early 20th Century."
Social Studies,"Now, he also wrote books on tradition and rituals which are, in some ways, very Confucian because they're focused on the practical, they're focused on the family, they're focused on social cohesion. But he also dabbled in the more spiritual, wrote extensively about notions of Taiji which is really a Taoist or even a pre-Taoist idea, thinking about what is the fundamental nature of the universe and the Taiji itself is the great ultimate, sometimes represented by the Yin Yang symbol."
Social Studies,"Really, this is showing Taiji divided into this dualistic nature between Yin and Yang, how at the center of each or the extreme of each, they become the other. He writes about Qi, this life force or energy. And once again, these are ideas he takes from Taoism. But in Neo-Confucian thought, there's this idea of you shouldn't just detach yourself from physical reality, you should study it. There's an order, there's a logic to the universe that could be understood."
Social Studies,"And because of the influence of the Neo-Confucians, especially their focus on belief in an order and logic of the universe, it's no coincidence that the Song Dynasty saw some of the major technological advancements not just of China, but of the world, advancements that really put China at the technological forefront. Remember, Europe at this time is in the Middle Ages. The Middle East is under the Golden Age of Islam, but it's really the Chinese who are pushing the envelope here."
Social Studies,"Let's get a flavor of some of Zhu Xi's writing. Original mind is principle, as derived from Tai Ji, in itself, unmoved, and perfectly good, while physical nature, on the other hand, is principle mixed with material force, qi. It is the aroused state, involving both good and evil. The two natures, however, are always inter-fused, one the substance and the other, function."
Social Studies,"So once again, even though he was Confucian, he was a Confucian philosopher, this is very Taoist in nature and even this notion of talking about original mind is principle in itself, unmoved, and perfectly good, this feels very Buddhist or even Hindu in its thinking."
Social Studies,"Now, one could debate whether it was to what degree it was influenced by Buddhism, it is a very central idea that all of reality, all of sentience, is emergent from this Atman, from this Brahman, from this original mind, emerges from the emptiness. But what makes it Neo-Confucian is beyond the metaphysical, beyond the philosophical, they bring it down to reality. They bring it down to practical concerns."
Social Studies,How does this affect how one governs? How does this affect how one should learn? How does this affect how one should be in social harmony with those around them?.
Social Studies,"But one question is well what allowed all of this innovation to take place? And also what allowed for the stability of the Song dynasty? When you look at it on the timeline like this, that's covering over 2,000 years, it might not look that long but when you actually think about it this is over 300 years of dynastic rule by one dynasty. Now it is split in the middle between the Northern Song and the Southern Song, that happens in 1127, we'll talk about that in a little bit."
Social Studies,"But for the most part, it is a very prosperous time for China. The population actually grows from roughly 50 million people during the Tang dynasty, to, it is estimated, 100 million people by the Northern Song dynasty and eventually keeps growing so that by the time we get to the Ming dynasty, we have a population of about 200 million people."
Social Studies,"So what are the things that allows for that population explosion, really? Well one thing you can imagine is food is very important, and it's during this time period that the Song dynasty is able to leverage a more robust rice seed from Southeast Asia that allows it to feed many, many more people. And so this obviously allows a population growth, but any time you're able to feed people, and there's more prosperity, you're going to have a more stable empire."
Social Studies,"Now another major input into prosperity and the stability of empires is the notion of trade. And China had always many river systems, which helped facilitate agriculture and trade. But as you get into the Sui dynasty, right over here, you have the completion of the Grand Canal, which is even today the largest man-made canal."
Social Studies,"It stretches from Beijing to Hangzhou and actually goes beyond that and has other tributaries and that connected with the existing river systems allowed for a lot of trade to happen, especially as we get into the Tang and Song dynasties. Now the Song dynasty in particular, you have the pound lock being invented, which allows for easier travel across waterways when you have a change in the level of water. The pound lock is still the standard technology used in canals throughout the world."
Social Studies,"You also have the first use of paper money. This is a big deal. We use paper money today. Our ability to have transactions in our society are not dependent on our ability to mine for gold or silver or copper. And one of the things that allowed for paper money to even be used was this notion of block printing, and block printing with movable type in particular. Once again, a Song dynasty innovation."
Social Studies,"Now as I mentioned, as we get into 1127, you have conquerors from the north, in particular the Jin, who are able to conquer Northern China. They caused the Song to move their capital from Kaifeng in the north, to Hangzhou in the south. Here you see Hangzhou is a major southern terminal of the Grand Canal."
Social Studies,"And even though the Northern Song had to move and essentially become the Southern Song dynasty, you continue to have that prosperity for roughly another 150 years and once again, this comes from this meritocracy from the civil service system. This abundance of food, this stability from having the dynastic rule, the trade, the money, all of these technological advances, which make the Song dynasty one of the notable periods of Chinese history.."
Social Studies,"Even though China never conquers Japan, because of how close they are, many things like the idea of a centralized bureaucracy, the Japanese borrow many of these ideas from China during the Classical period."
Social Studies,"In fact, the Japanese rulers sent delegations to China in the 7th century in order to understand all of what the Chinese do, in order to run their government, to run their country, and they start to borrow a lot of the ideas of Buddhism and Confucianism and merge it with some of their own beliefs which are often known as Shinto, which you can view as the original Japanese belief system. So the first part of the Classical period that we're gonna go into some depth is the Heian period."
Social Studies,"Its capital Heian-kyo, modern day Kyoto, and as I mentioned, it was known for taking a lot of these ideas from China and particularly the Tang dynasty in China and bringing them to Japan. The Heian period was known as a golden age of Japan. It was a time of culture, it was a time of architecture, people in the imperial court would focus on the arts, they would focus on philosophy."
Social Studies,"As an example, this right over here is the Byodo-in Temple in Kyoto which shows the level, and this is actually only part of it, it shows the level of cultural advancement of this time."
Social Studies,"As I mentioned, the arts were a big deal and women in the imperial court of Heian China had a lot of influence, in fact, the most influential family, the Fujiwara family maintained its influence by having the emperors marry women from their family and those women would end up having a lot of control over the emperor and of course the next emperor."
Social Studies,"But to get a sense of the arts of this period, here's an excerpt from the Tale of Genji which was written by Lady Murasaki, who was believed to be a member of the Fujiwara family. And Lady Murasaki gets a lot of credit, before Chaucer, before Shakespeare, she is by many historians viewed as the first true novelist that we know of in human history, not just Japanese history."
Social Studies,"But I encourage you to read it, its actually quite riveting, the Tale of Genji, and this is just a small quote from that story or from that novel, it's about a very handsome prince, Genji. ""The difference between enlightenment and confusion ""is of about the same order as the difference ""between the good and the bad in a romance. ""If one takes the generous view, ""then nothing is empty and useless.""."
Social Studies,"And the system that emerges is known as the bakufu system or the shogunate. And Minamoto Yuritomo was the first shogun. So you can see here, the emperor still was there, but the shogun was where all of the power was. And this is really the beginning of medieval Japan. It's the beginning of the Kamakura period, named for where the capital of the Kamakura period was."
Social Studies,"Now what's distinctive about medieval Japan and the bakufu system, is that it becomes much more decentralized than what we had under the Heian period. It's often called a feudal system, because it has parallels to what was going on in Europe at around the same time. Where at the top you had this military ruler, the shogun, and then beneath the shogun you had this decentralized structure of these lords, essentially, that controlled significant regions of Japan. They were called the daimyo."
Social Studies,"And there were roughly 300 daimyo in Japan, roughly county sized districts. And the daimyo, in order conquer land, or to protect their own land, they would support a warrior class known as the samurai. And so they would take their agricultural surplus from their lands, and use that to support this warrior class."
Social Studies,"And this warrior class, the samurai, they were analogous to knights in medieval Europe and just as the knights had chivalry in Europe, the samurai in Japan had bushido which eventually emerges as their code of conduct. Despite that decentralized nature, they were able to fend off invasions from Kublai Khan. So as we've mentioned in other videos in the 1270s, Kublai Khan is conquering much of China and he also attempts to conquer Japan."
Social Studies,"This right over here is a picture of the Mongols shooting arrows at a samurai warrior. Now one of the key factors that keeps Kublai Khan from taking over Japan is on two different occasions as they send their boats from what we now consider to be Korea to Japan they encounter significant storms that destroy most of the boats, and so the Mongols who are able to get to land are significantly depleted and they're pushed back by the samurai warriors."
Social Studies,"Now the Kamakura period continues on until 1333 when there is a brief, only a few years restoration of the power of the emperor, but a few years after that another shogun comes to power and that is Ashikaga Takauji. And this is the beginning now of the Muromachi period. The Muromachi period is often known as the Ashikaga period or the Ashikaga shogunate, but it's named Muromachi for the district of Kyoto at which it had its capital."
Social Studies,"And even though over the course of the Muromachi period the emperor at different points was subsumed into the power of the shogun, this is considered especially the later Muromachi period as one of the more fragmented times of Japanese history. You had many civil wars. You had a lot of internal conflict, and it was only at the end as we get to the end of the 16th Century that Japan gets reunified."
Social Studies,"And one of the key factors that allows it to get reunified is that in the middle of the 16th Century Portuguese traders show up and they introduce guns to Japan. And one daimyo in particular is able to take significant advantage of those guns, and that is Oda Nobunaga."
Social Studies,"Oda Nobunaga as I mentioned was a powerful daimyo, one of these lords who controlled what you could kind of consider to be a county of Japan and using these guns, he's able to put most of the other daimyos, most of the other lords into submission, and he begins to significantly unify Japan. Now he is eventually assassinated and his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi continues to unify Japan even further."
Social Studies,"When he dies, Tokugawa Ieyasu takes power and he's able to consolidate even further and definitively becomes the ruling shogun of Japan. Now even though this period that we're entering, the Edo period and it's named for the castle Edo from which the Tokugawa shogunate ruled, even though this continues to be a shogunate with a shogun in power at the top, the bakufu system, the reason why this is considered the beginning of the modern period or the early modern period is that Japan was finally unified again."
Social Studies,"Now one thing that we will see as we get into the 19th Century, as we get into the end of the Edo period and then you have the Meiji restoration where you have imperial rule again is that Japan is very good at borrowing technology and ideas from other cultures and then making it their own."
Social Studies,"We saw that in the classical period where they imported ideas of Confucianism, Buddhism, imperial government from the Chinese, but adding their own flavor to it and we will see it again as we get into the 19th Century when Japan is one of the first countries not just in Asia, but in the world to truly industrialize by learning many of the technologies that get pioneered in the west.."
Social Studies,"A city-state is a city that is also considers itself a state that has its own political organization, its own way of functioning. It's not dependent on any other government forms, and it's analogous to what we see in classical Greece where we have the city-states of Athens and Sparta. Now what's particularly interesting is what's going on around Lake Texcoco in the 14th Century."
Social Studies,"In 1325 you have the city of Tenochtitlan form on this island in Lake Texcoco and initially Tenochtitlan is one of the weaker city-states around Lake Texcoco. You see many of these city-states, some of the stronger ones you have Texcoco right here, and in particular you have Azcapotzalco, but as we fast forward roughly 100 years, you get to a situation where Azcapotzalco falls into a civil war. Their ruler dies and there's a succession battle and the various city-states around Lake Texcoco take sides."
Social Studies,"What eventually happens is Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan form what is known as a triple alliance or the triple alliance and are able to conquer the Azcapotzalco. And so in conquering the Azcapotzalco, what you have forming is known as the Aztec empire."
Social Studies,"Now it starts as an alliance between these three city-states and other city-states in the area, but over time Tenochtitlan which is sometimes referred to as Mexico Tenochtitlan because it is a city-state of the Mexico people and this is where the name Mexico or Mexico actually comes from."
Social Studies,"Now even though it's an alliance, over time, Tenochtitlan essentially becomes the capital of this alliance, or the capital of this Aztec empire which continues on for roughly 100 years until 1521 when it is defeated by Hernando Cortes."
Social Studies,"Now the story of how Hernando Cortes is able to conquer this empire is fascinating and I'm not going to be able to go into all of the details in this video, but needless to say he's able to convince several hundred conquistadors to come and try to conquer the empire and he's able to do so by recruiting tens of thousands, some estimates I've seen are 100,000 soldiers from neighboring city-states who had issues with the Mexico or with the Aztec empire and so he's eventually able to take over the famed city of Tenochtitlan."
Social Studies,"It's really important to recognize how advanced they were at the time. You see these causeways, these bridges leading into the island. They had a fairly advanced dam system to collect freshwater from the rain while also to control flooding. In fact a lot of that was destroyed when the conquistadors came and Mexico City which eventually gets founded over this lake is going to have issues with flooding for some time in the future."
Social Studies,"In fact the Spanish, in order to control the flooding, end up draining this lake and it's where Mexico City forms. But the big takeaway here is near the end of the Aztec civilization, as we get to the 100 years before the conquistadors arrive, you have this empire form. This empire which starts as an alliance of city-states but eventually becomes a tributary empire. Unlike the neighboring Mayans, which were on the Yucatan peninsula."
Social Studies,"On this map they would be in this region right over here, the neighboring Mayans were autonomous city-states. Some might have had more power, more influence at different times, but the Aztec tributary state means the other city-states are paying tribute to Tenochtitlan."
Social Studies,"They are paying revenue, they are paying service to what essentially is the capital or the seat of that empire until it is conquered by the Spanish with, and remember, the Spanish are able to do this with several hundred conquistadors with the help of neighboring city-states and a smallpox epidemic which kills 50% of the population of the region.."
Social Studies,"But what's interesting is this period of time in the 15th and early 16th centuries, when these empires form, but then shortly thereafter, about a hundred years after they form, they are conquered by the Spanish conquistadors. So let's focus on the Inca Empire, but keep it in comparison to some of the other significant empires and civilizations we know about. As we enter into the 15th century, we have the kingdom of Cuzco. What we now call the Inca Empire did not exist yet."
Social Studies,"The ninth ruler of the kingdom of Cuzco, a gentleman by the name of Pachacuti, he decides to go on a fairly aggressive effort of expansion. It is Pachacuti that takes the Incas from the kingdom of Cuzco, and creates an empire. Now as I mentioned, they did not call themselves the Incas. Inca was actually their word for ruler. So this was Pachacuti Inca. Their name for the empire that gets started by Pachacuti was Tawantinsuyu. What's it's really referring to is the four regions."
Social Studies,"You can see the four regions here that were conquered, with Cuzco at the center. One of the interesting things is that right around the same time, we talk about it in another video, you have the Aztec Empire forming. The Aztec civilization exists well before that, as does the pre-Inca Empire civilizations. But in the 15th century is also when you have the Aztec Empire form. The Mayan civilization, by this point, is in its post-classical period. It's classical period is in bold right over here."
Social Studies,"But there's still many independent Mayan city states in the Yucatan Peninsula. But the two notable empires here are the Aztecs and the Incas, which form in the 15th century. What makes them an empire is that you have one group, in the case of the Incas, the kingdom of Cuzco, conquering other peoples, and taking tribute from them. Now what was interesting about the Incas is that they were able to form this large empire, the largest empire in the Americas at the time of the European conquest."
Social Studies,"This empire had 10 million people in it. What's amazing is that you have this large, powerful empire with significant building projects. This is a picture of Machu Pichu. Historians believe that it was built as an estate for Pachacuti. So they were able to do sophisticated construction despite not having a written system as we know it. They had a system of knots for some forms of record keeping. But despite that, they were able to have a sophisticated society."
Social Studies,"Their way of taxing people was not through formal coinage. They didn't have a monetary system as we know it. Members of their society had to dedicate a proportion of their labor to the empire, to the emperor. This might seem different than what we do, but if you think about it, if my income is taxed at 30% or 35% in, say, the US, essentially what I'm giving to the government is 35% of the work of my labor. I'm just doing it through a monetary system. They did it directly."
Social Studies,"A certain percentage of my labor would directly have to be for the empire. That's how things like Machu Pichu actually got built. This was called the Mit'a system. Well, like the case with the Aztec Empire, the Inca Empire lasts for about 100 years until the Conquistadors come into the picture. Francisco Pizarro in particular, on his third expedition, is able to conquer this powerful Inca Empire. He does this with only several hundred men. But they were far better armed than the Incas."
Social Studies,But many historians believe there was also complacency on the part of the Inca ruler at the time. He didn't believe that these Conquistadors would be able to overtake his army that numbered in the tens of thousands..
Social Studies,"And they've dated this grave and the ring they found in it to somewhere in the 9th century. So somewhere in between the years 800 and 900 or so and we can see in our bigger timeline that that falls right into what's called the viking age and the vikings were people living in Scandinavia and this region shaded in red. They weren't a single political entity, there were a lot of smaller more independent communities, but they shared a lot of cultural characteristics."
Social Studies,"So back to our ring, firstly it's made of silver. Secondly, the bead that's set into it is made of a really high quality glass. And that's of a higher quality that archeologists have found in Scandinavia from this time period. So those two facts would indicate that the ring is probably from somewhere else."
Social Studies,"There's an inscription on the ring, it's kind of hard to see, but if you look closely you can sort of make it out and linguists and archeologists who have looked at this are fairly certain that this is a form of old Arabic script. And they think it says something along the lines of to or for Allah. And I mentioned that the vikings shared a lot of cultural characteristics and one of those characteristics was that they all spoke Norse languages."
Social Studies,So an Arabic inscription on the ring implies really strongly that the ring did not come from Scandinavia. So that should raise the question for you of where did this ring come from and how did it end up in Birka? So the first factor we can look at to try and figure out where this ring came from and how it got here is to look at the political context. The political context at any given time is gonna determine where and what goods are traded.
Social Studies,"So think about it like this, if there are two groups of people and they have a relatively good political relationship it's more likely that they're gonna trade with each other, too. So if we look at the political situation, broadly speaking, during the viking age we have three major empires. The first in purple we have the Byzantine Empire, which was what was left of the Roman empire at this time. We have, in yellow, the Abbasid Caliphate, and this is the Islamic empire that was founded in about 750."
Social Studies,"And then we have, in blue, the Carolingian empire in Europe, and that's named after Charlemagne who in Latin is Carolis Magnus, so Carolingian comes from that. And I should point out on the timeline the Carolingian empire does continue after Charlemagne's death, it just becomes a little bit more fractured politically. Empires tend to have large cities, they can support larger concentrations of people, which means larger concentrations of wealth, which in turn means that there is more demand."
Social Studies,"So cities become attractive to traders because you have a lot of customers in one spot and those imperial cities, especially, tend to concentrate a lot of wealth if they are the seat of government too. So I'm gonna pull our cities onto the map, and as we look around here we can see Aachen is the capital of the Carolingian empire, which is actually geographically quite close to the vikings. We have Constantinople as the Byzantine capital, and then we have Baghdad which is the Abbasid capital down here."
Social Studies,"And when we look at those three empires and those three cities specifically, only one of them speaks Arabic and writes Arabic. And that would be the Abbasid Caliphate. So that would mean that the most likely place of origin for this ring was somewhere in the Abbasid Caliphate in yellow down here. So we want to think about why would the vikings be trading with the empire that's farthest away from them? Well, part of the answer is political."
Social Studies,"So if we look at the relationship between the vikings and the Carolingians, for example, one of Charlemagne's big projects as the ruler of the Carolingian empire was to wage war against and try to convert the Pagans who were living on the northeastern edge of his empire. So there's this ongoing conflict between Charlemagne and non-Christians, including the vikings, and that tends to hurt the potential economic relationships that they could have."
Social Studies,"And you actually see the vikings raid the coast of the Carolingian empire in the ninth century, as well. So the vikings are trading with the Byzantines and with the Abbasids, what they're engaging in is what we call long distance trade. So when we talk about long distance trade, what we usually see are luxury goods. And luxury goods are goods that are rare and expensive."
Social Studies,"And so in all of these empires what we see is the political context, the fact that they have large powerful empires, makes it likely that they have more advanced technology which means that they're able to produce higher quality, more technologically advanced, goods."
Social Studies,"But then we have to ask what do the vikings have that they would be trading with these more advanced empires? Well one thing we can point out here is that the vikings in Scandinavia are in a very different climate than we have down in the Byzantine empire, in the Abbasid Caliphate, and to a certain extent, different than even what the Carolingians have, although we pointed out some of the political issues prevented more trade from occurring between them."
Social Studies,"And the point we could make about the different climates is that climates determine what resources are available. So if we look at what the vikings are trading, we see things that are somewhat unique to their climate. And when we talk about the viking traders, a lot of what they're doing is actually coming across the Baltic Sea into this region here, the Baltic region, we call that and they are obtaining goods such as timber. And specifically the timber they want are from pine trees."
Social Studies,"And pines in the Baltic tend to grow very tall and straight and that makes them really attractive for building material. Also, it's much colder in this climate and animals, fur-bearing mammals, especially will tend to grow nicer thicker coats if they live in cold climates and that makes them more attractive then as potential clothing items. Another resource we see frequently in the Baltic region is amber, and that is dried tree resin."
Social Studies,"And that can be polished and shaped into stones for jewelry, for decoration, as well. And the vikings also do engage in the slave trade. They'll kidnap and take people from this region and then trade them as slaves with these imperial capitals, that is not something that's necessarily influenced by the environment, but it is also a part of this trade. Some of the most popular items that the vikings are trading for are things like fabrics, especially silk, which is produced in these empires."
Social Studies,"I also mentioned glass earlier. We saw the glass inset in the ring, they also are making glass vessels like drinking glasses. You can see a picture of one here. And that is gonna be of a much better quality than anything that the vikings are able to produce. So that glass becomes an attractive technology. There's a lot of silver coming out of, especially, the Abbasid Caliphate."
Social Studies,"One of the reasons that they know this trade was occurring more broadly is that in the Baltic region and along some of the travel routes between the Baltic and the Abbasid Caliphate archeologists have found hordes, or large collections, of silver Abbasid coins. And so we see here both silver and glass, the elements of that ring that we discovered, are things that are being traded for by the vikings coming from this region."
Social Studies,So we see the climate impacting to a certain extent what goods exist in different regions. So there's an environmental impact there. We also see geography or environment affecting the transportation of goods. So what I want to do next is pull in the commonly used trade routes at this time. And this helps us to understand how these goods actually move between these places. So we see that the major trade routes between the Baltic region and the Byzantines and the Abbasids follow major river systems.
Social Studies,"And the vikings are able to take advantage of these river systems in part because of the technology that they possess. So again we see the environment playing a role in trade and determining what routes are convenient to transport goods. And one other point I would make about these routes that develop is we see these cities of Novgorod, of Kiev, and of Bulgar that pop along these trade routes and these cities sort of grow because the trade routes exist."
Social Studies,"These cities themselves become center of trade over time. So to come back to our ring that we started the video with, hopefully this is looking less like an anomaly, a strange find, and more like the natural result of the existing trade networks that were in in place because of the environmental and because of the political conditions at this time.."
Social Studies,"And what's interesting about Sub-Saharan Africa from a linguistic or language perspective is that when you look at Sub-Saharan Africa in terms of language families, the majority of people in most of Sub-Saharan Africa speak a Bantu language. And archeologists and linguists who study the spread of the Bantu languages know that the Bantu language probably originated somewhere here in West Africa."
Social Studies,"So the question that arises from this is, how did this language spread throughout so much of Sub-Saharan Africa? Well, one problem we have when we try to answer that question is that we don't have written records. These languages were not written down at the time that the actual migrations and expansion occurred. But one thing that Bantu-speaking cultures had in common was that they knew how to make and use iron tools and weapons."
Social Studies,"And fortunately for archeologists, iron tools and weapons tend to hold up fairly well. So they can find these sites where Bantu speakers lived, and they can date the artifacts that they find, and from that they can get a sense of when various Bantu-speaking groups showed up in different parts of Africa, and then from there we can kind of trace the spread. And it looks something like this. And the fact that Bantu speakers had these iron tools and weapons is one of the causes of their expansion."
Social Studies,"From a military standpoint, if you have iron weapons and the people you are fighting against do not, you're gonna have a really big advantage. They also were able to make agricultural implements, or tools, out of iron. These were stronger, they were more durable, they were better for working with, which helped the Bantu speakers produce more and better food. And more and better food causes increased population growth."
Social Studies,"And as a population grows in a particular area, that puts more pressure on the resources to feed this population, and that in turn forces people to start to look for new places to migrate to. And I mentioned a little earlier that the Bantu speakers were farmers. And they were growing things like millet and sorghum, and later on they started to raise cattle as well. And what these crops and cattle have in common is that they all tend to do well in what's called a tropical, or a sub-tropical savanna climate."
Social Studies,"And when you look at Sub-Saharan Africa, a lot of Sub-Saharan Africa is a tropical or sub-tropical savanna climate. So if we look at our spread of Bantu-speaking people in Africa, we see that it actually lines up pretty well with the areas of Africa that have this same climate. So we can see the climate of Sub-Saharan Africa, or at least much of Sub-Saharan Africa, that aligned with Bantu agricultural practices as being another cause of the Bantu expansion."
Social Studies,"So we know that causes also have effects, and we wanna think about what were the effects of the Bantu migration on Sub-Saharan Africa? Well that first point I made about it was that even today, many many people in Sub-Saharan Africa speak some Bantu language. Now there are several hundred Bantu languages, but they are all related and it does go back to this initial expansion of Bantu speakers. So that's one effect of the migration on Sub-Saharan Africa."
Social Studies,"The Bantu speakers also brought the iron-working technology that they had with them as they expanded, and so one other effect was that iron-working technology spread throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. And finally, they were bringing new crops and new farming practices into regions where they moved, and this had some effects on the landscape. When you're actively farming an area that's going to look different than people who are living a hunting and gathering lifestyle."
Social Studies,"The second human migration I want to look at in this video is that of people into the Pacific Islands. And I have a map here that shows the most likely route of expansion that people followed as they moved into the islands of the Pacific over time. And when we look at the Pacific Islands, the obvious obstacle to travel there is that there is a lot of open ocean, and these islands are very small and oftentimes far apart."
Social Studies,"So, one of the ways that people were able to travel and migrate across the pacific had to do with technology. Specifically, the technology that people had in the Pacific Islands were sailing canoes. And I have an image here, this is a modern recreation of a sailing canoe, but it gives us a sense of what these vessels would have looked like. And you can see that the two hulls and the sail are gonna let it be a little more sturdy, they're gonna let it take advantage of the winds to travel across the ocean."
Social Studies,"So having this technology was one of the things that allowed people to actually physically move across the Pacific Ocean. So now we need to think about why were people trying to travel across the Pacific Ocean? Well, similar to the forces that caused the Bantu migration in Sub-Saharan Africa, in the Pacific Ocean we also had population pressures. And in the Pacific, we have a lot of small islands. So population pressure becomes an issue a lot quicker at a lot lower population than it did in Africa."
Social Studies,"We see population pressure as a major cause of migration in the Pacific. And because a lot of islands in the Pacific Ocean don't produce a lot of natural foodstuffs that people can eat, these people who were migrating in the Pacific had to bring food with them. So they would bring plants with them, they would bring things like taro roots or yams, and these were plants that they knew would grow well in these island environments. They also brought animals with them."
Social Studies,"So, chickens, and this is an image of a Southeast Asian jungle fowl, and these were the precursors to domestic chickens. They also brought pigs, and a breed of small dogs. And the dogs were not hunting dogs, the dogs were a source of food. And rats also tended to tag along on these trips."
Social Studies,"So, you have people moving to these islands, and most of them are fairly small ecosystems and environments, and they bring these new plants and these new animals, and this has some major effects on the environments where they choose to live. I already mentioned with the Bantu migration that bringing agriculture to new regions can have some impacts on the landscape, and in the case of migration in the Pacific, the animals have even more impact."
Social Studies,"So the rats, for example, tend to eat bird eggs, as well as get into and eat people's food. And the pigs also compete with people for food. The pigs are supposed to be a source of food for people, but pigs do fairly well if left to their own devices, and they became a competing population with people for food resources. And there's actually a story from one island in about the year 1600, they ended up killing all their pigs because the pigs were causing too much damage to the rest of their food supply."
Social Studies,"And generally, the people on these islands would find a balance between producing food and helping a population they could support without destroying the island environment, but there were some cases where islands were nearly destroyed because of the effects of human populations living there. Most famously, the example of Easter Island, which is off the coast of Chile. If you have some time to look up that story, it's an interesting example of the impacts that humans can have on an environment."
Social Studies,"But to summarize, we see a couple common causes of migration. And in both cases, in Africa and in the Pacific, we see that pressures on food resources cause people to look for new places to live. We also see that technologies allow people to move into new environments. And on the effects side, we see that when people move to new environments, that's going to have impacts on the places that they move to. People are going to bring new plants and new animals, and that's gonna have some environmental impacts."
Social Studies,"And people are also gonna bring new cultures and new ideas to regions as well. So hopefully this can provide you a framework for understanding other migrations that you might look at, in that you can think about what is causing people to move? And once people do move, what impacts does that have?."
Social Studies,"It's occurring during the high middle ages. In other videos we saw the first crusades start at the end of the 11th century, started really by Pope Urban the second with the purported reason to help the Byzantines take land from the Muslims, especially the Holy Land. The first crusade is for the most part successful but they don't return that land to the Byzantines."
Social Studies,"They set up what are known as Crusader States or Crusader Kingdoms including the Kingdom of Jerusalem and just to read this timeline that I drew up here, green shows a time period when at least Jerusalem is controlled by the Muslims. Red shows when Jerusalem is controlled by Western European powers or by these Crusader Kingdoms which were essentially Western European. These red parts on our timeline show when the actual crusades occurred."
Social Studies,"So you see the first crusade causes the change of control of Jerusalem from the Muslims to the Western European Christians and once Jerusalem was under their control and it would continue to be under their control for roughly 90 years, you could imagine that many pilgrims from Europe went to the holy sites in the Holy Land especially in Jerusalem, but this was not an easy journey."
Social Studies,"Not only was it a long journey, these are the paths that I showed in previous videos that the crusaders took, but this could also be the paths that many of the pilgrims took in order to go to the Holy Land and you could imagine a journey of this distance going through multiple kingdoms in this time period could be incredibly dangerous and many of the pilgrims actually were robbed or sometimes worse on their way to the Holy Land."
Social Studies,"So in 1119 a small group of Knights led by Hughes de Payens, they go to King Baldwin the second, King of Jerusalem. Remember they set up this crusader state, the Kingdom of Jerusalem headquartered on the temple mount and these knights tell King Baldwin the second and Warmund, or Patriarch Warmund the Patriarch of Jerusalem, they say we would like to protect these pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem."
Social Studies,"These guys think it is a good idea and so in 1120 they give them some space, a headquarters on the temple mount in order to start their group. If you translate the Latin version of their name it translates to Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon."
Social Studies,"Now the reason why it says and the Temple of Solomon is because they were headquartered on the temple mount and the Al-Aqsa Mosque is believed by many to be on the site of the original Temple of Solomon, but this is often shortened to the Knights Templar. This is their symbol, two knights riding on a horse to show their poverty, but they don't stay poor for long. They are shortly thereafter recognized by the Pope and many people start donating money to this order."
Social Studies,Many more people volunteer to be Knights Templar and so over the remainder of the crusades they become an important institution in Medieval Europe. Now most folks often associate the Knights Templar with being Knights. You can see here one of the Knights on horseback. Here you see the Knights protecting pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem and they did do that.
Social Studies,"They did protect the pilgrims and they were also active in battle during the crusades thereafter, but it turns out that even though on the peak there were on the order of 20,000 Knights Templar, only about 10% of them were actual soldiers, were actually these warrior monks as they're sometimes called."
Social Studies,The rest of the Templars created this fairly significant complex infrastructure to do multiple things to support the goal of the Knights Templar and perhaps most significantly they developed a sprawling financial enterprise of the time.
Social Studies,"If you were in London and you wanted to do a pilgrimage to the Holy Land you would need resources in order to do that and you would want to have access to your wealth once you got to Jerusalem and so you could imagine if you were traveling over a long journey to take gold coins with you, not only would they be heavy but more importantly it would be dangerous."
Social Studies,"A lot of people might want to take that gold from you and so one of the services that the Knights Templar developed was that you could go to their temple in London essentially deposit your money, they'll give you a note of credit saying that, we the Knights owe you a certain amount of money, and then you make your journey and when you get to Jerusalem you can give that note to the Knights there and they will give you your money. Now this is something that we take for granted today."
Social Studies,"I can go to an ATM machine anywhere in the world and for the most part I can put in my ATM card and get access to money, but there's a lot of infrastructure that makes that happen. Today we have telecommunications, we have satellites that help information go back and forth, we have servers that keep track of all of that data."
Social Studies,They didn't have that in the middle ages and so you can imagine this is a very powerful idea that I could deposit money one place and then I could withdraw it someplace else and we still don't fully understand how the knights were able to pull this off.
Social Studies,"It requires a lot of trust and how were they able to authenticate the notes of credit at any of these points? Not only did they do this type of deposit and withdrawal in multiple locations, they also because they had all of these deposits and people were also donating money to them just to support their cause, they were able to provide loans. Often times loans to very powerful individuals like kings and nobility. They were often brokers in major transactions."
Social Studies,This is the reason why historians really do consider them perhaps the first true international bank.
Social Studies,"In other videos we talk about how in 1187 Saladin is able to retake Jerusalem but then in the Sixth Crusade and the Barons' Crusades it goes back to Christian hands but then 1244 it's retaken again by the Muslims and it stays under Muslim control all the way until the end of World War One and so with Jerusalem taken in 1244 the whole goal of the Knights Templar, the whole purpose of their existence starts to become less important."
Social Studies,"Although at this point they are a significant and influential financial institution. As we go to the end of the 13th century the whole crusader mentality starts to lose steam. You have the Eighth and Ninth Crusades but they aren't successful and as we get into the early 14th century you have this character Philip the Fourth, King of France and he has incurred a lot of debt in order to have wars especially with England and a good bit of this financing comes from the Knights Templar."
Social Studies,"He is a powerful man looking for solutions to his debt situation and he realizes one solution is maybe just to arrest the people who you owe money to and then not only do you not owe any money to them, but you can seize their assets and Philip the fourth does exactly that. Famously on a Friday the 13th in 1307 he arrests many Knights Templars including the Grand Master, the leader of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay. He tortures them."
Social Studies,"They eventually confess to a whole bunch of things but then they retract that confession and they're not willing to retract the retraction and so in 1314 Jacques de Molay as well as other Knights Templar, especially in the leadership, who do not agree to those confessions are burned at the stake in Paris and this is considered the end of the Knights Templar although there are many legends of how they have continued on perhaps in secrecy. So the Knights Templar are to this day are a subject of fascination."
Social Studies,"There's many legends associated with them, but one of their biggest historical contributions that isn't often talked about but we know happened, is that they really laid the foundation for what we today consider modern international banking.."
Social Studies,"So in 1598 a fleet of ships left the Netherlands to trade. So these are Dutch ships. And one of the sailors on this fleet of ships is an Englishman named William Adams. This fleet of ships sails down the coast of Africa. They stop off West Africa here, they trade as many European ships would do at this time. Then they sailed around South America and ended up off the coast of Peru."
Social Studies,"And at this point William Adams started keeping a journal, and he tells us, it was agreed that we should leave the coast of Peru and direct our course for Japan. Having understood that cloth was good merchandise there and also how upon that coast of Peru the king's ships were out seeking us. And the king that Adams was referring to here is the king of Spain."
Social Studies,"Peru is a Spanish colony at this time, and the fleet which again is from the Netherlands is worried about this because the Netherlands are at war with Spain. The Netherlands are rebelling against Spanish rule at this time. And this is evidence for a couple of points that illustrate again how interconnected the world economy was. First, they know about Japan, and they know how to get there. Second, they also have some idea of what kind of merchandise might be valuable to try and trade in Japan."
Social Studies,"So they do sail to Japan, they make it there, and they end up as prisoners of the Japanese emperor. And while they're prisoners in Japan, there are Portuguese priests also living in Japan who are trying to convince the Japanese emperor that he should execute these Dutch and English sailors as pirates. The emperor decides that he's not going to execute them."
Social Studies,"If they wanna trade and he wants what they have to trade, they can trade, and then he forces William Adams, the Englishman, to stay and help his navy build ships. And this is how Adams ends up in a position where he can help the English open up trade with Japan a few years later. And I mentioned early on that Portugal was one of the major contributors to this new global economy, and we see in Adams' story that there are Portuguese priests in Japan in the year 1600."
Social Studies,"So that raises the question of, how did these Portuguese priests end up in Japan? Well to understand that, we actually jump back to the beginning of our timeline when in 1498 a Portuguese sailor named Vasco da Gama made it around the south coast of Africa and sailed to the Indian city of Calicut, and this was the beginning of the Portuguese Empire in the Indian Ocean and the East Indies."
Social Studies,"And historians who study the Portuguese Empire oftentimes will call it a trading post empire, and what they mean by that is that the Portuguese did not try to actively conquer large chunks of territory. Instead they would find existing trading centers and try to insert themselves into those trade networks. So they would set up trading posts or factories, and there's a drawing here from the late 1500s from the city of Calicut showing the Portuguese factory."
Social Studies,"It's the building here that looks like a castle sitting in the existing city. And these aren't factories like we think of in the Industrial Revolution where they're making things in them. These factories are really more like warehouses where they store goods until the ships can come and pick them up. So the Portuguese are expanding their trading post empire in the Indian Ocean and the East Indies, and in 1542, the government of China grants them the right to trade from the island of Macau."
Social Studies,"And one of the things that China really wants is silver, and they want silver because they have paper money and they want silver to back up the paper currency so that it maintains its value. And Japan produces silver. So the Portuguese end up trading Chinese porcelain and silk with Japan in exchange for silver that they then bring back to China. And another thing the Portuguese bring along with trade goods is religion in the form of priests and missionaries."
Social Studies,"And hopefully at this point you see how Portuguese priests might have ultimately ended up in Japan by the time that William Adams and his crew landed there. And while all this is going on in the Eastern Hemisphere, Spain is building a huge colonial empire in the Americas. And when we see a colonial empire, we mean that they are sending Spanish colonists to live in these conquered territories and expand Spanish influence."
Social Studies,"And it becomes large enough and populous enough that Spain has to set up colonial governments, and in 1535 they create The Viceroyalty of New Spain in this area. It's named for a Viceroy, literally a vice king or someone who is in place of the king, to rule over that colony on his behalf. And then in 1542, they create the Viceroyalty of Peru in this area, which is the same Peru that William Adams was referring to in his diary from 1600."
Social Studies,"And in these Spanish viceroyalties, plantations are one major source of wealth. And a plantation is essentially a large farm that produces crops that are very valuable that can be exported and sold for high profits. The other major source of wealth in the Americas was mining, and especially silver mining. Because in the mid 1540s at Zacatecas in modern day Mexico and at Potosi in modern day Bolivia, the Spanish find giant deposits of silver, some of the largest silver deposits in the world."
Social Studies,"And this has two major impacts on this global economy that is starting to form. So the first impact we wanna highlight is is that on labor in the Americas. So maintaining and operating plantations and mines is really brutal hard work, to the point where people will die doing this kind of work. And the Spanish who are colonizing the area were not doing this work on their own. And on top of this they're increasing production in plantations and in mines so they just need more and more labor."
Social Studies,"So they start to turn to enslaved African workers. So in terms of our globally connected economy that's developing, what we see now is West Africa is brought even more into these trading networks and relationships with the Spanish and the Portuguese. Prior to this point, West Africa was a trading area for the Portuguese and for the Spanish, especially for things like gold and ivory and certain spices, but now West Africa also became a place where the Spanish and the Portuguese would buy enslaved workers."
Social Studies,"And this had some major effects on West African economies. Not only were there more and more European goods coming into these places, there were also some West African societies that restructured their economies around capturing and selling slaves as the demand for enslaved workers grew. The other major impact of these silver discoveries in terms of creating this global economy had to do with that silver trade that the Portuguese were carrying out between Japan and Ming China."
Social Studies,"At this point and time Ming China was the largest state, the largest empire, in terms of population in the world, so despite the distance and the risks involved, Spain was now looking for a way to get to China to trade this silver. In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan had claimed the Philippines for Spain."
Social Studies,"Spain didn't colonize them at the time, but in 1565 the Spanish sent a group of colonists to settle in the Philippines and from this venture, part of this group ends up figuring out how they can sail across the Pacific Ocean from the Philippines to New Spain, modern day Mexico. And this opens up what becomes the galleon trade in the Pacific."
Social Studies,"A galleon is a large sailing ship, and it's really useful for long distance trade because it's big and it can hold a lot of cargo, and it also carries guns to defend itself."
Social Studies,"So from the 1570s forward, you now have a regular trade going on where silver from the Americas is being shipped to Manila in the Philippines where it's traded on to Chinese traders for things like porcelain and silk, and then those goods are shipped back to the Americas to the port of Acapulco where they're transported across land, loaded onto ships along with other silver that's been mined and sent back to Spain."
Social Studies,"So the final piece of this global economy really falls into place in 1580 with the Iberian Union. And the Iberian Union refers to a time when the king of Spain also became the king of Portugal, and Spain and Portugal are on the Iberian Peninsula so that's where we get Iberian Union. At this point we know that Portugal had a really large global empire with lots of trade, Spain had a large global empire with lots of trade, and now both of those empires are ruled by the same king."
Social Studies,"So all of these trade networks become essentially part of the same empire. Now we have this situation where demand for silver in Europe and in China is having impacts on labor systems in the Americas, which in turn is having impacts on populations in West Africa."
Social Studies,"And to go back to the beginning of our story, this deeply interconnected global trade network is also the reason that by the year 1600, we can see an Englishman sail to Japan with a Dutch fleet and run into a group of Portuguese priests while he's there. Another way to think about this is that William Adams' story was only possible because of what Spain and Portugal did throughout the 16th century to create these long distance trade networks.."
Social Studies,"What was powerful about this is it challenged centuries old ideas about how the universe worked and at a meta level, it was about using new methods and evidence in order to make conclusions no matter how revolutionary those conclusions might be. And this publication is often cited as the beginning of what will be known as the scientific revolution. Many people view the capstone of the scientific revolution to be Newton's publication of Principia in 1687 and this is an incredibly powerful publication."
Social Studies,"It describes the laws of the universe, it's a universe in which most things can be explained with simple principles, with mathematics. This is so powerful that it would not be challenged for over 200 years until Albert Einstein comes on the scene with his theories of relativity."
Social Studies,"But even today, Newton's laws, this is what is taught in a first year physics class, this is what you learn in an introductory engineering class, so there's many things to think about, why did this happen at this period of time, how was it related to the Renaissance, how was it related to things that were happening in politics in Europe at the time? But needless to say, it gave humanity a new perspective on the universe and it gave humanity new powers and we began to challenge all assumptions and so as we get into the late 1600s and early 1700s, people start trying to use these same tools, the same deductive reasoning on some of the oldest questions that humanity has ever asked itself, questions like, what rights do we have as human beings? Who gets those rights? What duty and obligation do we have towards each other? What is the role of government? Who has the right to rule? Now some of these questions have been the fodder of philosophers and religion for thousands of years."
Social Studies,"But now there was the power and the tools and the challenging notions of the scientific revolution. And this philosophical movement that is really tied to the scientific revolution is known as the Enlightenment. And just to have an example of the thinking during the Enlightenment, here is a passage from John Locke who is considered one of the pillars of the Enlightenment. This is published in 1689, it's the Second Treatise Concerning Civil Government."
Social Studies,"""The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges everyone and reason, which is that law,"" so reason is the law of nature to govern it, ""teaches all mankind who will but consult it ""that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm ""another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions."
Social Studies,"""And when his own preservation comes not in competition, ""ought he as much as he can to preserve the rest of mankind ""and may not unless it be to do justice on an offender, ""take away or impair the life or what tends ""to the preservation of the life, the liberty, health, ""limb or goods of another."" Now to parse what he's saying, he says that reason is this natural law that should govern human action and he's saying no one ought to harm anyone else and that if we're not in competition, maybe there's only enough food for one of us and there's two of us there, in which case we'd be in competition, but if there isn't that competition, we should be trying to help each other and we should be trying to preserve the rest of mankind."
Social Studies,"And unless it's for the purpose of justice, you don't have the right to take away or impair the life or things that help preserve the life, the liberty, the health, limb, or goods of another. Now you might say, hey, isn't this common sense? And religions for all of time have touched on some of these issues but you also have to appreciate that this is a time when kings and emperors ruled the world."
Social Studies,"What gave them that right? Why are certain people slaves and other people not slaves? Why do certain people in that world have a right to own these other people? And so this was a very controversial idea, challenging some of these fundamental notions of who should rule, who has the right to rule, and to what degree should people exert control over one another, so given these challenging notions of the Enlightenment, and John Locke was only one of the actors who would figure prominently in this roughly 100-year period, it's no surprise that as you get into the late 1700s and early 1800s, you have a whole string of revolutions, especially in the Americas, to a large degree inspired by the ideas of the Enlightenment, things like life, liberty, health, in the United States Declaration of Independence, these things are cited."
Social Studies,"During the French Revolution, these things are cited. In the various revolutions in Latin America, these ideas are cited. Now one of the reasons why the Enlightenment came about when it did, not only did we have new tools of thinking and the opportunity to challenge notions, but it might have been that society now had the responsibility to think a little bit deeper about these ideas because it was getting more and more powers through the scientific revolution."
Social Studies,"And those powers were becoming even more significant when that science was applied during the Industrial Revolution. Now society could produce more than it could ever produce before, but as we talk about in other videos, the Industrial Revolution had a certain hunger for raw materials and a certain hunger for markets in which to sell your finished product."
Social Studies,"It also allowed for more powerful weapons and ways to project power and to control a larger empire, methods of communication, methods of force, and many historians tie it directly to the age of imperialism where especially Western European powers sought areas to get raw materials and markets in which they could push their finished products and so as the industrialized world had more and more power, these ideas of the Enlightenment became maybe even more relevant even though they might not have been implemented consistently during the age of imperialism."
Social Studies,"And as we've seen in other videos, even though the technology keeps accelerating during the Industrial Revolution, the philosophy and the moral framework does not accelerate along with it and in 20th century, we see one of the bloodiest centuries in all of human history, so let me leave you with a final series of questions."
Social Studies,"As we go into the 1800s, we talked about the various independence movements especially in the Americas, we also have the abolishing of slavery in most of the world around this time period and so to some degree, it looks like the ideas of the Enlightenment are coming to be, but at the exact same time, you have the age of imperialism, where more and more control is exerted over people around the planet. This all comes to a head in World War I, which is one of the bloodiest conflicts in all of human history."
Social Studies,"So to what degree did the Enlightenment help the world and to what degree did it not get fulfilled? Or maybe in some way, things like World War I and World War II were the birthing pangs, the transition state, from the world before the Enlightenment, then how close are we truly to those ideals today? In a future video, I'm gonna talk about that and I'm gonna talk about the idea of human rights and how we as a civilization have attempted to address it after World War II.."
Social Studies,"Now over the next few decades, he tries to consolidate control, he tries to take control of Samarkand, loses control and then of Fergana, keeps repeatedly losing control. Early in the 16th century, he is able to take Kabul and then decides to focus on India instead of central Asia."
Social Studies,"In 1526, famously with the use of cannons, which had not been used in a significant way in the Indian subcontinent until that time, Babur was able to defeat Ibraham Lodi of the Delhi sultanate and come to power in northern India and you can see in this blue gray color, this is the territory that Babur was able to rule over until his death in 1530. Moghul is the Persian word for Mongol. Remember, Babur is a descendant of Timur, who is a Turko-Mongolian conqueror."
Social Studies,"On his mother's side, he claims descendancy from Gengis Khan, but Persian is the language of his court and so it significantly increases the Persian influence in North Indian culture. After his death, his son Humayun comes to power. Humayun has difficult retaining power. He has various family rivalries to contend with and eventually he is dethroned by the Pashtun Suri dynasty."
Social Studies,"He goes to the Safavids and with their help, is able to retake control but then trips on stairs and dies and then his son Akbar comes to power. Now Akbar is perhaps most famous of all of the Moghul rulers. As you can see, he is able to rule over India for some time. As just mentioned, Humayan essentially had to reconquer, retake the throne and his hold on power was relatively weak. But now Akbar is able to expand the territory that you see in this light purple mauve color."
Social Studies,"He's able to increase the central authority and perhaps most importantly, he tries to unify India culturally. The Moghuls are Muslim and are relatively tolerant up through Akbar and to some degree, Jahangir, of other religions, but Akbar takes a very pluralistic approach. He's famous for holding court with religious scholars throughout the empire and even trying to merge the religions, creating what some would consider a religion of his own that would later be called Din-i-Illahi, the religion of god."
Social Studies,"Many Jain and Hindu principles appealed to him. He becomes a vegetarian, he bans the slaughtering of cows. At his death in 1605, his son Jahangir comes to power. Historians consider Jahangir to be relatively tolerant like Akbar and to continue the interest in the sciences and the arts that you saw in the Moghul court under Akbar but he's a little bit more controversial. As we talked about in the Sikhism video, he famously tortures and executes Guru Arjan."
Social Studies,"Some would say it was because Guru Arjan was siding with Jahangir's son, who was trying to rebel. Others would say that it was because Guru Arjan was getting a following in Punjab and that Jahangir was insecure of his own hold on power and decided to execute Guru Arjan. But he is succeeded by his son, Shah Jahan, who becomes decisively less tolerant."
Social Studies,"His reign, however, is known as the golden age of Moghul architecture, with the crowning achievement, arguably, the Taj Mahal, which is a mausoleum that he commissions in the 1630s to house the body of his dead wife. As you can see here, it's housed in Agra and Agra and Delhi at various points during the Moghul empire are the capital, there's a few moments when it is at Lahore. He is eventually imprisoned by his son, Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb is considered a very strong and authoritarian ruler."
Social Studies,"You can see here that he is able to expand the territory of the Moghul empire well into South India. At its maximum extent, the Moghul empire is now rivaling the amount of territory that was controlled by the Moria empire, roughly 2000 years before this time. Despite being the last truly strong Moghul emperor, he's also known as the least tolerant of the emperors. After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, he's succeeded by weaker and weaker Moghul rulers."
Social Studies,"The 18th century, you see a significant decline in the power of the Moghuls, the territory they have. Delhi is famously sacked by Nadir Shah, the Persian conqueror. As we get into the second half of the 18th century, the British are able to chip away more and more and more territory, not just from the Moghuls, but from other Indian rulers as well, which we will see in future videos.."
Social Studies,"As you might remember from previous videos, as we entered into the 13th century, you have Genghis Khan or Genghis Khan take over much of Asia from Mongolia. But by the time you get to 1300, the empire has fragmented into these various khanates. The Yuan Dynasty in China, Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, the Golden Horde in Northwest Asia, and the Ilkhanate in Persia and the Middle East."
Social Studies,"Now, two things to keep note of as we look at this map that are relevant to this video is notice this tiny little kingdom right over here. This is one of the many fragmented kingdoms that result after the Sultanate of Rum collapses in the middle of the 13th century. This kingdom in particular is founded by someone by the name of Osman, or the Arabic version of the name would be Uthman or Othman. And so this is the nascent Ottoman empire forming right over here."
Social Studies,"And over here you have the Delhi Sultanate, which was the first significant Muslim empire over in North India. And notably, they were one of the few empires that were able to fend off the Mongols. But now let's fast forward roughly 100 years. Now a few things have changed. The Ming Dynasty has taken over the Yuan Dynasty in the middle of the 14th century. The Mongols in the east are now relegated to the Northern Yuan Dynasty, but there still is the Chagatai Khanate and the Golden Horde."
Social Studies,"But much of their territory, including the Ilkhanate, has now been taken over by Timur, who we talk about in previous videos. And Timur famously sacked Delhi and really brought the Delhi Sultanate to its knees and as we will see, it will only last for roughly another 100 years. Now, you might also notice that the Ottoman empire, founded by Osman or Othman is continuing to grow and continuing to conquer. Now one thing to keep in mind."
Social Studies,"In previous videos, we talk about the invention of gunpowder in Tang China and the early Song dynasty, which was about four to five hundred years before the period that we're talking about right now. But as we get into this period, we are now starting to see the use of gunpowder for guns and in particular artillery. And when I say artillery, think cannons. So let's fast forward another 200 years to see how the empires of Asia have evolved. So now we see several things."
Social Studies,"The Ming Dynasty is still in control of much of China. The Northern Yuan are still in Mongolia. You have a Kazakh Khanate, descendant from the Mongols. By the late 16th and early 17th century the Ottoman Empire has now expanded significantly, encompassing much of the Middle East. In Persia, you see that the Timurid Empire fell within a few decades after the death of Timur. And as we enter into the 16th century, you have the Safavid Dynasty take over."
Social Studies,"And then also in the 16th century, almost coincident with the founding of the Safavid Dynasty in Persia, you have Timur's grandson's great-grandson, Babur, who's born in current-day Uzbekistan, is able to defeat the Delhi Sultanate and establish the Mughal Empire. And Mughal is just the Persian word for Mongol and Babur is a direct descendant of Timur on his father's side and of Genghis Khan on his mother's side."
Social Studies,"Now, many historians often group these three empires or dynasties together because they do share some commonalities. And so let's think about each of them individually and think about where they are similar and where they are different. Not a lot is known about Osman who founds that first kingdom in the Anatolian peninsula. It's a Sunni Islamic empire. In fact, the leader is eventually named a caliph. The ruling class of this empire is Turkish."
Social Studies,"Now, one of their distinguishing characteristics is what's known as the Devshirme system in which the Sultan, the Emperor, would have a personal army of what could be called slaves, these Janissaries. These Janissaries were actually Christian boys taken at a young age and then indoctrinated into the Janissary system."
Social Studies,"The reason why I said you can kind of call them slaves is that although they were forced to become Janissaries and taken from their families, they were given many privileges and over time, many of these Janissaries became some of the most notable figures in the Ottoman Empire, some of them even becoming the Grand Vizier, effectively ruling over the empire. Now, the Ottomans are also known for one of the earliest empires to very successfully to use gunpowder in battle."
Social Studies,"The Safavids, as you can see here, were really founded in the very early 16th century, officially 1501, by their founder Shah Ismail, sometimes known as Ismail I. And he is the heir to a religious dynasty, the Safavias. It is a Muslim dynasty, like the Ottoman Empire, but unlike the Ottoman Empire, it is based on Twelver Shia Islam. Twelver Shia is the major group of Shias today and it is based on the belief of 12 imams following Mohammed starting with Ali and we have videos on the Sunni-Shia split."
Social Studies,"Now, even though Ismail spoke Turkish and was raised in a Turkic society, this dynasty brought back much of the culture of Ancient Persia. In fact, it's viewed as the first dynasty since the Sassanids that actually had native Persian rule and brought back that Persian culture, part of which is using the word Shah. You remember Cyrus the Great, the Shahanshah, the King of Kings. Now they had what is known as Ghulams, which is very similar to the idea of a Janissary."
Social Studies,"These are slave soldiers which are taken as captives but then are raised to be an elite military unit and eventually often have significant wealth and significant power. Now you might be wondering, why did any of these empires and these aren't the only ones, you have the Mamluks and other Muslim empires. Why would people create these elite soldiers out of slaves and give them that much power? Well, the answer is, they were the safest people to give power to."
Social Studies,"Remember, these empires are ruling over many tribes and many groups and many kingdoms that are constantly vying for power, trying to establish their own dynasties. And if you allowed people from those various tribes to protect you as Emperor, well, there might be a good shot that one of them might want to kill you and establish their own dynasty. But from a young age, if you could indoctrinate these young boys as Ghulams, or as Janissaries, well, they might be more loyal to you."
Social Studies,"And indeed, it did provide an unusual amount of stability. As I mentioned, the Mughal Empire was able to be founded by Babur, who was Timur's great-grandson's grandson and he, too, was born in a Turco-Mongolian tradition. As he's able to famously defeat the Delhi Sultanate which had already been significantly weakened, one, on its own, but then by Timur over 100 years before, he famously comes to power with the aid of gunpowder, being able to defeat a significantly larger Delhi Sultanate army."
Social Studies,"The Mughals practiced Sunni Islam but they ruled over a large Hindu majority, and so the first several Mughal rulers were actually quite tolerant. Perhaps the most tolerant was Akbar, often known as Akbar the Great, who we'll do other videos on, who actually tried to create a religion which was a merger between Islam and Hinduism and Jainism and Christianity. But then they become less tolerant under Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb."
Social Studies,"Shah Jahan famous for building the Taj Mahal for his wife, but what's often not noted is he was building this fairly grand mausoleum at a time when there was a famine in India and he was also known as being fairly intolerant and persecuted many Hindus and Sikhs and his son, Aurangzeb, continued to do so. Now, some historians will refer to these three empires as the Gunpowder Empires. If someone says Gunpowder Empires, they're referring to these three."
Social Studies,"The reason why they're called that is this view that these major centralized empires were able to form only with the power of gunpowder. The Ottomans, famous for early use of artillery. The Mughals, Babur in particular, came to power with gunpowder. But today, historians are somewhat skeptical of grouping just these three empires as Gunpowder Empires. You had many other large centralized empires form before the use of gunpowder. So that whole thesis is not as popular today.."
Social Studies,"It all starts in the 15th century with the birth of who will eventually be known as Guru Nanak. He's born into a merchant class Hindu family, and he is known to be precocious from a very young age, especially when it comes to matters of spirituality. He is constantly questioning. He goes and learns about various religions. Remember, North India is under the control of the Muslims, but it's a Hindu-majority population, and you also have populations of Christians and Jains."
Social Studies,"And this is also a time, as we've studied in other videos, where the Bhakti movement is on the rise, this notion of devotional love to God within Hinduism, and it's in this context that Guru Nanak becomes a significant, some would say, Bhakti guru. To get a sense of some of his teachings: ""There is but one God. ""His name is Truth. ""He is without hate. ""He is beyond the cycle of births and deaths."
Social Studies,"""He is Self illuminated."" So just in this excerpt of some of his sayings, you see elements of the core of Hinduism and elements of Islam. There is but one God, a central tenet of Islam. But then, these ideas that really come from a Vedic tradition. God is beyond the cycle of births and deaths, samsara. He is self illuminated. There's a lot of mention of your inner self, your true self, is one with this God."
Social Studies,"""Even kings and emperors ""with heaps of wealth and vast dominion ""cannot compare with an ant filled with the love of God."" So here, you see this Bhakti influence, and you can see why he's considered a major Bhakti guru or Bhakti saint. He's emphasizing this devotional love of God. ""The world is a drama staged in a dream."" So here, you have the Hindu, the Vedic notions of Maya. The world is an illusion."
Social Studies,"His followers will eventually be known as Sikhs, and the word Sikh comes from the Sanskrit word for to learn or learning, and it's related to the word for student. And even in modern Sanskrit-derived languages like Hindi, you have words like sikhna, which means to learn. Guru Nanak dies in the early 16th century. You can see by this point, the Mughals have taken control of northern India. And before his death, he names Guru Angad, who is not his son, as his successor."
Social Studies,"After Guru Angad, you have Guru Amar Das, and then you have Guru Ram Das, who establishes the city now sacred to Sikhs known as Amritsar, originally known as Ramdaspur. Guru Dam Das is succeeded on his death by Guru Arjan. And Guru Arjan is significant for many reasons. He creates the compilation known as the Adi Granth, which are the sayings and the hymns of the previous gurus, including his own."
Social Studies,"The Adi Granth, as we will see, will eventually evolve into the Guru Granth Sahib, which is considered not only the Sikh holy book but also the last and final of the gurus. In Ramdaspur, later to be known as Amritsar, Guru Arjan builds the Harmandir Sahib, which is intended to be a place of worship for people of all religions."
Social Studies,"They have a tradition of langar, where they feed anyone who comes from any faith, and today the Harmandir Sahib would later be known as the Golden Temple where later Raja would plate it with gold, is the largest free kitchen in the world. Guru Arjan is also known as the first martyr in the Sikh faith. As we've told about, the early Mughals were relatively tolerant. Akbar in particular was extremely tolerant."
Social Studies,"But upon his death, his son Jahangir takes power, and early in Jahangir's reign, he is insecure about his hold on power. And remember, the Mughals are ruling from the same region where the Sikhs are having an increasingly growing following, not just from Hindus but also from Muslims. Threatened by this growing following, Jahangir imprisons Guru Arjan and tortures Guru Arjan trying to get him to renounce the faith to convert to Islam."
Social Studies,"Guru Arjan refuses despite many days of excruciating torture being boiled alive. Eventually, he dies and there's slightly varying accounts of how it happens. After his death, his son, who will be known as Guru Hargobind comes to power, and Guru Hargobind, as legend has it on direction from his father before he would die, tells him that the Sikhs need to protect themselves. They need to adopt a military tradition to protect themselves from the oppression especially the oppression from the Mughals."
Social Studies,"So, Guru Hargobind, he is famous for establishing the military tradition of Sikhism. He is the first guru to be what you could call a warrior saint. He's famous for wearing two swords. One to represent his authority in the spiritual realm and another to represent his authority in the temporal realm. He also has the longest tenure as guru. At Guru Hargobind's death, his grandson, Guru Har Rai becomes guru. At his death, his very young son, Guru Har Krishan becomes guru but dies of smallpox."
Social Studies,"Afterwhich, Guru Hargobind's youngest son becomes guru. He is named eventually Guru Tegh Bahadur which means brave sword or brave wielder of the sword because as his father, Guru Hargobind, fought the Mughals, he was known as being unusually brave and an unusually competent warrior."
Social Studies,"He continued this tradition of being a warrior saint and especially under the rule of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb as the Mughals became more and more intolerant and started force conversions, he viewed himself as a protector of the oppressed, not just of the Sikhs but the oppressed of any faiths including Hindus who are being forced to convert by Aurangzeb. Eventually, Aurangzeb tortures and kills him for refusing to convert to Islam and he is considered the second guru who is martyred."
Social Studies,"At his death, we have the tenth and last human guru of the Sikh tradition, Guru Gobind Singh, who continues, again, this tradition of a warrior saint and actually formalizes it in this notion of Khalsa. There's a famous story of him gathering the Sikh community and asking for volunteers. And the first volunteer he takes into a tent and then he emerges from that tent without the volunteer with a bloody sword giving people the impression that he might have killed that individual."
Social Studies,"Then, he asked for more volunteers and more people coming. Every time, he comes out of the tent without the volunteers but with a bloody sword. But after five volunteers have come, they all emerged from the tent. He makes it clear that this was an exercise as a test of faith to see who was willing to risk their life to follow the cause. And he says, ""These are the Khalsa, ""these are these are the pure."
Social Studies,"""Together, we are going to be a group to fight oppression ""wherever it might be."" And he formalizes what it means to be one of these warrior saints."
Social Studies,"Famously, with the Five K's of Khalsa that anyone who goes into the Khalsa indoctrination who becomes a Khalsa sikh, they should not cut their hair, this is known as Kesh, they should wear a metal bracelet known as Kara, they should have a wooden comb known as Kanga, and they should carry a short dagger or sword known a Kirpan and there is Kaccherra which is often an undergarment worn and has a symbolic meaning."
Social Studies,"A man who goes through the Khalsa ceremony, the Khalsa baptism, adopts the title of Singh which means lion, and a woman who does adopts the title, Kaur or princess, and it's essentially, they are promising to fight oppression wherever it might be. Guru Gobind Singh is also famous for the final compilation of what would be known as the Guru Granth Sahib."
Social Studies,"Taking the Adi Granth which was compiled by Guru Arjan and adding the 115 hymns of Guru Tegh Bahadur who was martyred, and making this collection of hymns not just from the gurus but from saints and gurus in the Hindu and Muslim tradition as well and declaring that this is the 11th and final guru and sikhs today view the Guru Granth Sahib as their guru."
Social Studies,"If you were to visit a gurdwara which is their temple, it means door to the gurus, dwara, same root in Sanskrit as door, you will see it houses a Guru Granth Sahib which the Sikhs will venerate and view as their guru.."
Social Studies,"we just want to lay the groundwork. What was it like to live in Europe before the Protestant Reformation? DR. BETH HARRIS: That is, before 1517, when Martin Luther, a German monk and professor of theology, nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the castle church in Wittenberg. And we'll get back to that. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: I was driving around my neighborhood about a week ago, and I took photographs of some of the churches that were there."
Social Studies,"And within only 15 or 20 minutes, I had photographed the signs in front of six different kinds of churches. DR. BETH HARRIS: And this is a really good place to start, because it's at the time of the Reformation that we get this explosion of different kinds of Christianity. So tell us what you took pictures of. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: I took pictures of a Lutheran church, of a Baptist church, of a United Methodist church, there was a Catholic church there, there was a Congregationalist church, there was a Presbyterian church. And so five of those six churches were created as a result of the Protestant Reformation. So let's go back to a time when there was only one kind of Christianity in Western Europe. DR. BETH HARRIS: And that's the religion, we today call, Roman Catholicism. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: Now we didn't need to use that phrase, Roman Catholicism, because there was nothing to differentiate it from. The term Catholic really means universal. And so that makes the point that this was the universal Church. DR. BETH HARRIS: Or that was their ambition, to be the Universalist Church. And we use the term Roman Catholic, because the head of the Church is in Rome. And that's the pope. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: And that man was enormously important, because he would lead the way to salvation, to Heaven, according to the Catholic tradition. That is, one found one's way to salvation, which was tremendously important, because the alternative was hell. DR. BETH HARRIS: And it's important to remember, I think, that back then, the concern for most people was salvation-- was how to get to Heaven. And the path was one path. It was through the teachings of the church, through the sacraments."
Social Studies,"In a way, it was a simpler time to live, because you had one choice. You didn't have to say, what religion should I be? DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Except for those very few people in Europe, for instance, very few Jews and even fewer Muslims. So the church really infused everybody's life-- it was the vehicle to salvation."
Social Studies,"And just for the average person in a small town, the church's spire would tower over the other buildings, the bells in the tower would ring on the hour, the church would celebrate the saint's feast days-- what we call holidays, that is, holy days-- and it was, in a sense, the church that marked the days of your life, and the major events in your life, as well. DR. BETH HARRIS: And through the sacraments, you hoped to earn God's grace, you hoped to secure yourself a place in Heaven."
Social Studies,"And the sacraments included baptism, confirmation, communion-- which you might know as the Eucharist-- penance-- also known as confession-- marriage, last rites, and ordination for priests. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And so it's just a good reminder of how important the Church was in the lives of everyday people. And those everyday people, although they might look to their local priests, would look to the pope in Rome as the ultimate authority on earth. And the pope, at this point in 1517, was Pope Leo X. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: So Pope Leo X was intent on rebuilding the Church of Saint Peter's, and the plans for Saint Peter's were very ambitious. In fact, Pope Julius II, who commissioned the rebuilding of Saint Peter's-- the pope before Leo X-- said he wanted to create the most grandiose church in all of Christendom. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And they did. The church itself, Saint Peter's Basilica, was tremendously important to the authority of the pope. By tradition, Saint Peter is buried under that church."
Social Studies,"And Saint Peter was charged by Christ himself to lead to church, and so Saint Peter is understood to be the first pope. And so every succeeding pope is taking on the job of Saint Peter from Christ himself. And so the very authority of this office is vested in this building. The problem is, the building was really expensive to construct. And the question was, where were they going to get the money? DR. BETH HARRIS: Well, there was a pretty common way to get money, and that was selling indulgences."
Social Studies,"Now an indulgence was a piece of paper that made it possible for you to get to Heaven more quickly. Most people when they died-- you had, throughout your life, confessed your sins, you had atoned for your sins, but there would probably be something that you hadn't quite atoned for. And so for most people, you wouldn't go straight to Heaven. You would go, instead, to this place in between-- a kind of way station before you got to Heaven. A place called Purgatory."
Social Studies,"And it was indulgences that bought you time off from Purgatory. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So this is a little tricky, because indulgences were actually a very old tradition. Where if you did a good work, you could, in fact, receive an indulgence. That is, a kind of certificate that would speed your soul out of Purgatory, to Heaven. Even in certain extraordinary cases, it might allow you to circumvent Purgatory entirely, and go directly to Heaven."
Social Studies,"The problems began not so much in the actual indulgences, but in the perception of the selling of indulgences. And here's what happened, Leo X granted indulgences to his representatives to raise money for the building of Saint Peter's, but this was misunderstood to mean that one could simply pay money and then gain access to Heaven directly. DR. BETH HARRIS: But keep in mind, that money was for the rebuilding of Saint Peter's."
Social Studies,"And say you were doing a good work, and according to the Catholic church, doing a good work is one of the ways you can assist in the process of gaining yourself a place in Heaven. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And it does make sense that even a monetary donation to doing good Christian work would be itself a kind of holy act. DR. BETH HARRIS: But it did come to be seen as a money exchange for getting to Heaven."
Social Studies,"And the one example that really got under Martin Luther's craw, so to speak, was a man named Tetzel, who was selling indulgences not far from Wittenburg where Luther was professor of theology. Tetzel said, ""as soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs."" So you can see right there, money is going in and a soul is going up to Heaven. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: It sounds so crass, and you're absolutely right."
Social Studies,"Martin Luther, who was a monk and was a very devout professor of theology, was really rubbed the wrong way by people saying that they had bought these indulgences and therefore, they were freed of their sins. DR. BETH HARRIS: And as a monk, Luther felt oppressed by the sinfulness of human nature, or his own nature, and so the idea that you could pay money to erase those sins and get quicker entry to Heaven was really an issue for him. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: He took these issues very seriously and really struggled with them. And then he did what any good doctor of theology would do, he wrote out a series of arguments. But in his case, he posted them, at least according to tradition, to the doors of the castle church in Wittenberg. 95 Theses, 95 arguments, that took issue primarily with the selling of indulgences. DR. BETH HARRIS: Luther sent them to the local archbishop, and they made their way to Rome."
Social Studies,"And so we have the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: In fact, if you think about those words, Protestant Reformation, for just a moment, I think it's interesting to note that the word Protestant is formed out of the work protest, and reformation out of the work reform. So this was a kind of protest against the church, and it was an attempt to reform it. [MUSIC PLAYING]."
Social Studies,"against the sale of indulgences, and that kind of monetary transaction for getting into Heaven. Tetzel, who was selling indulgences, we quoted in the first video, but here's another quote, ""Won't you part with even a farthing to buy this letter? It won't bring you money but rather a divine and immortal soul, whole and secure in the kingdom of heaven."" DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: We have to understand that this exists within this larger scheme, and the church thought that the ultimate aim was a good one."
Social Studies,But he sounds like a used car salesman. DR.
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: So Luther in one section of the 95 Theses, says you know people are going to ask questions that we can't really answer about what we're doing with these indulgences, such as, ""Why does not the Pope empty Purgatory for the sake of holy love and the dire need of the souls that are there, if he redeems an infinite number of souls for the sake of miserable money with which to buy a church? The former reason would be most just, the latter is most trivial."" See, what he's saying is, if the pope has the authority, the treasury of merit of all of the saints that he can distribute, why is he selling them to build the church? Why doesn't he just redeem the souls that are in Purgatory and send them up to Heaven, if he has the power to do that? And there was a perception that the church, at times, was a rather corrupt institution, that seemed to be more concerned with power, and political issues, and worldly issues, and not so concerned with the salvation of souls."
Social Studies,"DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Well the previous pope, Julius II, certainly had that kind of reputation. DR. BETH HARRIS: Right. This is a hard thing for us to realize, I think, but at this time, the popes claimed not only spiritual power, like they do today, but also political power, and governed these very significant lands, known as the Papal States. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And so, in some ways, the pope functioned as the princes of territories in Italy. DR. BETH HARRIS: Right."
Social Studies,"Pope Julius II led armies into battles against other Christians to reclaim territories that were historically part of the Papal States. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So this notion of a, kind of, corruption in Rome is infusing this entire discussion, this entire argument. DR. BETH HARRIS: So there had been other reformers before Luther who were not successful. For example, we could look to John Wyclif in the 14th century. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: So in the 1300s, this Englishman had set about to translate the Bible into the vernacular, into the common language, into English. DR. BETH HARRIS: He organized the translation of the Bible into English. He translated much of it himself. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Especially, much of the New Testament. DR. BETH HARRIS: It was important to him that the Bible be available to people in their common language-- that people could read it. If it's in Latin, essentially, only the priests could read it."
Social Studies,"This is important for us, because this idea of enabling the reading of the Bible was critical for Luther. And we'll get to that. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: OK. So let's just step back for a moment, and just remember that in Western Europe at this time, the vast majority of the population was illiterate. But those that could read, would be reading in the vernacular, not Latin. And by vernacular, I mean their common languages, whether it was English, or German, or French, or Italian, it wasn't Latin."
Social Studies,"And this was a means that the church could control the word of God. DR. BETH HARRIS: Well it meant that you heard the word of God through the priests-- you weren't able to read it yourself. Wyclif also attacked the abuses of the church, the worldliness of the church. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: After he died, he was declared a heretic. His body was exhumed, it was burned. His books were burned. He was punished after the fact. DR. BETH HARRIS: Another early reformer was John Hus. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: Now he was from Bohemia, and he was ultimately burned at the stake. DR. BETH HARRIS: In 1415. So this is just a little bit more than 100 years before Luther. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Now those 95 Theses were posted in Latin, but people translated it, without his authorization, into German, and then used the new technology of the printing press, and distributed it widely. DR. BETH HARRIS: The printing press had been invented in the mid-15th century."
Social Studies,"Incredibly important invention for the spread of Protestant ideas. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Well, think about what's happening here. Instead of the distribution network of the church, you have people acting on their own, outside of that structure, in their own language. DR. BETH HARRIS: So Luther posts the 95 Theses in 1517, word gets to the pope, he's accused of heresy, but he's gaining support, widely. And in 1521, he's called to a large council. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: So this event, we call the Diet of Worms, and it was under the auspices of the Holy Roman Emperor. DR. BETH HARRIS: So this is an unfortunate name. [LAUGHTER] DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Yes, it is. DR. BETH HARRIS: The Diet of Worms. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Nobody's eating worms. DR. BETH HARRIS: But a diet is a gathering, a council, and Worms or ""vorms,"" is a city in Germany. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So the new Holy Roman Emperor, who's, by the way, only a teenager at this time, has summoned Luther."
Social Studies,"He's given him an authorization of safe passage, that is, he won't be arrested on his way. And he is to testify at this council. DR. BETH HARRIS: So Luther is asked if he authored the books. He's presented with his own books. Luther says, yes, I did. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And then he's asked, do you stand by the ideas in these books? DR. BETH HARRIS: And Luther says, give me a day to think about that. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And that request is granted."
Social Studies,"He comes back the next day, and by all accounts, gives an eloquent defense of the ideas in the books and does not renounce any of the ideas. DR. BETH HARRIS: It's pretty clear that the lines are drawn. And Luther leaves Worms. He's declared an unrepentant heretic, it's clear he's going to be arrested, possession of his writings is forbidden, and he leaves the city of Worms. Remember, he's been granted safe passage, so he's allowed to leave Worms. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Now here's the crucial moment."
Social Studies,"Will he end up like Hus that is burned at the stake? Arrested? Will that be the end of his efforts, or will something else happen? Well, something else does happen, and that's because of political issues. The new emperor of the Holy Roman Empire had gotten that job because of the vote of men in Germany-- princes, who are called Electors. And one of those Electors, the Elector of Saxony, secretly kidnaps Luther as he leaves the city of Worms, and hides him away in a castle."
Social Studies,"Where, by the way, Luther immediately gets down to work writing and translating the New Testament. And by the time Luther emerges and returns to public life, the Holy Roman Emperor is involved in other issues and doesn't pursue his arrest. So Luther is able to do something that Hus, that Wyclif was not able to do, which is to continue his campaign. DR. BETH HARRIS: In a way, the whole Reformation happens because of issues like this."
Social Studies,"That local rulers, whether they're monarchs or princes, are tired of seeding so much authority and political power to the pope, and use the opportunity of the Reformation to wrest back some control of their own lands, of their own people. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: If you think about the power structure in Europe at this time, especially in what will become Germany, you have the local princes, you have the authority of the pope in Rome on the other side of the Alps, but you also have the Holy Roman Emperor."
Social Studies,"So it was very complicated, and everybody was trying to enlarge their own stake. So Martin Luther is at the Diet of Worms, he's been confronted with his own writings, he's in a really dangerous situation. DR. BETH HARRIS: Luther was going against one of the central doctrines of the church. And that was that you were justified. That is, that you got to Heaven in two ways, according to the church. One, through God's forgiveness, through God's grace."
Social Studies,"The other, through things that you could do yourself, choices that you could make as a human being through what the church called good works. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So by good works we mean, for instance, helping to build Saint Peter's Basilica. DR. BETH HARRIS: Exactly. Or donating money to the church. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Or helping the poor, or any of the things that we think, in the modern world, of charitable work. DR. BETH HARRIS: Exactly."
Social Studies,"And Luther was deeply disturbed by this idea, because in his own conscience he felt so sinful that nothing he felt that he could do could help him get to Heaven. There was not enough good works to do in the world to remove the sin that he felt that he lived with, and that all human beings lived with."
Social Studies,"If you think about the medieval mind tallying up the sins they've committed, and sometimes sins can just be like jealousy or envy, and tallying those against the good works that they've done, you can imagine this constant tallying that must have gone on in the medieval conscience. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So this is a terrible responsibility on the individual. And so it must have been a tremendous relief when he read carefully the words of Saint Paul. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: Luther read Saint Paul, who said, ""For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, 'The just shall live by faith.'"" Those last words were critical for Luther. That meant to Luther that one is justified, one gets to Heaven, through faith alone, not through good works."
Social Studies,"Salvation with something freely granted by God, and not something that had to be earned by human beings. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So faith was a kind of gift that God gave you, and that faith was all you needed to get to Heaven. DR. BETH HARRIS: Through faith alone, is one of Luther's central ideas. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So all of this make sense in relationship to the 95 Theses, and to Luther's concern about indulgences, because the indulgence is this proposition that good works will hurry the soul to Heaven."
Social Studies,"And that's precisely what Luther is taking issue with. DR. BETH HARRIS: And with, really, the whole authority of the church to forgive, to remit sin and to allow a person into Heaven. Luther's feeling was that the only power to do that was with God. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So he looks at his books, and he does not renounce them. DR. BETH HARRIS: No. And he eventually returns to Wittenburg and founds the Lutheran church, and sparks many other types of Protestantism that we'll talk about in the next video."
Social Studies,[MUSIC PLAYING].
Social Studies,"which he completes in a matter of months. And it's important to Luther because it means that everyone can read the Bible for themselves. Luther's main ideas are scripture alone, and the priesthood of all believers. So you don't need to go to the church to understand the word of God, to understand the path to salvation, all you need to do is to read the Bible-- scripture alone, so putting the Bible in the hands of everyone."
Social Studies,"This other idea of the priesthood of all believers, is this notion that we can have a direct relationship with God that's unmediated by the priests, by a local bishop, or by the pope. It's just us and our creator. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So we've come across three major ideas then from Luther, faith alone, scripture alone, and the priesthood of all believers."
Social Studies,"Now these ideas, that we can look directly at the scriptures, that we can have that kind of direct relationship with God, means that lots of people can come up with slightly varying understandings of what that relationship is. DR. BETH HARRIS: Right."
Social Studies,"As soon as the word of God is not mediated by the church, as soon as everyone can read it for themselves, it becomes clear just how ambiguous much of what's in the New Testament and the Old Testament really is, and how differently it can be interpreted by different people. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And that's why we have so many different Protestant sects. DR. BETH HARRIS: Immediately, Luther's words spread very quickly. If we go to Zurich, to Switzerland, we find Zwingli."
Social Studies,"Like Luther, he looks to scripture as the sole authority, not the church, but scripture. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Now he differed from Luther in one important regard, the Eucharist. Now Luther had already broken with the Catholic Church's understanding of the Eucharist, that there was transubstantiation-- that is, that the bread and the wine was by miracle transformed into the actual flesh and the actual blood of Christ."
Social Studies,"Luther believed that the blood of Christ and the flesh of Christ was present in the bread and the wine, but not that the priest had this, kind of, special power that allowed for the transformation itself. And then Zwingli changes that interpretation, and says that the Eucharist is entirely symbolic, and that there is no actual blood and no actual flesh present in the church. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: Right, and actually, Luther and Zwingli got together to debate this issue, to try to create a more unified Protestant Church, but they were unable to agree. So you can see these very serious doctrinal disputes that are going on during this time. Everything is being questioned. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Well, in Zurich, at the same time also, we have another group, the Anabaptists. And they're fascinating, because they take issue with the practice of baptism close to birth."
Social Studies,"That is, an infant is brought and baptized. They look back to the belief that Christ was baptized as an adult. That is, he was baptized of his own free will. And they were called the Anabaptists by people who didn't like them, because they saw this kind of spiritual awakening later in life when we could take responsibility for our spiritual lives. DR. BETH HARRIS: Right. And Anabaptist actually means re-baptism, which was completely against Catholic Church doctrine. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: And the Amish and the Mennonites, actually, come directly from the Anabaptists. DR. BETH HARRIS: And those may be more familiar to us. John Calvin, another really important reformer during this period, who we might know for his doctrine of predestination. This is really following very much what Luther also taught, that all you needed to have was faith. God had already decided, for Calvin, from the beginning of time who was elect."
Social Studies,"In other words, who was blessed, who would go to Heaven, and who would go to Hell. In other words, completely disregarding the possibility of free will, of choice. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: It's interesting, because we generally think that we have some agency-- that we can make our way into Heaven if only we are really, truly good. But Calvin and Luther are both saying, no, this is entirely God's will, and we only enact it. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: God exists in an eternal realm, and so it's not like God woke up on Monday and said, you're damned, and you, over there, you're going to Hell. But something that's predetermined. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Now, Calvin was French. He was a lawyer, originally, but he fled to Switzerland. But let's go to England. What's happening there? DR. BETH HARRIS: Well, Henry VIII wants an annulment from his first wife Catherine of Aragon, because she's failed to produce any male heirs to the throne. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: Well, she had produced, or I should say, they had produced male heirs. They just haven't survived infancy. DR. BETH HARRIS: And so Henry VIII applies to the pope for an annulment, and the pope is actually worried about offending the Holy Roman Emperor, and there's all sorts of political issues, but he says, sorry, I can't grant you an annulment. So Henry then goes to the head of the Church in England, and says, will you grant me an annulment? And that is granted."
Social Studies,"And so the power of the pope is usurped in this case, and soon after that, an act of parliament makes the king, the monarch of England, the head of the Church in England. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: But I think we need to be careful. Because we don't want to say that the Anglican Church, that is, the Church of England that Henry is now heading, is entirely the result of his desire for a divorce, or an annulment. There are strong spiritual and also political issues here."
Social Studies,"Just like in the Germanic countries, many felt that the pope had too much power. And Henry was not only getting his annulment, he was also getting the lands of the church. DR. BETH HARRIS: Protestantism is spreading in primarily German-speaking countries, up in Scandinavia, and England, and Scotland, in Switzerland, but if we look to southern Germany and Italy, or France, or Spain, those countries remain predominantly Catholic. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: All true, but focusing too much on the politics and focusing too much on Henry's marriages-- because ultimately, Henry VIII will have six marriages-- is to miss the brutality, the violence of this period. DR. BETH HARRIS: On both sides, Catholics and Protestants. Thousands of people were hanged, burned at the stake, tortured, simply because of their beliefs."
Social Studies,"And each side was convinced that they were in the right, and the other side was not only in the wrong, but actually, somehow in the power of the devil. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: This was one of the most violent periods in Europe, and some of the worst violence took place in France. Now the French Protestants were known as Huguenots. And initially, there was some tolerance, but that ended fairly quickly. And the Huguenots were declared, en masse, heretical. That is, Protestantism was outlawed in France. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: And it was a civil war in France for much of the end of the 16th century. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: But just like in the German countries and just like in England, the issues were not only spiritual, they were also political. And so what you had is an alignment of the ruling families of France pitted against each other on both the Protestant and the Catholic sides. DR. BETH HARRIS: We also see attempts at tolerance."
Social Studies,"So for example, in the German states, the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 establishes this principle of, ""Whose realm, his religion."" This idea that the local princes in the Holy Roman Empire could choose the religion for their area. In other words, they could choose between Protestantism and Catholicism. It's not going to be declared by the Holy Roman Emperor. The ruler of each region is going to get to decide."
Social Studies,"And similarly, in France, we have the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which establishes the principle of religious toleration. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So that really ends this long period in the second half of the 16th century known as the French Wars of Religion. And finally, there is some peace. But ultimately, things just got worse. By the early 17th century, we see the beginning of the 30 Years' War, which pitted Protestants and Catholics against each other, especially in the Holy Roman Empire. [MUSIC PLAYING]."
Social Studies,"We looked at his ideas, and the spread of his ideas. As well as the violence that resulted. DR. BETH HARRIS: And for our final video, we want to look at the response by the Catholic Church. And so, whereas we call what Luther and his followers did the Protestant Reformation, the Church's response is referred to as the Counter-Reformation. The word ""counter,"" here, meaning against. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Well the Church had lost a lot. The church had lost lands. It had lost-- DR. BETH HARRIS: Faithful. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: That's right. It lost souls. DR. BETH HARRIS: And in the last video, we ended talking about violence. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: But the violence wasn't always against people. Sometimes it was also against things, and churches. That is, the architecture of the Roman Catholics, which existed throughout Western Europe, was an important focus of the violence of the Protestants against the Catholic church. DR. BETH HARRIS: The practice of Catholicism was incredibly visual."
Social Studies,"And there was a real concern among the Protestants, not so much by Luther, but mostly by his followers, that images were being abused. That they were being prayed to as if the images had power themselves, instead of just a way of reaching the divine-- of passing through the images to the divine. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: That's right. Calvin, specifically, had a problem with this, and believed that the images in churches were actually creating a kind of idolatry."
Social Studies,"This goes back to the second commandment, ""Thou shall not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in the heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth."" So this notion that to create is, in a sense, usurping a little bit of God's responsibility. That is, God creates. When an artist creates it is a kind of falsehood-- it is creating an idol. DR. BETH HARRIS: So Protestants began waves iconoclasm. That is, the destruction of images. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: Let's take apart that work for a moment, iconoclasm. It's a compound. It's made of two words, ""icon,"" which is Greek for image, and ""clasm,"" which means of violence. So it is literally violence against images. DR. BETH HARRIS: And there were iconoclastic riots within five years or so after Luther's 95 Theses. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: This is one of the great tragedies in the history of art, actually, where an untold number of paintings, of sculptures, were destroyed. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: And this happened, especially, in northern Europe, in the Netherlands. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So in essence, what the Protestants often did is they took over a Catholic church, and they stripped it of all of those central forms, all of that sculpture, those tapestries, and left it a kind of pristine space. DR. BETH HARRIS: So we know that Luther is going against Church teaching in all these different ways. Faith is the path to salvation, not good works."
Social Studies,"Scripture is the way to understand God, not listening to the teachings of the church. Now, the Catholic church didn't take all of this lying down, right? We know that there were efforts to make Luther bend to their will, right? At the Diet of Worms, for example. Luther was excommunicated after that. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And by excommunicated, we mean, basically, is no longer a member of the Church. DR. BETH HARRIS: In 1545. the Church holds something called the Council of Trent."
Social Studies,"Essentially, a kind of meeting of all of the highest levels of the Church in Europe. At first, the idea was really to reconcile with the Protestants. The Protestants were invited. They didn't show up, however, and in the end, reconciliation was clearly impossible. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: One of the most important outcomes of the Council of Trent, was that the Catholic Church reaffirmed its doctrines. That is, it doubled down. It said the very things that Luther had taken issue with were reaffirmed. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: So regarding the issue of whether good works have a role in salvation, the Church said, indeed they do. Regarding Purgatory and the efficacy of indulgences-- do indulgences do anything? Does purgatory exist? The Church affirmed all of that. The Church affirmed transubstantiation, the changing of the bread and wine during the Eucharist to the body and blood of Christ. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And by doing so, it affirmed the power and importance of the priesthood, and of the hierarchy of the church."
Social Studies,"DR. BETH HARRIS: And lastly, the Church affirmed that scripture alone wasn't enough. That one really also needed the teachings, the traditions of the Church. So they gave very little ground. All they did was agree that in some areas there was room for reform. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: They did try to stamp out the kind of corruption that had, in part, led to the Reformation. But let's get back to the images for a moment. Because that was also important in the Council of Trent. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: The council said this-- ""Images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God, and of the other saints are to be placed and retained especially in the churches, and due honor and veneration is to be given to them."" So they're reaffirming, immediately, images belong in the church. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: But what's important is why. DR. BETH HARRIS: They say, quote, ""Because the honor which is shown them is referred to the prototypes which they represent."" DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: So if somebody is honoring a statue of the Virgin Mary, they are actually affirming the honor to the Virgin Mary herself. But the Church said there was even more benefit. DR. BETH HARRIS: Yes. ""Let the bishops diligently teach that by means of the stories of the mysteries of our redemption portrayed in paintings and other representations the people are instructed and confirmed in their articles of faith."" DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: So art was a way of actually didactically getting the ideas of the Church across to the lay people, many of whom were still illiterate. DR. BETH HARRIS: And deepening their faith, that's right."
Social Studies,"""Also that great profit is derived from all holy images because through the saints the miracles of God and salutary examples are set before the eyes of the faithful so that they may fashion their own life and conduct in imitation of the saints and be moved to adore and love God and cultivate piety."" DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So the way in which art functions as an example that we can follow in our daily lives. DR. BETH HARRIS: So the Church's response is threefold."
Social Studies,"One, they reaffirm all the basic doctrines of the church that had been attacked by the Protestants. They begin a major campaign to spread the teachings of the Catholic faith all around the world. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Remember, this is the Age of Discovery. The New World has been discovered. There is increasing trade with Asia, and with Africa. And so, the Catholics are really evangelizing in all these places. DR. BETH HARRIS: The last in this threefold response of the Church is an effort to stamp out heresy."
Social Studies,"So the Church establishes the Inquisition, the Roman Inquisition. The Church also creates the Index of Forbidden Books. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And it's just at this time, that Ignatius Loyola founds the Jesuit Order. The Jesuits are all about faithfulness. They have an absolute faith in the pope, and they are at the pope's disposal. DR. BETH HARRIS: The Jesuits establish schools, they spread the Christian faith throughout the world, and they fought Protestantism. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: There's a fabulous, and very literal, example of all of these ideas of the Counter-Reformation in a sculpture by an artist whose name is Le Gros, in the mother church of the Jesuits in Rome. DR. BETH HARRIS: The title of this sculpture is Religion Overthrowing Heresy and Hatred. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: OK. Now, first of all, it's important to know that the sculpture is just to the right and below a very large alter to Saint Ignatius Loyola. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: At the top left, we see the figure of religion wielding a thunderbolt and a cross. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Now, by religion Le Gros means Roman Catholicism. DR. BETH HARRIS: And religion is looking down at, and about to attack, two figures. One is an older female figure who represents hatred, and the other figure, falling towards us, wrestling with sneaks, is the allegorical figure that represents heresy. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: He's falling over a series of books."
Social Studies,"And one of those books has on its spine Luther's name. So heresy here couldn't be any more explicit. Heresy is Luther. It is Protestantism. And as if that isn't making the point sharply enough, on the left, we see a little angelic figure who's ripping pages out of the book by Luther's follower Zwingli. DR. BETH HARRIS: It's important to remember that each side saw the other as the devil. Luther called the pope the Antichrist. The pope called Luther the Antichrist. It was a time of black and white."
Social Studies,"There was no middle ground. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And these divisions, literally, reshaped the countries of Europe. Even now, the countries in southern Europe are predominantly Catholic. The countries in northern Europe are predominately Protestant. And even as late as the 20th century, there is violence that erupts between these fractions. We saw that through most of the 20th century in Ireland, for example. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: It's also interesting to think about the ways that the Protestant Reformation set the stage for the modern world. This idea of not listening to a single authority, but listening to your own conscience. I think this is a key feature of the modern world. [MUSIC PLAYING]."
Social Studies,"The early ninth century, we see the reign of Charlemagne that we talk about in some depth in other videos. As we get into the 10th century, you see the reign of Otto the Great, Holy Roman Emperor over the Germanic kingdoms. The ninth century is also the time of Tang China. You have the Abbasid Muslim Caliphate in control over most of the Middle East and North Africa. And it is also the Viking age."
Social Studies,"So we have here in this magenta color, this would be modern day Sweden, but it was also the home of the Varangians, or whom we later would refer to as the Vikings, and we know them to be great seafarers. In Western Europe, they're viewed as raiders of towns along the coast. But you have to remember, these histories are often written by the western Europeans, not by the Vikings themselves. But they were also known as traders."
Social Studies,"What you see here are two of the major centers of power and trade in the ninth century. You have Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, and you have Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. You also see these major waterways in eastern Europe, in particular, the Dnieper and the Volga Rivers."
Social Studies,"And so you have these significant trade routes going from the Baltic Sea either via the Dnieper, crossing the Black Sea to Constantinople, or going from the Baltic to the Volga all the way to the Caspian Sea and eventually making their way to Baghdad. And this is well documented. There is archeological evidence of Viking jewelry along these routes."
Social Studies,"There's evidence of artifacts from these far off lands in Viking territory, and we believe what the Varangians traded were first they hunted in this area of northern Europe. Now, the people who lived in this area were known as the Slavs. And there were several broad groups of Slavs that you will hear historians refer to. You have the Western Slavs, who you could view as some of the ancestors of modern Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks."
Social Studies,"You have the Southern Slavs in what would eventually be referred to as the Balkans. And then you have the Eastern Slavs in what will eventually be Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Now to be clear, they weren't unified groups. There were many many many, for example, Eastern Slavic tribes. Our best account of the early history, especially in the period as we get into the ninth century comes from what is known as the Russian Primary Chronicle. And keep in mind, this was written at a much later period."
Social Studies,"It was written in the early 12th century. It is sometimes ascribed to the Kievan monk Nestor. So at previous times, it was known as Nestor's Chronicles, but we don't even have surviving accounts of this. We have surviving accounts of copies of this, or what we believe are copies of this. What I'll share is a version of the Russian Primary Chronicle known as the Laurentian Text from 1377. And this is, of course, an English translation."
Social Studies,"It gives us some of the earliest accounts of the relationship between the Varangians and the Eastern Slavs and how what we have come to identify as the Russian people and the Ukrainian people and the Belorussian people, how they got their start. So right before this passage, it talks about how the Varangians tried to get tribute from some of the Eastern Slavic tribes."
Social Studies,"And it says the tributaries of the Varangians drove them back beyond the sea and, refusing them further tribute, set out to govern themselves. So they pushed them back beyond what we now call the Baltic Sea, and they decided to govern themselves. There was no law among them. Tribe rose against tribe, and they began to war one against another. They said to themselves, let us seek a prince who may rule over us and judge us according to the law. They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes."
Social Studies,"So they went back to the Russes, and they said, these warring Eastern Slavic tribes said, our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us. They thus selected three brothers. The oldest, Rurik, located himself in Novgorod. Right over here. Novgorod literally means new town. Gorod means town. The district of Novgorod became known as the land of Rus'. So a lot of really interesting things going on."
Social Studies,"The Varangians, first, are trying to get tribute from these tribes, which is a way of saying tax them, making them subservient to these Vikings. And even though these Eastern Slavs were able to push them back, according to the Primary Chronicle, they said hey we need your help. We want you to rule over us. There's very few times in history where people are asking a foreign group to rule over them. And so this is an interesting question."
Social Studies,"Remember, this history is written under the rule of one of the descendants of Rurik. So do you think it was actually this way? Or do you think the Varangians maybe forced themselves on the Eastern Slavs and later created this narrative, that they were invited to come in? But according to the Primary Chronicle, we have Rurik coming from Scandinavia to Novgorod and establishing the land of Rus'. Now the word Rus is really interesting."
Social Studies,"Most historians believe it to be the source of what we now say Russia, or even Belarus, which means white Rus. Some historians think it comes from the name of Sweden at the time. Some believe that the Rus were a subgroup of Varangians, of Vikings. Some believe that the word is derived from those who row."
Social Studies,"But either way, the Primary Chronicle goes on to tell us from 870 to 879, on his deathbed, Rurik bequeathed his realm to Oleg, who belonged to his kin, and entrusted to Oleg's hands his son Igor, for he was very young. And then from 880 to 882, Oleg set himself up as prince in Kiev and declared that it should be the mother of Russian cities. So Rurik's immediate successor is Oleg. And in the early 880s, he goes and establishes himself in Kiev, expanding the land of Rus'."
Social Studies,"This is Kiev right over here, and because Oleg was able to take Kiev, the state that emerges from Rurik and Oleg not only is it known as the Land of the Rus', but it's also known as the Kievan State, and they're often known as the Kievan Rus'. And you can see here how that state expands over the next few hundred years. As we get to the year 900, you have this off-white color, and you can see, it is in control of both Novgorod and Kiev."
Social Studies,"As you get to 1015, it's taken even more territory, and by 1113, which is near the peak of the Kievan state, you see that it has taken control of a good chunk of Eastern Europe. And as the state expands, its character changes as well. As you get to the end of the 10th century, you have a major event in one of Rurik's descendants, Vladimir, often known as Vladimir the Great, he decides to convert to Eastern Orthodox Christianity."
Social Studies,"And in a future video, I might talk about his rationales, or what historians view as his rationales for conversion. And as we will see, over time, and because of not only his conversion, but essentially the conversion of the entire Kievan state, over time, especially with the eventual decline of the Byzantine Empire, what would eventually be Russia becomes a center of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Now the Kievan state lasts as an independent state until we get to the 13th century."
Social Studies,"And from many other videos, you might be guessing what happens in the 13th century. You have Genghis Khan and then his descendants emerge out of Central and Eastern Asia, and in 1240, you have the Mongol invasion, at which point, many of the principalities within the Land of Rus' become tributaries to the Mongolians."
Social Studies,"And they would be so for the next, roughly, 200 years until Ivan the Great comes along and is able to exert independence from the Mongols for the Rus, but we will cover that in a future video.."
Social Studies,"So if you've been following along this far, you may have noticed two things. One, that the people who named this war seem to be very bad at math because 1754 to 1763 is nine years, not seven, and that this war seems to have two names, both the Seven Years' War and the French and Indian War, which is a name you perhaps have heard before. Well, lemme tackle those two oddities in reverse order. So not only does the Seven Years' War have two names, it has a whole number of names."
Social Studies,"It's called the Seven Years' War, the French and Indian War, the War of the Conquest, the Pomeranian War, the Third Silesian War, the Third Carnatic War. This is a war with a whole bunch of names, and the reason that it has a whole bunch of names is that it was fought in a whole bunch of places. The Seven Years' War was really the first global war, and we're talking 150 years before World War One."
Social Studies,"Aspects of the Seven Years' War, as you can kinda see from this map, were fought in Europe, in South America, the coast of Africa, in India, the Philippines, and of course, in North America. The many different names come from the many different fronts of this war, and I would say that French and Indian War is actually the name for the North American front of this war, or theater of this war. So there are two reasons why I think Seven Years' War is a better name than French and Indian War."
Social Studies,One is that Seven Years' War gets at the idea that it was not just happening in North America.
Social Studies,"It was happening all over the world, so it shows that it was a global war, but I also think Seven Years' War is a better name than French and Indian War because I think French and Indian War is kind of confusing because you would think that it means that the principal parties in this war were the English versus the French and the Indians, when in fact it was the English and their Indian allies versus the French and their Indian allies."
Social Studies,"Native Americans fought on both sides of this conflict, so rather than the English and Indian versus French and Indian War, let's go with the shorter Seven Years' War, which brings us back to our awkward date range. So the reason that it's called the Seven Years' War is because the English didn't actually declare war on the French until 1756. So even though fighting started a little bit earlier in North America, the true range of dates, at least in legal terms, is from 1756 to 1763, or seven years."
Social Studies,"It's a complicated name for a complicated war, but really what it came down to was England and France duking it out over who was going to be the supreme imperial power in the world, and they were concerned about who was going to have the most territory in the world, therefore, their concern over who was going to control North America and their competing claims here, and also access to trade."
Social Studies,"So who was going to be able to trade with North Americans? Who was going to be able to trade with the lucrative Indian subcontinent, and who would be the leading power in Europe? So let's dial in a little closer on the North American theater of this war, which will have the most effect on the future United States. Alright, so here is map of territorial claims by European powers in North America before the Seven Years' War."
Social Studies,"Now you can see that there are some places where they overlap, which is really gonna be the heart of the problem in this conflict. So England, shown here in red, I'm gonna outline it a bit, was, as you know from your early American history, here along the eastern seaboard of what's today the United States, and also up into Canada. France claimed this interior region of Canada and today of the territorial United States, and Spain was in the mix here."
Social Studies,"Remember Spain has still been a fairly influential colonial power in Florida and in contemporary Mexico, and also down here in Cuba and South America. Alright, so we've got three major European powers in the mix here in North America, England, France, and Spain, but what this map doesn't show is the American Indian powers, who are also in this area."
Social Studies,"So most of this region really west of the Appalachian mountains, is Indian country, and the majority of inhabitants were Native Americans, and they really held the majority of power in this region as well. So major Native American groups that are in play in this conflict are Iroquois Confederacy, and also Cherokees, Hurons, Algonquians, Abenakis, and Mi'kmaqs, and that's just a small sampling."
Social Studies,"So you can see that there are a number of important Native American tribes who are specifically in this area of Canada, which is disputed, and also moving in the greater Appalachian region. So what does each of these groups want? Well, England definitely wants territory. They want to make sure that they're English settlers along the eastern seaboard, whom we'll soon be calling Americans, have room to expand."
Social Studies,"The French wanna make sure that they still have access to trade with Native Americans because their main concern is fur, which is a very valuable commodity in Europe, and Spain wants to make sure that they have access to their sugar islands and also their precious metals in the Caribbean and in South America."
Social Studies,"Now it's worth noting, 'cause I think this is really interesting to students of American history, that all of this territory, all of North America, was way less valuable than all of this territory because we're not talking about just value in land. We're talking about value in commodities, and what the Caribbean had was sugar, and sugar is the most valuable crop in this time period."
Social Studies,"So a tiny island down here in the Bahamas is probably worth more to a European power than the entire interior of North America, and what do these Native American groups want? Well, some of them want help with revenge on each other. Many other smaller Native American groups have been displaced by the Iroquois, who are here in upstate New York, kind of Quebec region."
Social Studies,"So the Iroquois is actually expanding and really defending their claim as the largest Native American empire, but the other thing that they want is to make sure that their territory is no longer encroached upon by English settlers in particular. Now one mistake I see early students of U.S."
Social Studies,"history making is thinking that all Native Americans kind of shared a cultural and political bond, right? That they saw themselves as one larger people who had to unite against the encroachment of Europeans, and that was definitely not the case. Native Americans had been living in this territory for thousands of years, and they had enemies and beef with other groups that went back way longer than the arrival of Europeans in North America."
Social Studies,"So when nations like England and France arrived with their weapons and their trade goods, the American Indians didn't look at each other and say, ""Oh wait, now we're all one race. ""We need to join together against ""the encroachment of whites."" They saw England and France and Spain as possible avenues to getting one up on their older enemies. So when an English trader sold a gun to, say, a Huron, he was way more likely to go after, say, the Iroquois with that gun than he was to go after a French trader."
Social Studies,"So another reason why the Seven Years' War is a better name for the French and Indian War than French and Indian War is because these Native American groups did not ally all with France. In fact, the Iroquois and Cherokee ended up allied with England, and most of the other Native American groups ended up allied with France, but they were fighting each other in addition to fighting England."
Social Studies,"Alright, so the stage is set for this conflict with all of these competing groups in this unclear territory, and how this turns into a war, we'll get to in the next video.."
Social Studies,"Would it be England? Or would it be France? Now in the North American theater of this war, England, France, their Native American allies on both sides were vying for territory and particularly territory along the Appalachian mountain range in upstate New York, Canada. This kind of western territory that was the border between the English settlement and Indian country to the west."
Social Studies,"In this video, let's talk about how the war actually progressed and what it's consequences were for North America and later, the United States. All right, so we've got the English, the French, and a number of Native American tribes all kind of jostling for position in North America. Now what stresses the British out the most the presence of the French in the Ohio River Valley. Both, the British and the French have laid claim to this territory."
Social Studies,"And they're both eager to strengthen their territorial claims, by building forts, and otherwise having a show of possession of the area. They argue over who had a presence there first. So to establish the English presence in the Ohio River Valley the English send a young officer named George Washington to build a fort. George Washington is only 22 years old at the time."
Social Studies,"And he and his men go out this area and they run into some French with their Native American allies at Fort Duquesne which is where the Alaganee, Monhongahela, and Ohio rivers come together. Which is today, Pittsburgh. So George Washington and his allies get the jump on the French. But, that doesn't last very long. They're overpowered and they fall back and establish Fort Necessity. On account of it was necessary."
Social Studies,"And they managed to hold out for a little while but eventually the French, the Canadians, and their Native America allies forced Washington to surrender. And he goes back to Virginia. So that's 1754. And we'll call that Fail number one. All right, so then a year later 1755, the British try to displace the French from Fort Duquesne once again. And they send Major General Edward Braddock George Washington, once again, now he's 23. Back to Fort Duquesne and it's a complete disaster."
Social Studies,"This time, the French and their Indian allies get the drop on the English, and with a much smaller force, completely desinate the English troops. And Braddock is killed. And George Washington has to take command of the retreat. So that's Fail number two."
Social Studies,"In general, this war does not go terribly well for the British at the beginning, except in one area, Acadia, where the British manage to attain control and they kick out the French settlers, the Acadians, who are transported down to the French settlement of New Orleans. In Louisiana. Where eventually, their name becomes garbled and they're known as the Cajuns. Not the Acadians, but the Cajuns. In 1756 England finally gets around to actually declaring war on France."
Social Studies,"But it's really not for another year that the war starts to actually go well in 1757. And the reason that the war starts going well for the English, finally, is that the Prime Minister, William Pitt, decides that he is going to pour money into this endeavor. So he thinks that the English have just not had enough men, materials, money, Indian allies, up until this point. So he is really going to commit the British empire exiling the French from this area of North America."
Social Studies,"So between 1757 and 1760, things really start looking up for the British. They finally capture Fort Duquesne. And they capture the Ohio Valley. Nova Scotia. Upstate New York. And, Quebec. So, by 1760 pretty much all the fighting is done in North America. The English have more or less forced the French out of the eastern seaboard and Canada. And in 1763, the English and the French sit down to hammer out the Treaty of Paris."
Social Studies,"So the Treaty of Paris, in 1763, and I apologize, I cannot help the fact that there are like a million treaties of Paris. There's also the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War. There's the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish American War. Paris was the place where you made treaties and they're all called the Treaty of Paris. But this is the one that happened in 1763. In general, this was a big victory. For the English. The English not only got most of France's possessions in the New World."
Social Studies,"They got New France, AKA Canada. They got Spanish Florida. Spain was fighting on the side of France. So they lose that. They got a bunch of Sugar Islands. In the Caribbean. And they pretty much got recognized as the premiere power in Europe. And the premiere imperial power. So, the largest and most powerful empire in the world. And let's not forget that the colonial Americans citizens of Massachusetts, and New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, they were on the winning side here."
Social Studies,"They fought alongside the British regulars. They repelled the French and their Native American allies. This was actually a pretty big confidence boost young America. But there were some other consequences of this war. On the not so good side, the Seven Year's War was not particularly good for Native Americans, in general. Both those who had allied with the British. And those who had allied with the French."
Social Studies,"They no longer had two imperial powers vying against each other in North America that they could play off of each other. Now, Native Americans were only dealing with the British. Who certainly were not giving them a fair seat at the table. Not long after the Seven Year's War, they will institute what's called the Proclamation of 1763. Which was basically a boundary line along the Appalachian mountains saying that that was going to be the end of white settlement."
Social Studies,"That they would reserve all the lands west of the Appalachians for Native Americans. Well, you can imagine how much the American white settlers respected that. Which is to say, they completely ignored this boundary line. So, the Native Americans will continue to be pushed farther west. And to develop more of what we call a race consciousness. The idea that they were all in one big group together who had to combine forces to repel English settlement."
Social Studies,"The other major outcome of the Seven Year's War was taxation. Remember that William Pitt won the Seven Year's War by pouring money into it. At the end of the Seven Year's War England is in a lot of debt. And, they have just gone to a lot of trouble to protect their North American interests."
Social Studies,"Now, as they are looking for ways to make revenue to make up the deficit, the Seven Year's War has placed on them, they look at their North American colonists and say, ""You should pay your way."" the American colonists, who have been used to more than century of called salutary, or benign neglect, are shocked and outraged that the British empire is now clamping down on them. And the colonists reaction to those new taxes will propel the colonies into revolution.."
Social Studies,"The American colonies are going to become free and independent, a separate country, which means rebelling against the King himself, George the III. Male: And this is George the III in all of his regality. (laughing) Walter: Right."
Social Studies,"You know up until they met in Congress with the Continental Congress gathering themselves together they pretended at least to respect George the III, and they were blaming everything on the British Parliament, but it was a pretty difficult thing to decide you were going to overthrow the King himself. Male: And just to be clear, this Continental Congress it's easy now for us in hindsight. It seems like a very official thing, but this was really a rebel congress."
Social Studies,"It wasn't sanctioned in any way by kind of the formal government, by the government of Great Britain. Walter: Right, and as you see it says the 13 United States of America. This is the first time they really start using the phrase United States of America. They weren't really a country yet. They were 13 different colonies, and not all of them wanted to come to this Continental Congress. Getting them all together was quite difficult."
Social Studies,"They do so partly to help George Washington's troops get funded because they've started the skirmishes up in Lexington and Concord and Massachusetts, but by 1776 George Washington has a real army and they have to fund him, and eventually they'd figure out well this congress ought to decide are we really having a revolution? Are we trying to break away from the King himself? And the answer here is yes. Male: Wow."
Social Studies,"And so this is the beginning of the Declaration of Independence and these three fellows on the right-hand side look very familiar. Walter: They're on the committee that the Congress appoints to draft the Declaration. Actually there were five people on the committee, but these of course are the three most important. Thomas Jefferson only 33 years old, by far the youngest person on the committee and he's chosen to write the first draft."
Social Studies,"Then Benjamin Franklin, who is a mentor of Jefferson's, a printer from Philadelphia. Franklin had just been spending the past two decades almost going back and forth to England to try to prevent a revolution. Then John Adams, the very passionate sage from the State of Massachusetts who was the one who was most in favor of revolution."
Social Studies,"In fact, when Franklin comes back to Philadelphia in early 1776 after having tried to hold Britain and America together most of these people didn't know whether he would be on the side of revolution or not. In fact, his own son, William Franklin, is, at this time of this Declaration, the Royal Governor of New Jersey and is staying loyal to King George. Male: And just to, once again emphasize the context, the Royal Governor of New Jersey. This wasn't like the Governor of New Jersey we imagine now."
Social Studies,"He wasn't elected by the people. He was appointed. Walter: No, he was appointed by the King. He was the Royal Governor, and you know Franklin was proud of his son, but they have this incredible split starting in 1776 where William Franklin remains loyal to the crown and loyal to King George the III who had made him Governor of New Jersey."
Social Studies,"Male: Now, one thing that you had mentioned a few seconds ago that I think is surprising is when you mentioned that Jefferson was 33 years old when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. How normal was that? You know back then it seemed like people did I guess mature faster, but he was still perceived as a fairly young person. Walter: Yes. They all loved to be thinking of themselves as young rebels too."
Social Studies,"In fact, Jefferson I think is the second youngest person in the Continental Congress, but there was a third person who lied about his age to pretend to be younger and actually wasn't. Jefferson was a good wordsmith. He was from Virginia and it was very important of this person from ... Franklin from Pennsylvania and Adams from Massachusetts to make sure we got Virginia in because Virginia, there was a chance it would remain loyal and ... Male: It was a large wealthy ..."
Social Studies,"Walter: A large wealthy land-owning colony and so getting the Virginians in, and there were very strong rebels from Virginia. The Lees of Virginia as well as Jefferson were in favor of declaring independence so they decide they want to make sure that Jefferson gets to write the first draft. Male: Interesting. And so what we see here, this is the final text. This is the official Declaration of Independence. Walter: Right. Male: In the future videos we can talk about previous drafts. Walter: Right."
Social Studies,"They went through five drafts to get to this draft and this is the one that they do after unaninously all 13 colonies, now called the 13 United States in this document, declare this to be the cause of the colonies. And what you can see in the first paragraph is they have to explain why are we writing this document."
Social Studies,"They say well if you're going to have a revolution, if you're going to dissolve the political bands which have connected you with another state, then the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them a decent respect. This is the equal station they get because of nature and nature's God. It's a pretty interesting phrase. Male: Let's read the whole thing. Walter: Yeah."
Social Studies,"Male: ""When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands,"" this is what you were talking about, ""which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them."" Walter: What they're saying right there is that the laws of nature and the fact that nature's God created us all equally means that one set of people don't have to be subserviant to or occupied by or colonies of another set of people."
Social Studies,"They want to be free and independent, and it's interesting that they use the phrase, ""Laws of nature and nature's God,"" because this is sort of the beginning of the enlightenment where we're supposed to understand that nature gives us our rights and reasons. John Locke, the great British philosopher, believed in the laws of nature, and these were deists."
Social Studies,"They kind of were religious a bit, but they didn't subscribe to any particular religious dogma, and so they just talk about nature's God allowing us all to be free and equal. Male: Right. ""A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to a separation."" So that's really just saying ... Walter: What they're saying is we care what the rest of you think."
Social Studies,"And by the way, it's directed at one particular people, the French, because we're not going to win this revolution in the United States unless the French help support us. The French, by the way, were already at war with the British. There's been a long set of wars throughout the 18th century where France and Britian were fighting each other."
Social Studies,"So, this document is particularly aimed at saying to the French, you've been fighting Britain for a long time so we have a decent respect for all the opinions of mankind, but yours in particular and we're going to tell you why we're fighting this and of course in France at the time this notion of liberty, equality, fraternity, that's bubbling up as well. So, the document is to try to persuade other nations please support us. We're explaining why we're having this revolution."
Social Studies,"Male: And that's I think important to remember for someone in 21st century America. It's obviously a major world power now, the major world power. But back then this was like a little colony. It's kind of a sideshow. Walter: Right, right. And it's important for us to remember now too that whenever we do something, whenever we get involved in the world we should have a decent respect to the opinions of mankind. Male: Right."
Social Studies,Walter: That's how we started as a nation saying when we do something we're going to be open. We're going to be honest. We're going to explain to you why..
Social Studies,"you have the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Paul Revere riding to say that the British are coming. They started to rebel against the taxes that Parliament has but on us. They're not quite clear what the rebellion is all about, especially those people who aren't up there in Massachusetts where the rebels are happening. By 1776, that's when they write the Declaration that says here's what we're doing."
Social Studies,"We're fighting a war of independence and ""let facts be submitted to a candid world,"" here's why we're doing it. Then you get, you're fighting the war, it's really not until 1781 that we win the war. Around that period, between 1776 and 1781, they've drafted this thing called the Articles of Confederation. It's sort of rules by which the States are going to get together and govern themselves. But it doesn't really create a new nation. It's really just a federation of the separate states."
Social Studies,"Male 1: This is really around this idea the Declaration of Independence is really, look, we're already essentially at war. This is why. This is articulating why we're at war, what we actually believe in, but that didn't establish a government, it didn't actually talk about what kind of government it would be, how it would govern itself, so the Articles were really this first attempt at saying, well, assuming that we're able to win this war of independence, how do we set up? Male 2: Right."
Social Studies,What they were during this war of independence were 13 separate states. They didn't really think of themselves as one new nation. Some people did.
Social Studies,"Ben Franklin and others thought we should really be a union of one nation, but when they get together to do the Articles of Confederation, really starting right after the Declaration is signed in 1776, they finish writing it in 1777, they write a pretty uninspiring document that just says we're from a whole lot of separate states and we're going to get together a bit and be a union of theses States, but we're not going to give ourselves many powers as one government. Male 1: Yeah, we have it right here."
Social Studies,"Actually, I'd never seen it before this conversation. I've obviously read about it when I was in history class, but ""To all to whom these presents ""shall come, we the undersigned Delegates of the ""States affix to our names send greeting."" Male 2: Oh, I mean it's like something written by a bad template. Male 1: To whom it may concern! (laughs) Male 2: It's not an inspiring document and it gives no power to a central government. As you say, it's the Delegates of the States."
Social Studies,"They ""affix our names"" to this and it's the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between these States. One of the main things they fail to do is give the central government any taxation power. So really it's up to the States to tax, and then this Congress that's meeting, based on the Articles of Confederation, tries to beg each one of the States, hey, requisition us a little bit of money so we can continue our business."
Social Studies,"Male 1: The Federal, the central government, does not directly, there's no Federal income tax, or not any tax of any kind, not even any kind of tax. The States can tax in whatever way they see fit and then they have to give something. Male 2: What's kind of amusing is we win the Revolution in the Battle of Yorktown. That's in 1781."
Social Studies,"A messenger comes riding into New York where this Congress has been meeting, it sort of floats from city to city, and gives them all the details and they don't even have enough money to pay the messenger. They have to reach in their pockets to do it. So you have this sort of poorly written document called the Articles of Confederation, that seems to make a confederation of States, meaning we're going to gather together but we're going to have our own separate powers and doesn't given any taxation powers."
Social Studies,"You have a kind of messy governance structure. Male 1: It's obviously not a perfect analogy, but if we take analogy to present-day, it's kind of what's happening in Europe where there's these separate nations, separate States, that are trying to form some type of union, not clear who has what power. The Central European Union is not directly taxing. Male 2: Precisely. That's a very good analogy to what was happening because they weren't quite clear whether they had a central currency or not back then."
Social Studies,"They weren't quite sure what are the powers of each of the States versus the central government, and that's been something throughout history. Even starting with the Greek city-states where you can have confederations and it's unclear how much power you're going to put in the central government versus how much power you're going to leave at the States. Male 1: Considering that this is not the governing document for us now, something must have broken to want to replace it. Male 2: Well, yes."
Social Studies,"By the time you're getting into 1786, it is totally clear that this document isn't working. You have all sorts of disputes. Like Maryland and Virginia are having this horrible dispute over navigation and border rights. They call an Annapolis Convention to try to fix that up and they try to get the States to come. Only five of them come."
Social Studies,"You have something up in Massachusetts called Shays' Rebellion where there was this rebellion of the poor farmers in western Massachusetts under a former Revolutionary War officer named Daniel Shays. It's sort of unclear what ... Male 1: His name was Shays? Male 2: Yeah. S-H-A-Y-S. Male 1: So it's Shays, the apostrophe's after ... Male: The apostrophe's after, yeah. Daniel Shays was his name. He leads a rebellion and there's no central government to send a force to stop them."
Social Studies,"Washington's army has been disbanded. So the poor people of Massachusetts have to try to raise a militia to try to stop Shays' Rebellion, but they can't get the Federal government to step in. It was just one of many, many symptoms that we were all disintegrating and falling apart. There was no rule of law that governed all the colonies, and now all the States."
Social Studies,"What happens is people like Hamilton, Madison, others get together and say, you know what? Congress is meeting, I think they were meeting in New York by then. We ought to go back to Philadelphia where this all began in 1776 with the Declaration of Independence and we should have a Constitutional Convention. We should write a whole new constitution to govern centrally this new nation. Most of the States agreed to come."
Social Studies,"Some of them worried about the fact that we were writing a whole new constitution, so they did not give their delegates authority to get rid of the Articles of Confederation. So when they began in that very hot summer of 1787, it was kind of unclear whether they were going to be able to write a new constitution or just try to amend the old Articles of Confederation."
Social Studies,"Male 1: This makes it clear that even after Shays' Rebellion, even after these border disputes between Maryland and Virginia, it still wasn't a done deal. A lot of States still liked their autonomy, liked their independence. So even going into this, it wasn't like everyone was unanimously saying hey, we need to give the federal government more power. Male 2: And by the way, what does that sound like? It sounds like the debates we're having today."
Social Studies,"Male 1: Exactly! (chuckles) Male 2: We still, as a nation, have always had these debates of how much power should be given to the central government, how much power should retain with the States, whether it's on healthcare or our laws or our taxation. It's a useful tension to have. Male 1: Absolutely. Then they are able to come up with a solution."
Social Studies,"Male 2: It's a very difficult problem of the big States wanting there to be proportional representation in a new Congress, the small States wanting equal votes per State. You finally have Ben Franklin again, once again being the person who works out the compromise to have both a House and a Senate, equal votes per State in the Senate, proportional representation in the House."
Social Studies,"They finally come together and they all agree to line up and sign this new Constitution that will give taxation authority to the Federal government, or to Congress, a new Congress, a Federal taxation authority and, by the way, that has a Preamble that's a whole lot more inspiring than that Articles of Confederatin thing-y that said, ""To all to whom these presents shall come."" Male 1: (laughing)To whom it may concern! Male 2: Let's look at the Preamble to the constitution."
Social Studies,"Male 1: ""We the people of the United States."" That's as opposed to ""To whom it may concern."" Male 2: Just look at those first three words. I mean those first three words are totally an inspiring thing. It's never been done before, which is ""We the people"" are getting to create this Constitution. It's not the States getting together to do it. It's not the king devolving authority. It's not a Parliament doing it. It's ""We the people"" gathered together here."
Social Studies,"We are the ones that are going to ordain, a nice religious word down there, ""ordain."" ""Do ordain and establish."" It's almost like we have the power. It's not coming from the divine right of kings or God, we the people get to ordain and establish this constitution. Male 1: We've made previous videos about the Declaration of Independence. The Articles of Confederation in no way share any of the spirit or the poetry of the Declaration, while this Preamble does. It seems almost a continuation of it."
Social Studies,"Male 2: Yeah, let's read it. ""We the people ""of the United States, in order to form a more ""perfect union."" That's a very transcendent phrase, but it also means, hey, the Articles of Confederation, we weren't really unified. We have to create a united States. We have to create a union. Male 1: And the ""more perfect,"" is that a direct reference to the Articles that that was a less perfect, or is this something else? Male 2: It's not a very good piece of grammar."
Social Studies,"As you know, things are either perfect or they're not. The notion of creating a more perfect union, yes, they are making a nod to the fact that we have been confederated under the Articles of Confederation, but now we have to create a more perfect union. We have to really hold together. Then they decide what's the purpose of this Constitution? First of all, establish justice. That means there'll be one common set of laws. Ensure domestic tranquility. This is Shay's Rebellion."
Social Studies,"It's still going on when they start writing this Preamble. Domestic tranquility means that the federal, the central government, has a right to raise an army and that in the end, the police and defense powers don't reside with just the individual States. There's going to be a more perfect union that helps ensure domestic tranquility and provide for the common defense. What you've had is the Continental Army under Washington has been disbanded. There's no way to raise taxes for a central army."
Social Studies,"Now we're saying that the union of States, the United States, the federal government, they're going to raise the money and provide for the common defense."
Social Studies,"There's another phrase, ""promote the general welfare."" When people argue about Contitutionalism and what gives the Federal government the right to do things, one of those phrases is every now and then we have to use the ""general welfare"" phrase and say whether it's healthcare or anything else, maybe there are things the central government does that promote the ""general welfare."" Then we get to the inspiring lines, the poetry as opposed to ""To all whom these presents shall come."" That's ""secure the blessings of liberty to ""ourselves and our posterity, we do ordain ""and establish this Constitution of the ""United States of America."" We've been calling ourselves that ever since the Declaration of Independence, but now it's in all caps and it's signifying we're one nation, not just 13 different States."
Social Studies,"Male 1: Previously I think the ""U"" wasn't capitalized. Man 2: Yeah, in some of the earlier documents it wasn't and we certainly were not united. It's only under this Constitution do we become, really, the United States of America.."
Social Studies,"Depending on how you view it, the American Revolution came first and kind of put out the principles of self-governance and why do we need kings and all of that. But the French Revolution was the first time that those type of principles really took foot in Europe and really overthrew a monarchy. So just to understand kind of the environment in which this began, let's talk about what France was like in 1789. Which most people kind of view as the beginning of the Revolution. One, France was poor."
Social Studies,"Now, you wouldn't think that France was poor, if you looked at Louis XVI, who was king of France. If you looked at Louis XVI, and the clothes he wore. If you looked at Marie-Antoinette, his wife, they don't look poor. They lived in the palace of Versailles, which is ginormous. It's this massive palace, it would compare to the greatest palaces in the world. They were living a lavish lifestyle. Just in case you want to know where this is, this is what's now almost a suburb of Paris."
Social Studies,"But at the time it was a village 20 or 30 kilometers away from Paris. So they don't seem to be poor. But the the actual government of France is poor. And when I say poor, they're in debt. They've just had two major military adventures. One was the American Revolution. They played a major part in supporting the revolutionaries. Because they wanted to stick it to their enemy, Great Britain. They wanted their empire to shrink a little bit. So France sent significant military help and resources."
Social Studies,"And you could imagine, that's not a cheap thing when you're doing it across the Atlantic Ocean. And even before the American Revolution, the Seven Years' War that ended in 1763, this really drained the amount of wealth that the French government had. And for those of you who are more American history focused, the Seven Years' War is really the same thing as the French and Indian War. The French and Indian War was the North American theater of the Seven Years' War."
Social Studies,"But the Seven Years' War is the more general term. Because there was also a conflict going on in Europe simultaneously. The French and Indian War and it was just part of that conflict. And the Seven Years' actually engulfed most of the powers of Europe at the time. So France had participated in this, ended in 1763, you had the American Revolution. Both of these really just drained the amount of funds that the government itself had. At the same time, the French people were starving."
Social Studies,"There was a generalized famine at the time. They weren't producing enough grain, people couldn't get their bread to eat. So you can imagine, when people are starving they're not happy. And to kind of add insult to injury, you would see your royals living like this. But even worse than the royals, who you don't see every day, you saw your nobility. Who is roughly a little over 1.5% of the population. But you saw the nobility really, really, living it up."
Social Studies,"And the nobility, just so you know, these are people with fancy titles who inherit land and wealth from generation to generation. They don't dress too differently from the king. And they essentially live in smaller versions of the palace of Versailles. And if you're a peasant, you work on their fields, do all the work, you send them some of your crops and they pay no taxes."
Social Studies,"So from your point of view, and it's not hard to understand why you would think this, these are essentially kind of parasites who are completely ignoring the fact that you are starving and you're paying all of the taxes. You can imagine people weren't too happy about that. And then to top it all off, you had all of these philosophers hanging around talking about the Enlightenment."
Social Studies,"And this is kind of the whole movement where people, and authors, and poets, and philosophers, are starting to realize that, gee, maybe we don't need kings. Maybe we don't need priests to tell us what it means to be good or bad. Maybe people could essentially rule themselves all of a sudden. And obviously, the biggest proof of the Enlightenment was the American Revolution. That was kind of the first example of people rising up and saying, we don't need these kings anymore. We want to govern ourselves."
Social Studies,"For the people, by the people. So you also had kind of this philosophical movement going around. Now if you ask me my opinion of what the biggest thing was, I think the people starving, you can never underestimate what people are willing to do when they're actually hungry. And, this is kind of more from the intellectual point of view. People said, oh there's Enlightenment movement here. So this is the state of France. They had a financial crisis."
Social Studies,"So a meeting was called, kind of an emergency meeting, of the major groups of France to try to resolve some of these problems. It's a fiscal crisis, people are starving, what do you do? So they called the Convocation of the Estates-General. Let me write that down. Which was a meeting of the three estates of France. Now what are the three estates of France? You can really just view them as the three major social classes of France. The First Estate was the clergy. The Second Estate is the nobility."
Social Studies,"And then the Third Estate is everyone else. And this gives you a sense of how skewed the power structure was. Because people kind of grouped the power as OK, these are the three groups and maybe they can vote against each other. But this was only 0.5% of the population, this is 1.5% of the population, this was 98% of the population. But these people had equal weight with these guys. But these people had the burden of most of the taxes."
Social Studies,"These are the people who are doing all the work, producing all of France's wealth, dying in the wars. But these guys, despite their small population, have more weight than everybody else. So you had the Convocation of the Estates-General, where representatives of these three estates met at the Palace of Versailles to essentially figure out what to do about this fiscal crisis. Now obviously, these people right here, the Third Estate, they were angry."
Social Studies,"They were like look, we've taken the burden on ourselves for much of the recent history of France. We're tired of you guys getting away with not paying taxes and just kind of leeching off of us. They were afraid that even more of the tax burden was going to be put on them. And the nobility, or the king, or the clergy, that they wouldn't have to make sacrifices. So they came in already angry. And so they really wanted to meet in one big room together. Because they actually had roughly 600 representatives."
Social Studies,"Which only the king at the last minute agreed to. Before, it was only going to be equal numbers of them. These guys had 300 roughly. These guys had 300 as well. These guys were able to say, hey we're 98% of the population, maybe we should have at least 600 representative. But even there, they wanted to meet in the same room. And essentially try to make it so it's one representative, one vote. But obviously these other estates, the clergy and the nobility, said no, let's each vote as estates."
Social Studies,"And at the end of the day, these guys lost. So they were essentially forced to kind of organize independently as a Third Estate. So that made them even angrier. So they met at an assembly hall and said, if these guys are going to ignore us, not only are we going to be in this room and start organizing ourselves. But we're not going to call this the Convocation of the Estates-General. We're going to declare that we are the National Assembly of France. That we represent the people."
Social Studies,"We are essentially going to become the parliamentary body of France. Instead of just being this emergency Convocation of the Estates-General. And they actually got some sympathy from some elements of the clergy and some elements of the nobility. Now obviously, Louis XVI was not amused by this whole turn of events. Here he was, he was an absolute monarch, which means that he held pretty much all of the power to do whatever he saw was fit."
Social Studies,"And all of a sudden you had this group of upstarts taking advantage of this emergency situation where he can't continue to buy as many silk robes as he was before. They're taking advantage of the situation to declare a National Assembly of France. To declare somehow that I'm not an absolute monarch. That my power is going to be taken by this assembly. So he wasn't happy. So when they took a break, he locked the door of the assembly room. So they couldn't get in."
Social Studies,"And he said, oh I think there needs to be some repairs in that room. Maybe you all can assemble later. And that was kind of his way of saying no. If you're declaring you're the National Assembly of France, I'm not going to even let you assemble. I'm not even going to let you get in the room. So that clearly didn't do a lot to make these guys, or in particular these guys, any happier. People are hungry. These people are living lavishly. They've already been not allowed to vote in one room together."
Social Studies,"When they vote in their own room, and declare themselves as representatives of the people of France, which they really are, the king locks the room, doesn't let them go in. So they go to an indoor tennis court in Versailles. This is a picture of it right here. This is an indoor tennis court. And that gives you an idea of how lavish Versailles was, that it had an indoor tennis court in the late 1700s. And they proclaimed the Tennis Court Oath."
Social Studies,"Where they proclaimed, not are we only the National Assembly of France, but even more than that, we all pledge to not stop until we create a constitution of France. So they went from being a National Assembly to essentially morphing into a constituent assembly. We're going to create a constitution. And they had sympathy from some elements of the clergy and the nobility. So eventually Louis XVI, he kind of saw the writing on the wall. The people are angry."
Social Studies,"And every time he tries to mess with them, they only get angrier. And they only go to even more extreme measures. So just to kind of make it seem like he's going along, he says, OK that's cool, guys. Whatever you all want to do. Yeah, maybe I'm open to it, we are in an emergency. And maybe it is unreasonable, I have been a little bit unreasonable. So he lets them be, he lets them assemble again. But while that's happening, people start to notice that troops are converging on Paris."
Social Studies,"And they're obviously being sent there by the king. And not only are they just any troops, a lot of the actual troops, even though they are French troops, there under the authority of France's military. They're actually foreign troops. So, if you think about it, these would be the ideal types of troops to put down any type of insurgency, or any type of rebellion. Or even better, to go in and dissolve the National Assembly. So people start getting a little bit paranoid, you can imagine."
Social Studies,"Now on top of that, Louis XVI's main financial adviser, Necker, Jacques Necker. He was sympathetic to the Third Estate, to the plight of the Third Estate. And he said hey, Mr. King, I think it's reasonable for you to essentially budget your expenses a little bit better. And maybe a little bit less of a lavish lifestyle. Considering the state of the government's budget. And the state of the people of France, they're starving."
Social Studies,"Why don't you do that a little bit? But Louis XVI, instead of taking his advice, he fired him. He fired the financial adviser. So taken together, troops are converging on Paris, you have this Tennis Court Oath, Louis XVI has fired his adviser, people are going hungry. They're genuinely going hungry. People in Paris said, the king is going to try to suppress us again, this is no good. And especially if he does it with troops, we have to arm ourselves. So they stormed the Bastille."
Social Studies,"This right here is a picture of the Bastille. And this is most famous, when you when you first learn about it, or maybe this is the first time you're learning about it. They put political prisoners there and they freed the political prisoners. But in reality, there were only seven prisoners in the Bastille. So it's not like thousands and thousands of political prisoners were being held there and there were freed."
Social Studies,"The real value of the Bastille to the revolutionaries, we could say, is that there were weapons there. There was a major arms cache there. And so by storming the Bastille and getting the weapons, they all of a sudden could essentially fend off any type of threat that the troops would have. But this is also kind of the very beginning of the real chaos of the French Revolution. And as we're going to see over the next several years, the chaos only gets worse and worse."
Social Studies,"It's almost on a lot of levels a lot worse than the American Revolution. Because what actually happened in the cities and what fellow Frenchman started doing to do each other was really on many levels barbaric. And you actually saw it here for the first time, where the governor of the Bastille, the guy who was in charge of it, he had the standoff between the troops. And he eventually called for a ceasefire. Because he's like, oh there's too much bloodshed."
Social Studies,"But once the revolutionaries got to him, they stabbed them, they cut his head off, and they put it on a pike. Then they went back to the mayor of Paris, they shot him. So clearly, things were really getting out of hand. But most people associate the storming of the Bastille as kind of the landmark event of the French Revolution. Even today, people celebrate Bastille Day. And that is July 14, 1789."
Social Studies,"So just to give you a sense of how quickly all of this happened, the Convocation of the Estates-General, that was in May. The Tennis Court Oath was in June. And then in July, you have the storming of the Bastille. And then in August, just to kind of complete the idea that we are definitely in a revolutionary period. The National Assembly, that started off at the tennis courts with the Third Estate, they declared their equivalent of the Declaration of Independence."
Social Studies,"They declared their Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Which was essentially their version of the Declaration of Independence. And it essentially put everything into question of what is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? I'm using words from the American Revolution. But this was their Declaration of Independence. It wasn't a constitution, it was just a statement of the things that they think need to govern any type of constitution or country."
Social Studies,"Or the ideas that any country should be based on. So I'm going to leave you there. We've really now started the French Revolution. And now, you're going to see that over the next several years, it's only going to get bloodier and bloodier and even more complex. And when everything is said and done, it's actually not going to end that well in terms of giving people liberty.."
Social Studies,"Then things continued to be tense. There were uprisings. The king didn't know what to do. He obviously didn't like the situation. People became more and more suspicious of the king. Nobles were leaving the country, they were emigrating out of France. The king and queen themselves started to get paranoid that, gee, you know, maybe people have even more radical notions than this constitutional monarchy. Maybe we ourselves should escape. So then we saw in 1791-- and let me write this all down in a timeline."
Social Studies,"We're now in 1791. And this is review of the last video. June, we saw the royals try to escape. But they're captured in Varennes and they're sent back to Paris to essentially to be in house arrest in the Tuileries. This is the building right here, it doesn't exist anymore. But if you go to Paris and if you visit the Louvre, you'll see the Louvre opens across the street into the Tuileries Garden. And this is where that building used to be. So the royals end up in house arrest at the Tuileries."
Social Studies,"This was in June. Then, in July in 1791, once again, all review from the last video. People said, hey they tried to escape, that's equivalent to abdication of the throne. They don't even want to be our king and queen and we don't need kings and queens to begin with. So the most radical elements, the most radical leftist elements, in particular the Jacobins, they started getting petitions in the Champ-de-Mars to essentially get people to say, we don't need a royalty anymore. We just need a republic."
Social Studies,"We need a state without kings and queens. But then, the National Assembly sent in some troops. Things got ugly. Rocks were thrown, shots were fired, 50 people died. And you have the Champ-de-Mars Massacre. So things are really, really heating up. And then we saw at the end of 1791, to make things even worse, we're not even at the end. In August, we had the Declaration of Pillnitz, which we saw was the rulers of Austria and Prussia saying that they don't like what's happening to the royals in France."
Social Studies,"And for obvious reasons. Well one, Leopold II was the brother of Marie-Antoinette. But even more profound, they didn't like this notion of people rising up against royalty. That might give people in their own empires, or in their own countries ideas about what to do with them. So even though this might have not been taken seriously, this was just a declaration by these guys. This made people in France even more paranoid."
Social Studies,"Now, while all of this was happening, you might have remembered the Tennis Court Oath that occurred several years ago. Where they said we promise to create a constitution. And so a constitution does get created. So in 1791, the National Assembly, or the constituent assembly, actually does create a constitution of 1791, which establishes France as a constitutional monarchy. So they're saying, yeah, we'll still have a king. But it'll be more of a figure head. Not necessarily someone who can create laws."
Social Studies,"The National Assembly will be responsible for that. The king will get a few abilities to veto legislation and whatnot. But most of their powers are removed. So this was a constitutional monarchy. And it's really along the lines of what was already going on in Great Britain. But this, on some levels, it's a major achievement. They had that oath to create a constitution. But on a whole other level, things are getting so ugly in France, and in particular, in Paris."
Social Studies,"The Revolution was really focused on what was going on in Paris and Versailles. Things were getting so ugly that this is the starting to become a sideshow. And to some degree, the revolutionaries have gone beyond wanting just a constitutional monarchy. They're starting to think about wanting a republic. We saw that during the Champ-de-Mars Massacre. People started signing signatures to actually have a republic. And then were fired on, which probably makes them want to have a republic even more."
Social Studies,"Now the other thing you might remember from the very first video, is the thing that really precipitated this whole Revolution. Or at least in my mind, one of the main things that precipitated this whole Revolution is that France was broke. And people are going hungry. This is happening the whole time while all these politicians and revolutionaries and royalties are moving around and trying to kind of strategize their position. No one has solved either of these problems the entire time."
Social Studies,"There is no money in France. There is a famine, people are going hungry. And so pretty much everyone, whether you look at Louis XVI, let me look at him again, it's always nice to remember what he looked like. Whether you're talking about Louis XVI, who's now in house arrest. Or whether you're talking about many of the revolutionaries, everyone starts to say, gee, how can we solve this problem? People are going to throw us out if we don't solve this problem of hunger and being broke."
Social Studies,"So as you'll see in history many times, the best solution for that, or the perceived best solution, is to start a war. So they declare war on Austria. And if you think about it from Louis XVI's point of view, he thought of it as kind of a win-win situation. If the war is successful, and he kind of threw his weight behind the war. And this happened-- let me write down the dates. That always helps me frame where it happens. So this was kind of ending 1791, and then war is declared in April, this is now 1792."
Social Studies,"And then this, right here, is in April. And if you think about it, this was a win-win, or at least from Louis XVI's point of view, it was a win-win. If they did will well in the war, it might make him more popular, might make him stronger. They might be able to plunder the wealth of other countries to help to build France's coffer. If the war goes badly and France loses, then what's going to happen? Then you're going to have Austria and probably the other people you're at war with."
Social Studies,"We'll see very quickly, France is going to be at war with most of the powers of Europe. But if you lose the war, these powers, which are controlled by monarchs, they're going to essentially get rid of the revolutionaries and probably put Louis XVI back in power. So from Louis XVI's point of view, it was a good idea. And for a lot of the revolutionaries, they wanted to solve these two problems. So they said, hey yeah, that would be good if we could plunder other countries."
Social Studies,"If we could steal grain from other countries to make at least the French less hungry. And maybe we can spread the Revolution. We can topple all of these other kings. This won't just be a French Revolution, this will be an all of Europe Revolution. So they declared war on Austria. Very quickly, they tried to attack the Austrian Netherlands, which was kind of disjoint from the rest of Austria. So they attacked right there into the Austrian Netherlands. Although they got kind of bogged down there."
Social Studies,"It wasn't as successful as they thought it would be. And Prussia, which as you might remember, participated in the Declaration of Pillnitz, decided to enter the war on the side of Austria. So Prussia attacks and at first, it's pretty, pretty successful. It's able to make some headway into France. And then the general in charge of the Prussian army, the Duke of Brunswick, he makes the Brunswick Manifesto. Let me write that down."
Social Studies,"Which is essentially just like the Declaration of Pillnitz, but it has a lot more teeth behind it now. Because this dude, the Duke of Brunswick, he's actually, he's got an army invading France. And he declares, his manifesto is saying, I intend to overthrow this whole revolutionary government. And I intend to install the king again. All of this happened in April of 1792. Declare war on Austria seemed like a win-win for the king."
Social Studies,"The revolutionaries wanted to spread the Revolution and plunder other countries. And then immediately, Prussia jumps in, starts attacking France, and says we're going to install the king. So you could imagine, this is making the revolutionaries even more paranoid about what the king is up to. They think that the king has some type of secret deal with the Prussians, or with the other enemies that they're going up against. So in August of 1792, it's only a few months later, four or five months later."
Social Studies,"In August of 1792, you essentially had the Commune of Paris. And when I say the Commune of Paris, it's really the government of Paris at this time. And it's been taken over by even more revolutionary people, mainly Jacobins. And they storm where the royal family is staying, at the Tuileries, which is that building right here. And this painting right here is a depiction of the revolutionaries, mainly Jacobins, who are actually storming the Tuileries. And they imprison Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette."
Social Studies,"Because they're like, hey the Prussians have an army, and they've already declared the intention to install the king. We're going to imprison the king because we don't know what he's up do. So they imprison-- my spelling-- imprison Louis XIV and Marie-Antoinette. And they're also able to do some machinations within the actual National Assembly. And there's actually a rump session of the National Assembly, which means that a lot of the opponents weren't there."
Social Studies,"So it was a session where it was mainly the leftists, the radicals, the Jacobins were there. And so in August at that rump session, the assembly declares a republic. Which is equivalent to saying that Louis XVI is no longer king. And this nation we have, or this country we now have, will never have a king. It is now a republic. It as a government without a king. And while all of this was happening, you have these gangs kind of going around the region around Paris."
Social Studies,"And they're just trying and killing people that just seem to be suspicious, seem to be allied in some way with the nobility or with the king, or in someway a royalist. They want eventually for the monarchy to come back. And in those riots, in those arbitrary executions and killings, they actually ended up killing over 1,400 people. 1,400 executed at this time. So you can see, things are getting uglier and uglier and uglier. The king is imprisoned."
Social Studies,"And you're going to see that he's not going to be imprisoned long. But it's not going to end well for him. And essentially, the revolutionaries have said France is now a republic. All while they're at war with two major powers, with the Austrians and the Prussians. Now they are eventually able to hold off, and when I say they, I'm talking about armies of France. They are eventually able to hold off the invading Prussian army. They call it the Stalemate of Valmy, not clear who won."
Social Studies,"The Prussians weren't that eager to go into France. So they didn't push too hard or send too many more troops. So for at least temporarily, the external threat was diffused, if you want to call it that way. And so the National Assembly went forth and said-- they got rid of-- I mean, they had already declared a republic. But they went even further. So this is now, we're in September of 1792. You had the Stalemate at Valmy."
Social Studies,"And then the National Assembly, or the National Convention said, hey, we're going to create a new constitution. So that constitution of 1791 did not last too long. It lasted about a year. So a new constitution. The intent is to create a new constitution. Now, while all that's said, this bloodshed that we saw after they imprisoned Louis XVI, these kind of riots in Paris and these arbitrary killings, this is just a foreshadowing of much worse that's going to come in the very next year."
Social Studies,"By 1793-- let me write this down in a bloody color. So 1793 we're in now. So the National Assembly, the first thing that they do, or maybe I should say even more particular. In January of 1793, remember they've already deposed the king, they have him imprisoned, they're at war with these other countries that have stated the intention to put the king back into power. So the first thing they do is they execute Louis XVI. And this is a picture of the execution. He was guillotined."
Social Studies,"And this right here is Doctor Guillotine. And it was actually invented, this right here is the guillotine, and it was actually invented as a more humane way to kill people. At the time they said, when we kill people, it's not for them to feel pain, it's more to just kill them. So we'll use this very humane instrument called the guillotine. Where you use a blade to very quickly chop off someone's head. And it was invented by this physician right here."
Social Studies,"But, the one of the first important people they got to try it out was Louis XVI, guillotined in January. And then in February, remember people are still going hungry, they're still eager to spread the Revolution, they still want to plunder other countries. So in February, the National Assembly, or the National Council, the revolutionary government, declares war on Britain and the Dutch Republic. You don't know who this is, I'm going to tell you in a second. And Dutch Republic."
Social Studies,"Now you're probably saying, gee, how does France, this one country right here, how is it able to have war against Austria, Prussia? Now declaring war against the Dutch and Great Britain. And actually the month before, Spain and Portugal had declared war, had kind of jumped in on the side of Austria and Prussia."
Social Studies,"So how does this one country, France, how does this one revolutionary government fend itself off against the armies of so many nations? And the answer to that is that the revolutionary government declared in February what they called the Levee en Masse. And I'm not French, so I'm saying it wrong, I'm sure. Which was essentially the first version of what we now call the draft. And they were able to actually, they actually said every able-bodied young man in France who was unmarried will now be in the army."
Social Studies,"And so they were able to immediately raise several hundreds of thousands of soldiers. And actually within a couple of years, there's several accounts of it, but it might have been over one million plus soldiers. Which is very different from how many of these other kingdoms would raise their armies. They would pay salaries to professional soldiers."
Social Studies,"So these at the time were smaller armies than what France was able to muster up through the revolutionary government saying look, this is a government for the people by the people. So now you're not fighting for a king, you're fighting for yourself. You're fighting for your own representation so you don't get so subjected by foreign kings. So everyone jumped in the war effort. So they essentially had the largest army in Europe."
Social Studies,"But I keep repeating, all of this was in the context of unrest throughout France. There were royalists out there wanting to be counter revolutionaries. People were going hungry. So to kind of, I guess, clamp down on things, in April of 1792, the National Assembly created the Committee of Public Safety, which sounds like a very nice committee. And they essentially become the default government, or we can say the de facto government."
Social Studies,"And it was put in control of this nice looking gentleman right here, Maximilien Robespierre. Seems like a very civilized fellow. But really what the Committee of Public Safety was good at was being hugely political, hugely paranoid."
Social Studies,"And under especially Maximilien Robespierre's control, who was especially paranoid, anyone-- if they just caught a whiff of someone being not radical enough, or maybe too radical, or someone I just didn't like, or someone who might help depose me-- they just started guillotining people. So this is really the start of the Reign of Terror. So roughly over the next year, on the order of, give or take, 16,000 people are guillotined. They go to Doctor Guillotine's humane invention."
Social Studies,"And they are only estimates of this. There wasn't good accounting of this. But it's believed that as many as 40,000 people were summarily executed. Which essentially means you're guilty of this, I know you're guilty, hey, you over there with a gun, please shoot this person for me. So this was an extremely bloody time. And just so you imagine, most of this was occurring in and around Paris."
Social Studies,"So all of a sudden, in one little city, it was a major city, but you have tens of thousands of people being massacred, just if this guy, or the people who are plotting with this guy, or the people who are plotting against this guy, thought or caught a whiff of you being not completely loyal to the Revolution. Now eventually, people eventually got suspicious of Maximilien Robespierre. They're saying, hey, all your paranoia is hurting the Revolution more than helping it."
Social Studies,"So then in the Thermidorian Reaction-- it sounds like it's some type of a refrigerator or heater. Now this right here, this is in July of 1794. And it's called the Thermidorian Reaction, and I might do a whole video on this, because the revolutionary government, they actually created a new calendar. Where they renamed the month Thermidor, which was essentially July, it was shifted a little bit. And actually, it changed the number of hours in the day."
Social Studies,"They would have 10 hours a day, 100 minutes an hour, 100 seconds a minute. They would have three 10-day weeks per month. So they had this whole calendar. But Thermidor was the month of July. So it was really the July Reaction, where people got sick of Maximilien Robespierre. So in 1794, July 1794, he too. So what goes around comes around. So this right here, this is 1794, July. This right here is this nice-looking gentleman, and he, too, gets guillotined."
Social Studies,"Now, there's two other things that I want to point out. I'll take a few steps back into 1793. Just as a maybe a bit of a footnote. We saw that in January Louis XVI was executed for, I guess, depending on your opinion whether it was a good or a bad thing. In October Marie-Antoinette also executed. So this is in 1793, also executed. So nine months after her husband, executed. And then as one kind of small footnote at this point, as you can imagine, all of France was in unrest at the time."
Social Studies,"And then in 1793, there was a revolt. This was in July of 1793. So it's a year before the end of the Reign of Terror, really during the Reign of Terror. In the port of Toulon, there was a revolt against the revolutionary government. And it was put down, mainly with the help of an aspiring artillery captain. An artillery captain is someone who's essentially in charge of the cannons."
Social Studies,"And that artillery captain, who was able to help put down that revolt, and get a lot of, I guess, cred with the revolutionary government, his name was-- I need to write it someplace nice and new, and this is for foreshadowing of the next video-- so in July of 1793, in Toulon, a new artillery captain started to look like he really knows what he's doing. And his name is Napoleon Bonaparte. And he's going to have a lot to do with the next video.."
Social Studies,"Then we go into 1795. France is doing well in its wars with essentially the rest of Europe. And peace is declared with Prussia and Spain. So the only two major enemies left are Great Britain and Austria. So slowly, France is dealing with its enemies. And this was essentially a victory for France. So France victorious with this huge citizen army that it created. And then this was in April of 1795."
Social Studies,"And then in August of 1795-- let me do that in a different color-- in August of 1795, the new republic constitution gets approved. And it gets ratified through a vote of the people, which makes France officially a republic. They don't need kings anymore. And it set up a governing structure where the executive was essentially this group five directors. So the executive is called the Directory. So you don't have one president, you had five directors."
Social Studies,"And then the legislature, and this was significant because this was the first bicameral legislature for France, it had two houses. It had the Council of 500, which is analogous to the U.S. House of Representatives. It had 500 members in it, 500 representatives. Let me write that down. It was by bicameral. It had two houses, just like the U.S. Congress. So it's Council of 500. And then you had your Counsel of Elders, which had 250 representatives. And that, if you want to view it from a U.S."
Social Studies,"point of view, that was analogous to the U.S. Senate. And the Directory, the directors, the candidates were submitted by the Council of 500 to of the Council of Elders, who then picked the five directors-- the five people who would essentially be the executive in France. Already, things are looking really well. But, even though they had the military victories, there was still a lot of unrest. You still had Royalist out there. You still had Great Britain causing trouble."
Social Studies,"Great Britain was attacking the western regions of France. There were Royalists throughout Paris. And then, in October of 1795, there was a Royalist uprising. And Royalists are the people who wanted to bring back the crown. Or they were against the revolutionary government. And to a large degree, they weren't just upset about the fact that the royalty is gone. There were also upset that they were excluded from the Directory. So it excluded the Royalists."
Social Studies,"So before the Directory could even form in any major way, you had a Royalist uprising in Paris. And they stormed the Tuileries. This is the same place that you might remember earlier on, a couple of videos ago, where the king and queen were in house arrest. And later, they were assaulted by the revolutionary government. That was this painting right here. This was only three years ago. This was in 1792 and this is when they actually took the king and queen prisoner."
Social Studies,"And then they executed Louis XVI only a few months after that. So now it was on the other way. Instead of the royalty being in the Tuileries, and being sieged by the revolutionaries, the revolutionary government was in the Tuileries and it was being sieged by Royalists. And actually, the situation did not look good for the revolutionary government. They were out numbered. It looked like the Royalists had better numbers."
Social Studies,"But lucky for the revolutionary government, there was a young, very ambitious, very egotistical, military captain at this point, who had observed the Siege of the Tuileries when Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette were captured. And back then, he made a mental note. He said, they would have been able to stop the siege if only they had good artillery. Remember, he was an artillery captain. That's where he first became famous."
Social Studies,"In the Siege of Toulon he was able to use artillery effectively to suppress a rebellion. So he was actually observing this scene three years later. And now, in 1795, as the revolutionary government is in the Tuileries and the Royalists are about to essentially take it over, Napoleon, using what he learned when he observed the first time, he was able to place cannons and artillery in such a way. And he shot what they call grapeshot. And it's essentially like a shotgun coming out of a canon."
Social Studies,"And even though they were significantly outnumbered by the Royalists, he was essentially able to mow them down with the canons. So even though you had more numbers, you had all these cannons. Let me draw one. You had a canon and the actual ammunition would have these little pellets. That's why it was called grapeshot, it looked like a bundle of grapes. And when you shot it out, it would go in every direction. So you could imagine, it would just mow down whoever is in the way of the canon."
Social Studies,"And so essentially, Napoleon was able to save the revolutionary government. And allow the actual Directory to come to power. So this once again, Napoleon was in the right place at the right time. And he was very competent in military tactics. By all measure he was egotistical, he narcisistic, but the dude knew what he was doing. And so Napoleon becomes even more famous. This event, October 5, 1795 where Napoleon is able to defend the revolutionary government, this is know as 13 Vendemiaire."
Social Studies,"I know I'm saying it wrong. But once again, this was the month of October in the new French Revolutionary Calendar. But it made Napoleon even more of a national hero, or even revolutionary hero. People are starting to realize that this guy, he definitely knows what he's doing. But you could imagine at the same time, the Directory really didn't like this dude hanging around too close to the seats of power. He was obviously ambitious. He was obviously competent."
Social Studies,"And at some point, he might be a threat himself to the Directory. So they gave him power. But they made sure that he was far away from France. So he was essentially put in charge of the campaign into Italy. Remember, we're still fighting Austria and Great Britain. So we're fighting Austria in Italy. And Napoleon is made a Commander in Chief of the Italian forces. And he's tremendously successful. This was kind of the least important front of the war with Austria at this point."
Social Studies,"But out of all of the generals of the different fronts, Napoleon is the one that proves himself to be tremendously innovative and tactical and an all-route good general. So this Napoleon kicking butt in Italy. So once again, he becomes even more famous, even more well known. Eventually, Austria admits that hey gee, we're not going to beat the French anymore. They're really taking care of us quite well. And they make peace with the French in October of 1797. The Italian campaign occurred in 1796."
Social Studies,"So he defended the revolutionary government in 1795. He kicks butt in 1796 in Italy. In 1797 there's peace with Austria. So you only have Great Britain left. But this peace with Austria is actually going to be very temporary. This is from the Treaty of Campo-Formio. Let me write that down. And once again, this was peace with Austria. But France was the victor. So this is another French victory. And the only real enemy left was Great Britain."
Social Studies,"But the main problem was that Great Britain had the dominant navy in the world at the time. So France, and especially Napoleon, wasn't in a position to confront Great Britain on the water. And this was kind of a controversial decision. In 1798-- and remember, the Directory really didn't want Napoleon hanging around France. They're like OK, you're hugely popular, you're a good general, you're a great general. You go do what you want. Whatever you think is proper."
Social Studies,"So Napoleon gets it into his head to attack Egypt. And people aren't 100% sure what was the main strategic goal of attacking Egypt. So in 1798, he leaves from Toulon. Remember Toulon was the port that he helped suppress. He leaves from Toulon, he takes Malta along the way. And then eventually, he arrives in Egypt to essentially take over Egypt. And people believe that his desire to take over Egypt was essentially to, at some point, undermine the British in India."
Social Studies,"He'd maybe make some Muslim allies in Egypt and then maybe befriend some of the Muslim insurgents, if you will. Especially they were talking about Tipu Sultan, who he wanted to meet up with and maybe help undermine the British in India. But people aren't quite sure. It might have been just Napoleon having some visions of grandeur. And he wanted to go to Egypt because Egypt was a formerly great empire. So in 1798, Napoleon goes to Egypt. These are paintings of him in Egypt."
Social Studies,"And once again, he was able to kind of route the Mamluk forces who are in power at the time in Egypt. This is the Battle of the Pyramids. Once again, Napoleon is hugely successful. Except for one problem. He brings his 20,000 troops into Egypt, obviously by ship. They're sitting here, they're kicking butt in Egypt. But they're still at war with the British. So what the British do, with their dominant Navy, they send Horatio Nelson in charge of a fleet. And he comes here where the French navy was parked."
Social Studies,"And he just destroys them. So Horatio Nelson destroys the French fleet in the Battle of the Nile. And this is a depiction. This is Horatio Nelson right here. This is a depiction of the Battle of the Nile, which essentially strands Napoleon's 20,000-person army. They're stuck in Egypt. So not knowing what else to do-- they can't leave with all of their forces-- Napoleon then goes into Damascus and Syria. And then he causes all sorts of havoc in raping and pillaging and whatnot."
Social Studies,"But still that kind of begs the question of, how are they going to get back? And you could imagine, for someone as ambitious and egotistical as Napoleon, he didn't really care a lot about what happened to his troops. And so when an opportunity arose in 1799, he left. He left his entire army. This gives you a lot of view into Napoleon's character, that he was willing to leave his entire army in Egypt and in Syria to essentially be left to die at the hands of the Ottomans."
Social Studies,"And then he sneaks his way back to France. So in 1799, Napoleon goes back to France. Let me write this down. And once he gets back there, he sees that the Directory is unbelievably unpopular. And the main reason is the reason that every government in France throughout this whole series of videos has been unpopular. People are still hungry. France is still poor."
Social Studies,"Notice in everything I've talked about, in all of these videos, we still haven't addressed the issue that France is essentially broke and that people are still going hungry. So throughout all of the violence, all of the wars, the Directory is hugely unpopular. And then a few of the directors, two in particular, actually three of the directors, want to plot with Napoleon, who was hugely popular. And they essentially plan a coup. And the way that they allow themselves to come to power is they resign."
Social Studies,"And then they tell the legislature that's meeting at the Tuileries, hey, there's a Jacobian revolt and you're in danger. Why don't you go to this estate west of Paris. So that's Paris, where they normally meet. They tell them to go to an estate west of Paris. So the legislature goes here to this estate. And you'll be protected by Napoleon. And they're protected by Napoleon and his army. Now once they're there, Napoleon goes in and starts making these speeches about you guys being essentially illegitimate."
Social Studies,"And he looks like he really wants to take power. And they just jostle him out of the room. But once he gets jostled out of the room, his brother points to the bruises on Napoleon. He tells the guards outside of where the legislature is meeting, hey those guys in there, they're becoming violent. You have to go in there and take order. So that convinces the military. And they go in and they essentially dissolve the Council of 500."
Social Studies,"So essentially, you've dissolved the legislature, Napoleon is in charge of the military that dissolved the legislature. And so that allowed Napoleon and two of the plotting directors to take power. They became the three consuls of France. They form the Consulate, or the new executive of France. And very shortly they'll have their own constitution. But this really marks the point where Napoleon takes power of France."
Social Studies,"Because even though he took power with these other two dudes, he eventually is able to scheme his way to be called First Consul. At which point he is the authoritarian ruler of France. So we've gone from, over the course of the French Revolution, from 1789 where we had an absolute monarch in Louis XVI, now we go all the way to 1799, 10 years later, after all of this bloodshed, after multiple revolutions and counter revolutions. We end up with Napoleon, essentially being in charge of France.."
Social Studies,"So you might remember from 1792 to 1797, you had your war of the First Coalition. And the players there were Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain. I'll just write Britain for short. And this was essentially started by the French. You might remember, King Louis XVI was alive then. He supported the war, because he thought that they would lose and maybe reinstate him. Or that it would make him popular. The revolutionaries liked the war because they wanted to spread the Revolution."
Social Studies,"And you might remember it ended at the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, due mainly to Napoleon's victories in Italy. At that time, he was in charge of the Italian campaign. And the government of France at that time was the Directory. In power to a large degree because of Napoleon's ability to defend them. Then from 1798-- let me do this in a different color-- from 1798 to 1802, you have the Second Coalition. Now you might immediately see, Napoleon took power at the end of 1799."
Social Studies,"So this war spanned some of the Directory being in control and some of Napoleon as First Consul being in control. And here the players-- once again you have Austria and Great Britain-- they tend to be always at war with France at this period, especially Great Britain. And instead of Prussia, you have Russia. And actually, just to help you visualize what the Austrian Empire looked like at this time-- and the Prussian Empire, this map doesn't do it justice. Let me go down to this map. That's in 1810."
Social Studies,"Let me go a little bit earlier here. This is in 1805. And I'll draw the boundaries a little bit bolder than they did. So this is France. These are the boundaries of France. Actually, it was able to take some territory in what is now Italy. I could do the whole boundary if you like, but I think you get the idea. But the one empire that existed then that doesn't exist in its current form, was Prussia. Doesn't even exist at all."
Social Studies,"There is no Prussian Empire, or Prussian nation, or the country of Prussia anymore. You can see there it had some overlap with Germany, some overlap with Poland, some other countries, won't go into detail there. Then you have the Austrian Empire. Austrian Empire is right over there. As you can see, it encompasses much more than just the modern nation or country of Austria. Then you have the Russian Empire, which, give or take, looks not too different than Russia today."
Social Studies,"But the big difference between the world-- there's many differences-- between the world now and the world then was that there was no nation of Germany. You had a bunch of people speaking German, but they were divided into a bunch of small little states. This map doesn't show it. Some of them were under Austrian control, some of them were under Prussian control. And this loose confederation of German kingdoms and states, this was called the Holy Roman Empire. Let me write that down."
Social Studies,"And as Voltaire famously said, they were neither holy, nor Roman-- they didn't speak Latin, they weren't Italian, they were German. It wasn't holy, this wasn't controlled by a religious figure. And it wasn't an empire, it wasn't a tightly-controlled state that was kind of expanding its boundaries. It was just a loose confederation of kingdoms. So that gives you a visualization of what the world looked like right then. So with that in mind, let me go back to my overview. Right there."
Social Studies,"And then the Second Coalition, in 1801 you had the Treaty of Luneville. Once again, this was a defeat of the Austrians, mainly due to the military capabilities. Napoleon was now in charge of France. But he led once again, an Italian campaign against the Austrians. This is his victory in Marengo right there. I'll go into a little more detail on that. And that essentially declared victory on Austria, allowed Napoleon to take more territory along the Italian peninsula. You can see it right there."
Social Studies,"And then later he had the Treaty of Amiens with the British in 1802. And that really ended the coalition. I guess you could say the coalition ended in 1801, because Austria was out of it. Russia was kind of just passively observing. They participated. But they didn't really give or take or lose anything. And then I could say at this point the United Kingdom, essentially I guess the best explanation of why that it was war fatigue. But we'll see that they weren't tired for long."
Social Studies,"Because then in May of 1803, you have the beginning of your Third Coalition . And then I'll go to a little bit more detail about this. The Third Coalition, Britain declares war on what we could call the French Empire. And this isn't going to end until 1805. So you can see, Great Britain is essentially at war almost continuously. There's a few gaps give or take. But there's always this tension. This is the Third Coalition."
Social Studies,"And once again, I could write the United Kingdom if you like, because they actually now are the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. You have the United Kingdom in there, we have Russia in there. And once again, we have Austria. And there were other players. There was Portugal. But these were the prime players. And we'll see in this video that this, the war of the Third Coalition, really ended with Napoleon being the dominant power in Europe."
Social Studies,"And ended with him essentially thinking that he is unstoppable. So I'll do a little bit more detail on that. This resulted in 1805, with the then Emperor Napoleon. And we'll talk about how he became emperor. But in 1805, Napoleon-- maybe I should say 1806, because this ended at the end of 1805-- Napoleon views himself as unstoppable, as invincible. He got some good victories that fed his already large ego."
Social Studies,"So with this as an overview, let's review a little bit of the life of Napoleon and the roles that he directly played in pretty much all of these conflicts. So the first time we heard about Napoleon was in 1793. And I'll just draw it right here. You're might remember, there were all of these Royalist insurrections going on against the revolutionary government. And they had this bright artillery captain in Toulon who put down an uprising there in 1793."
Social Studies,"He got some, I guess you could say, France-wide, or nationwide fame from doing that. Then in 1795, you might remember, the Directory was trying to get formed in Paris. So this is 1793. Then in 1795-- let me do a better color than that. That's hard to read. In 1795, he defended the Tuileries by essentially sending out that grapeshot and mowing down people to keep the Royalists from taking out the revolutionary government. So once again, hugely, hugely popular."
Social Studies,"So all of that was occurring during the war of the First Coalition. And then Napoleon was made the general in charge of the Italian campaign. And in 1797, he was essentially able to end the war of the First Coalition in a victorious way for France by defeating Austria and Italy. And that ended the First Coalition with the Campo Formio. This was Napoleon. Then, you might remember, OK, he's this hugely popular guy. He actually started publishing some newspapers."
Social Studies,"And he actually sent some military generals to put down further counter revolutions on the part of the Royalists. So he became even more and more popular. And the Directory was a little bit afraid of him at this point. So they said, hey why don't you go do whatever you want. And that's when Napoleon left from Toulon and he went to Egypt. He went to Egypt with his visions of grandeur, where he did all of the damage down there. And killed and won multiple wars against the Ottomans in both Egypt and Syria."
Social Studies,"But unfortunately for him, his good friend Horatio Nelson destroyed his whole fleet in the Battle of the Nile. Horatio-- let me draw that in a darker color. So that is Horatio Nelson destroyed his entire fleet there. So they were stranded. In 1799, Napoleon was essentially able to abandon all of his troops and then come back to France on his own. So this is in 1799, Napoleon makes his way back to France."
Social Studies,"And then we saw in the last video, he takes power with two of the directors as the three consuls of France. But in short order, he is able to declare himself as First Consul in 1799. This is hard to read. And is essentially the dictator, or the authoritarian ruler, of France. But all of while this was happening, remember, this was all during this war of the Second Coalition. In 1798, he wasn't much help in that war, he was out in Egypt doing all of these silly things."
Social Studies,"They were at war with Britain, that's why Horatio Nelson went and destroyed his fleet. But even after he takes power at the end of 1799 or early 1800, they're still at war. So Napoleon, he decides to take charge. So he leads the troops across the Alps into Italy. And once again, this pattern is emerging. And this one actually wasn't very clear in the beginning that it was going to go his way. The Italian campaign, it started very badly."
Social Studies,"But eventually, he was able to win against, once again, the Austrians at the Battle of Marengo and Hohenlinden. I know I'm probably not saying all of these well. But once again, through Napoleon directly leading the troops, he was able to end the war of the Second Coalition. And then the United Kingdom, or Great Britain, however you want to call it-- many times when people use the word Great Britain it's referring to the entire United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland."
Social Studies,"If you wanted to be formal, Great Britain refers just to the island of Great Britain that has England and Scotland and Wales on it, while this is Ireland. But I don't feel like keep repeatedly saying United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which was now united in the early 1800s. I'll just keep saying Great Britain. But there was just fatigue. So the war essentially ended with Great Britain as well. This is, as we said before, this was the Treaty of Amiens. But very, very, very, short-lived peace."
Social Studies,"Because in 1803, with Napoleon still in power, the Third Coalition formed. And in the next video, we're going to see exactly how Napoleon was able to once again be victorious over these powers to become essentially, in his mind, invincible.."
Social Studies,"So he takes power. He becomes First-- let me put that in capital letters-- First Consul. Then in 1802, actually before I get to 1802. Let me say what he did in 1800. Remember when he took power, we were still in the war of the Second Coalition. We talked about that a little bit. France had lost ground, they had lost a lot of what they had gained in the First Coalition in Italy. The Austrians had taken it back. So Napoleon decides to take charge, cross the Alps."
Social Studies,"This is a picture of Napoleon crossing the Alps. Leading the troops into the Alps to take back what he felt needed to be taken back from Austria. And then we learned in the last video that that essentially is what ended the First Coalition. So in 1800 he takes back or leaves to take back Italy. And when we talk about Italy, we're really talking about the Kingdom of Italy, which was northern Italy. We're not talking about the Kingdom of Naples, which was southern Italy. Or the Papal States."
Social Studies,"Actually let me show you that. If we go all the way down here. You'll see when people talk about the Kingdom of Italy in this period of time, they're really talking about this region up here, which is really northern Italy. The Papal States are right here. And you had your Kingdom of Naples down there. Compared to modern Europe, the two countries that we associate with Europe today that really didn't exist in a unified form in the early 1800s were Italy and Germany."
Social Studies,"They were really just broken up into a bunch of kingdoms. And as I mentioned before, Germany at this point, that confederation of kingdoms was kind of referred to as the Holy Roman Empire where the King of Austria had the title of Holy Roman Emperor. But he didn't control the Holy Roman Empire in a very centralized fashion. It was actually controlled by a bunch of smaller kings. But anyway, let's go back to Napoleon. So that's him crossing the Alps in 1800. That ends when he takes it back."
Social Studies,"He defeats Austria. That is essentially the end of the Second Coalition. We learned that in the last video. You had your Treaty of Luneville. End of Second Coalition. They don't have a treaty with Great Britain until the next year, really just out of attrition. But that doesn't matter, it was a very short-lived treaty. And then in 1802, before we start talking about the Third Coalition, Napoleon gets the Constitution of the Year X passed."
Social Studies,"And why do you say year 10? Remember, they had this whole revolutionary calendar going. So in the revolutionary calendar this was the 10th year of the Revolution. But what's really relevant from Napoleon's point of view is article one. It says, the French people name and the senate proclaims Napoleon Bonaparte First Consul for life. So, if you want to view this is kind of legally giving Napoleon almost a king-like status, it writes it in words that he will rule France for the rest of his life."
Social Studies,"Then we get to 1803. And actually, before I get to 1803, remember what's happening at the same time here. You had your Revolution in Haiti, which, if you remember from those videos, Haiti was the most profitable slave colony in the world. Once the slaves revolted, got their freedom, all of a sudden not as profitable to France as it was before. And remember, the whole French Revolution started off because France was broke. So Napoleon tries to reinstate slavery. That essentially backfires on him."
Social Studies,"Dessalines catches wind of it, him and the other revolutionaries. So they essentially start antagonizing Leclerc even more. Leclerc and the French occupiers get ravaged by yellow fever. And Dessalines is a very aggressive general. So he starts losing Haiti. You have Rochambeau, if you remember from those videos, he's this hugely brutal figure who takes over after Leclerc. But we have this revolution in Haiti. And you can kind of say they're starting to lose Haiti."
Social Studies,"And at the same time, and this is 1802, and as we're entering into 1803, Napoleon begins to realize that Great Britain controls the seas. Great Britain dominant navy. And because they're losing Haiti, which is really their main profit center, and Great Britain is dominant, Napoleon essentially gives up on North America."
Social Studies,"So outside of Haiti, which was this major profit center for the French Empire, they also had the territory of Louisiana, which is essentially the middle 1/3 of what we now consider to be the United States. And Napoleon figures out, gee, Great Britain has a dominant navy. I'm giving up on Haiti. I'm probably going to lose it anyway to Dessalines. Let me just give up on the entire continent."
Social Studies,"If I don't sell Louisiana, either Great Britain or the United States will probably be in a good position to take it from me. So he decides to sell Louisiana. So just as someone, or as an American, and especially an American who was born in Louisiana, it's fascinating the chain of events that led up to this. Because when you learn it from an American history point of view, you just say hey Thomas Jefferson, he was able to get Louisiana for $15 million."
Social Studies,"Why would someone sell, all of a sudden, this huge amount of territory? And the reason is because Napoleon figured he was going to lose it no matter what. Great Britain had this dominant navy. And at the same time, he had nothing else to protect in the area. The other major valuable asset there was Haiti. So a combination of Great Britain having this navy and of the slave revolt in Haiti ends up within the United States being able to acquire what's now the middle 1/3 of the continent."
Social Studies,"You can kind of wonder, if they never did that, would they have ever a gone on to capture the entire west coast? So these small little things in history. And I wouldn't necessarily call these little things, but they lead to very tremendous changes in our modern world. Anyway, enough about that. So he sells Louisiana. Great Britain has a dominant navy. At first, Napoleon was amassing troops up here, he was thinking about an invasion of Great Britain."
Social Studies,"But more and more it dawns on him that Great Britain has a dominant navy. Great Britain, I think, starts to feel a little self-confident. And they don't like all of the gains that Napoleon has gotten in the last two wars. So, Great Britain declares war in 1803, in May 1803. Or I could say United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the same thing. declares war. And you could view this as the beginning of the war of the Third Coalition. But it's not a coalition yet. It's just the United Kingdom."
Social Studies,"Or it's just Great Britain. And it really gets heated in 1805. Everyone else jumps in. And now we're talking about a real coalition. Now Great Britain is joined by Austria and Russia. And Austria, all the time in every one of these coalitions, they lose territory to France and especially Napoleon. They just want to get revenge. United Kingdom kind of senses that they control the water, they want to get revenge. Russia doesn't like this upstart Napoleon. And so they all jump in."
Social Studies,"And so there's two interesting angles of the War of the Third Coalition. Let me write this right here. This is the Third Coalition. And there were other people who jumped in, but these were the major powers. So this right here is the Third Coalition. So the first thing that happens, or really the two almost happen simultaneously. In October of 1805, the French navy gets destroyed by the British in the Battle of Trafalgar. This is Trafalgar, it's actually written here."
Social Studies,"And they get destroyed by Napoleon's good old friend, Admiral Horatio Nelson. So this guy was definitely a thorn in Napoleon's side. He destroyed Napoleon's ships in the Battle of the Nile that stranded their troops in Egypt. And now he comes and essentially destroys the French navy at the Battle of Trafalgar. And this is an image of it."
Social Studies,"And I guess the only redeeming fact of this battle for Napoleon was that near the end of the battle, Horatio Nelson actually gets stricken by a bullet and he dies at Trafalgar. So the Royal Navy, the British navy was already dominant, destroying the French navy, which was the only navy that could in some way compete on any level. Destroying them at Trafalgar really established British domination of the seas. This is actually an image of the Battle of Trafalgar. This is the battle right there."
Social Studies,"A bunch of ships just shooting at each other, you can't really make out what's happening. And just to connect that to modern day Great Britain, or the modern day London, this right here is an image of Trafalgar Square. It is named after the Battle of Trafalgar, which established Britain is dominant in the seas. That is Trafalgar Square in London. And if you go there, you will see Nelson's column. This is Nelson's column right there, named after Horatio Nelson."
Social Studies,"And at the very top of it, there's a little figure, or it's probably pretty large, but little relative to the column, of Horatio Nelson himself. So that was a bit of an aside, but this occurred during the war of the Third Coalition. So Napoleon's navy is destroyed. But he doesn't give up. He's just like, OK, oh well, I can't do much beyond Europe, but in Europe I can still do a lot of damage. So what he does is he takes his troops. He had given up on actually attacking Britain by sea."
Social Studies,"He realized that he could never realistically do that. Let me show you the troop movements that were going on at this time. So he had troops here that he had given up on actually attacking Great Britain. And what he does is he meets the Austrians. So the Austrians are amassing their troops here. They actually thought that there was a possibility that the main campaign would go in Italy. So they actually focused most of their troops there, that we'll see as a major mistake."
Social Studies,"But they have troops in what is now southern Germany near the Black Forest. And then they also amassed some troops near Italy. And then the Russians were coming up behind. They weren't able to meet. And we're dealing with the fall, this is now September, October of 1805. And the Russians were back here trying to bring their troops to assist the Austrians in meeting Napoleon. And all of these, it's always unclear on how much of it was tactical genius versus pure luck."
Social Studies,"Because they didn't have satellites, they didn't know where the other troops were. They didn't necessarily know exactly what's happening on a minute-by-minute basis, like armies do today. But what happened, and it's one of the pivotal battles in European history, is that Napoleon meets the Austrians at Ulm. Let me draw it on this map right here. So on this map they just do a very general-- This is Napoleon meeting the Austrians right here at Ulm. There's actually a whole campaign of Ulm, several battles."
Social Studies,"But it was a decisive victory at Ulm. And the crux of that victory was that Napoleon was able to fool the Austrians. So this is a zoomed-in version of what was going on here. This is France. This is the Black Forest. This is Austria right there. Blue is Napoleon troops, red are the Austrian troops. And you saw, Austria had amassed most of their troops on the Italian front. So here in Black Forest, you have your Austrian troops."
Social Studies,"What Napoleon did is he had General Marat make it look like the main force of the French were coming straight from the West. And they did that by having cavalry essentially giving the appearance of a major force coming in from here. So the Austrians were thinking, OK, this is the direction that we're going to face our main antagonism from."
Social Studies,"But at the same time, the bulk of the Napoleon's army-- remember he doesn't see exactly how many people are here, they just made it look like this is the bulk of the army. But the bulk of the army actually did what they call a wheeling manoeuvre, where they went around the Austrian army. And they were able to do it much faster and in a much more nimble way than anyone would have predicted. Because they essentially didn't have to carry as many supplies. They were doing this during the harvest season."
Social Studies,"And this was by design. If you capture enemy territory during the harvest season, and these are things that you usually don't think about when you learn about military battles. But you've got troops, you've got to feed the troops. If they can't capture food from the land, then you've got to carry supplies with you. And supplies are heavy it slows down your army. But if you do the attack during the harvest season, you don't have to carry food. You can just take it from the farmers that you pass by."
Social Studies,"They're harvesting food as you pass by, you just take it, you can be fast and nimble. And he essentially went around the army and was able to attack the Austrians from this direction. And then essentially destroy them. And this is why I hinted in the last video that Napoleon starts to view himself as invincible. And this was before the Russians could come to actually reinforce the Austrians. So they did it-- by being able to do it so quickly, they were able to just only tackle the Austrians."
Social Studies,"So it was a decisive victory at Ulm. Let me go to the painting right there. This is a painting of the surrender at Ulm. And then the combined Russian and Austrian forces, they essentially regrouped, but they re-met Napoleon's forces after Ulm. In another several weeks, at Austerlitz. And once again, Napoleon just routed them. And there's always a debate. Some of it might have been tactical genius, some of it might have been pure luck."
Social Studies,"But after routing them at Austerlitz-- so this is Austerlitz-- and taking so much I guess both in terms of casualties and prisoners from the enemy without incurring so much themselves, this really was the high point in terms of a battle for Napoleon. Austerlitz is what really convinced Napoleon that he is truly, truly a military genius. And that's not saying that he's not. But it was such a rout that he started to imagine that he's on some level invincible."
Social Studies,"And so the outcome, this essentially ends the war of the Third Coalition. And with that ending, Austria had to give its territory that it had gotten in Italy. So Austria had to cede the territory that it had in Italy, some of the territory that it had in Bavaria. And from, I guess just a general point of view, this was historically significant. Because until this point in time, this whole area was called the Holy Roman Empire, with the King of Austria calling himself the Holy Roman Emperor."
Social Studies,"Even though he didn't have direct control over all of these Germanic regions. Let me go back up here. This is in 1805, or we can even say we're entering 1806, but in late 1805, with the end of the Third Coalition, now the Austrian King no longer calls himself the Holy Roman Emperor. He gives up the title. And this region right here is no longer called the Holy Roman Empire. It is called the Confederation of the Rhine. And it's essentially under the protection of Napoleon."
Social Studies,"And this is the first time-- we're starting to get to a point, Germany won't be unified for another 60 or 70 years. But we're starting to get to the point that the German nation is escaping from the bounds of being the Holy Roman Empire. And so it's getting in that direction. So the Holy Roman Empire is gone. France gets significant territory from Austria, once again. Russia on some level is just humbled a little bit. And then we end in 1806, or at the end of 1805, with France dominant."
Social Studies,"And while all of that was happening, it was really in 1804 when France was only at war with Great Britain. The whole alliance hadn't formed yet. It 1804, in December-- and this is relevant that it's a peek into his ego. So this is the year before Austerlitz. In 1804, Napoleon declares himself, or he crowns himself Emperor. And this is a picture of him as Emperor. And after this point, instead of being called Napoleon Bonaparte, he is called Napoleon I."
Social Studies,"And the idea of crowning yourself Emperor, you might say, what's the point? You already were Consul for life, you have power for your whole life. But other than you get this neat title emperor, which probably feeds your ego quite well, but beyond that, this essentially establishes a dynasty. It now says, I'm not just a First Consul, I am the emperor. I'm Napoleon I. And it implies that his descendants will continue to reign over the French Empire."
Social Studies,"So on some level, he kind of destroys the notion of a republic. So we're ending the Third Coalition with France is dominant in Europe. It has gotten all of this territory mainly from Austria. The Holy Roman Empire no longer exists. It's now the Confederation of the Rhine. Napoleon, after Austerlitz, thinks that he is invincible. And he also is now Emperor. So all of his visions of grandeur are coming true.."
Social Studies,"And we saw that at the end of 1805, after the Battle of Austerlitz, Napoleon was able to crush the Third Coalition, which was mainly made up of Russia and Austria. And this is all review. We saw this in the last video. And the big by-product of that, other than the fact that it just made everyone think gee, this Napoleon guy, he's pretty formidable, is that it ended the Holy Roman Empire. Which you remember was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire."
Social Studies,"It was really just a collection of German speaking states. But it ended the official Holy Roman Empire. And Napoleon felt so good about himself at this point, especially after crushing the Austrian and Russian forces at Austerlitz, that he had the Arc de Triomphe, which if you go to Paris right now, it's one of the things you should see. He had this built. And now it's to commemorate all of the soldiers who have died for France."
Social Studies,"But it was originally built by Napoleon, or it was commissioned by Napoleon, to celebrate his victory at Austerlitz. So this is the Arc de Triomphe. My spelling is always a little weak. But it's especially weak when I'm spelling something in French. And that's right there. So Napoleon was doing pretty well. Now, on the other side of the equation, you could imagine that the other major powers of Europe were kind of licking their wounds."
Social Studies,"They weren't sure what was going on and they were starting to feel threatened. And in particular, this guy started to feel especially threatened. This is Frederick-- once again my spelling is not the strongest, especially when I'm doing something in German-- Frederick Wilhelm III. It actually took me a long time to realize that Wilhelm and William are the same names. And William is just the English version of it. But this is Frederick Wilhelm III and he is the King of Prussia."
Social Studies,"And he stayed out of the action during the Third Coalition. And even now, Prussia is a major European power. And he gets threatened by this rising power of Napoleon, who was able to break up, or almost take away Austria's influence from the Holy Roman Empire. And now it kind of becomes this Confederation of the Rhine. Let me show you the map. So this whole area over here."
Social Studies,"All of this right over here, which is now mainly modern day Germany, that used to be the Holy Roman Empire, it's emperor was the King of Austria, who wasn't necessarily in it, but it kind of implies some type of allegiance. This is France right here. Once he was able to trounce Austria in Austerlitz-- Austria and Russia-- then this becomes the Confederation of the Rhine. Let me highlight this a little bit better. So this general area. Holy Roman Empire no longer exists."
Social Studies,"And it now becomes kind of a satellite region of France. France has a huge amount of control. So you could imagine that the King of Prussia starts getting a little bit threatened. France is on its borders, it has shown itself to be able to defeat other great powers with ease. So this guy gets a little paranoid whether he feels that France might kind of threaten Prussia's power."
Social Studies,"Or maybe on the other side of the equation, that he just didn't like this upstart who was not related to all of the other royalty of Europe. He maybe wanted to put him in his place. So Frederick Wilhelm III declares war. We're now in 1806. We have Prussia declares war on France. And you're going to see this pattern multiple times. And the one thing to kind of remember, if you just want to remember kind of major themes."
Social Studies,"We're always talking about the First Coalition, Second Coalition, Third Coalition, Fourth Coalition, all of these. And it's always some combination of Britain. And Britain has kind of already dominated the ocean. So when we talk about these battles on land, we're not talking about Britain much. But this whole time, Britain is in the background trying to be a pain in France's neck. And then all the other coalitions are some combination of Prussia, Austria, and Russia."
Social Studies,"And some other countries here and there. But you see one after another that they keep challenging Napoleon up to this point. And Napoleon keeps trouncing them, takes more and more land and territory and power from them. And they get even more insecure and then they want to form other coalitions. So this happens again. And this is the start of the Fourth Coalition. In the last video, it was the third. This is now the formation of the fourth."
Social Studies,"And essentially, the coalition forms as soon as someone else other than Great Britain joins the fight. Because Great Britain is kind of in a continuous war with Napoleon over this entire time period. So we've got this Fourth Coalition that forms. We've got Prussia, we've got Great Britain, and Russia wants to join the fight again. So as you can imagine, the end of the Third Coalition didn't keep Russia out of the fight for long. Let me write it down. You have Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain."
Social Studies,"There's always some other actors, but these are the major ones. And it was kind of silly on the part of Prussia. Because Prussia would've been in a much better situation if it had helped the Third Coalition. Maybe that would have changed the outcome. But now they're kind of taking on Napoleon, at least initially on their own. Because Russia is always kind of behind Austria or Prussia, depending which coalition you're talking about. So Prussia and Austria are always the first line of offense."
Social Studies,"In this case, in the Fourth Coalition, it's Prussia. And they get trounced in Jena-Auerstedt. Let me show you where that is. So this is actually Napoleon getting the troops together at Jena-Auerstedt. This right here is a charge of the French troops there. Let me write this down. Two cities close by each other in Germany. They are roughly around here. Let's see, this map is a little difficult to read. But they're roughly in that area right there. Napoleon, once again, he trounces Prussia."
Social Studies,"So Prussia is just out of the way. That's in October of 1806. And then Napoleon essentially chases the Russians through most of what's now Poland. He has this hugely bloody stalemate at Eylau. I don't even know how to say that. It's right around there. If I read my maps correctly. So a stalemate. This is in 1807. Stalemate, February 1807 at-- let me get the spelling right, E-Y-L-A-U. Super bloody. They actually win the battle."
Social Studies,"But they aren't able to decisively defeat the Russian troops, or the Russian army. And there are estimates that in that one battle, there's anywhere from 15,000 to 25,000 casualties on both sides. Which was huge at that time. Even now, if you think about even modern wars, that's a major amount of casualties to have in just one single battle. But Napoleon persists, and he's eventually able to decisively meet the Russians at Friedland, which is right about there. That is in June of 1807."
Social Studies,"And then he's able to decisively defeat the Fourth Coalition. So here we we're kind of at the summer of 1807. We're talking about June is when Friedland occurs, Russians decisively defeated. The Prussians were already trounced several months ago. And then in July of '07, July of 1807, you have France signing the Treaties of Tilsit. And it's called the Treaties of Tilsit, instead of the Treaty of Tilsit, because he signed separate treaties with Russia and Prussia."
Social Studies,"At this point, Napoleon had kind of lost all respect for Prussia. And he wanted to show it. So he had a separate treaty with Prussia and a separate treaty with Russia. The one with Russia was a lot more respectable. It had all this language about how Napoleon and Tsar Alexander I are now friends. This is Tsar Alexander I right here. And as you'll see, this friendship is very temporary. As you could imagine, I mean this is the guy Napoleon defeated at Austerlitz not too long ago."
Social Studies,"So all this friendship should probably be written in quotes. But the treaty with Russia was very friendly. And I think Napoleon still respected Russia's power. So friendly with Russia, it declared them allies. But the other Treaty of Tilsit with Prussia carved it up. Carved up Prussia. And the main thing it did, if we look at this map here, this is a map of central Europe. Or I guess Prussia and Austria and France at the end of the Third Coalition."
Social Studies,"The main thing it did, it took the territory west of the river Elbe from Prussia. So this is the river Elbe right here. The blue is Prussia after the Third Coalition. So all of this stuff gets taken away from Prussia. And most of it turns into a French satellite kingdom called the Kingdom of Westphalia. So this is part of the Prussian Treaty of Tilsit. So you have the Kingdom of Westphalia. And to really emphasize, it really is a French satellite state."
Social Studies,"And to add insult to injury to the Prussians, Napoleon puts his brother Jerome as king. So it really is a satellite state of France. So here at the end of this, the other powers in Europe haven't learned that this Napoleon character with his grand army, this huge army that he's been able to raise and his military tactics, really is someone formidable to deal with. So they keep, Third Coalition, and then they lose territory. Then the Fourth Coalition, then they lose even more territory."
Social Studies,"So what happens at the end of this Fourth Coalition, and actually during the Fourth Coalition, after Napoleon defeated Prussia, he realized gee, you know what? I have, I'm in either direct control or indirect control of a significant part of Europe. And at the same time, he knew that Britain had complete domination of the oceans. And it was this kind of rising industrial power. It was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. So Napoleon's ideas, well I can't defeat Great Britain on the waters."
Social Studies,"Did I say Russia? No I've been saying-- the whole point is that Great Britain is dominant on the oceans. And Napoleon realizes that he can't invade Great Britain by sea. He can't do anything in the water with Great Britain kind of pestering him. So what he tries to do is declare economic warfare on Great Britain. And he institutes at the end of 1806, the Continental System. So I'll put this right here. This is in November of 1806. So this is right after he trounces the Prussians at Jena-Auerstedt."
Social Studies,"This is in November of 1806, where he's feeling really good about his strength on the actual continent. He institutes what he calls the Continental System. And this is really just the notion of economic warfare with Great Britain. That hey, if you are either a part of the French Empire, controlled by the French Empire, or aligned with the French Empire, you embargo Great Britain. This little island, it controls the waters, but it is dependant on trade."
Social Studies,"So Napoleon's idea through this Continental System is to embargo the United Kingdom of Great Britain, whatever we want to call it. Embargo Great Britain. And one thing he got out of the Russians, this was actually a huge concession, because Russia was a major power at the time. He got them, through the Treaty of Tilsit, to also join the Continental System. Let me write that in a color that'll actually show up."
Social Studies,"And in return, he also got some land, some islands, the Ionian Islands off the western coast of Greece. And some of the land off the Dalmatian coast. Let me show you right there. So this area over here. And Russia in return, and it's pretty good because Russia essentially lost the war, but in return they were allowed to do whatever they want with the Ottoman Empire."
Social Studies,"And we'll talk more about the Ottoman Empire in future videos, but if you want to have a general view of what the Ottoman Empire is, I guess the last remnant of it is what is today modern Turkey. But obviously it was an empire at that time. But Russia and the Ottoman Empire were kind of that at odds with each other. So it was great for Russia to say hey, I'm going to be able to do whatever I want with the Ottoman Empire. Because before this, Napoleon was nominally aligned with the Ottomans."
Social Studies,"So this was actually a big concession for Russia. So at the end of this, we have a situation once again, I guess the other powers don't realize it. Over and over, Third Coalition, Napoleon, he really takes care of the Russians and the Austrians. Destroys the Holy Roman Empire, makes it the Confederation of the Rhine under Napoleon's control. Prussia wants to put down Napoleon. Declares war again, Fourth Coalition. The only by-product of that is now they lose this land. Napoleon becomes even stronger."
Social Studies,"Puts his brother as king in the kingdom of Westphalia. And now he has Russia as an ally to help his embargo on England. So really, after the end of the Fourth Coalition, a lot of historians view this as kind of the height of Napoleon's power in Europe.."
Social Studies,"And really removing it from the status of one the preeminent powers. And all I talked about was the loss of the territories of Prussia west of the Elbe. And that's about that area right there. But just as important as that, the Polish holdings of Prussia. So all of this area right over here, this also was removed from Prussia and became a French satellite state. It became the Duchy of Warsaw. So I just really want to emphasize."
Social Studies,"The Treaty of Tilsit, I only emphasized kind of what happened on the western side of Prussia, but the eastern side of Prussia also got carved up. And Prussia essentially lost half of its size. So it's very dramatic humiliation for Prussia at the end of the Treaty of Tilsit. Or the Treaties of Tilsit. Now with that out of the way, we talked about in the last video, that at the end of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon was kind of near the peak of his power. He'd kind of done everything right."
Social Studies,"He had this kind of steady upward momentum, or France had a steady upward momentum in its power. But what we're going to see in this video, at least the beginnings of the downfall of Napoleon. And it's not going to be obvious when you look at the territory. Because from a territorial point of view, you're going to see in this video that he's actually gaining territory. But he is going to start doing some of the actions that end up undermining him."
Social Studies,"So we talked about in the last video, we talked about this whole notion of the Continental System, where Napoleon was obsessed with people on the continent of Europe boycotting England, not trading with England. And he figured this is the only way that he could really undermine England's dominance on the ocean. Or eventually maybe even undermine England generally. So as we said, in the Treaties of Tilsit he got Russia to participate in the Continental System. So he wanted everyone to buy into it."
Social Studies,"And one party that, at this point, we're talking about-- we're in 1807 now-- one party that wasn't all that keen in participating in the Continental System was Portugal. That's Portugal right there. So Napoleon goes and chats-- well they didn't chat directly-- but he gets the agreement of the King of Spain. This is Charles IV, and he's going to look like a bit of a fool and this video."
Social Studies,"And Napoleon says, hey Charles, let's go in there, let's go into Portugal, that little upstart country that doesn't want to participate in the Continental System. You and me, we'll invade together. We'll bring them into kind of our realm of influence. And we can both kind of pillage the lands and get the wealth of Portugal. Charles IV, he's all up for this. So a combined French and Spanish force invade Portugal. So in 1807, this is the end of 1807, it's actually in October."
Social Studies,"In October, you have a combined French and Spanish invasion of Portugal. And they are able to take Portugal, but we're going to see that it's reasonably temporary. Now I just mentioned that this guy is going to look like the fool of this video. And the reason is, because with the excuse of reinforcements, obviously to get to Portugal, you have to go through Spain. So with the excuse of sending in reinforcements, Napoleon in 1808-- and now we're talking about early 1808, in particular in March."
Social Studies,"So with the excuse of sending in reinforcements to support the Portugal campaign, and Spain is like your my ally, sure, send those hundreds of thousands of troops right through our territory. We're not going to worry about it. And with that excuse, Napoleon was able to send 100,000 troops and occupy Madrid. So this is one of those lessons of never get too greedy. This guy got greedy, wanted to help Napoleon. Or I guess the other lesson is be careful who your friends are."
Social Studies,"This guy wanted to invade Portugal, but the side effect of it is that Madrid gets occupied. And that actually he gets dethrowned. And so you have this situation here, the French are now in control of Spain. In May of 1808-- and this is really going to be the first little spark that is kind of the downfall of Napoleon. In May 2, 1808, a popular uprising starts in Madrid. Dos de Mayo. So a popular uprising in Madrid."
Social Studies,"And at the same time, a little bit after that-- So you can imagine, this is a hugely tumultuous time. You have this occupation of Portugal with the excuse of reinforcements in March. The French troops occupy Madrid. Then in May-- so a couple of months later-- a popular uprising starts in Madrid. This leads to popular uprisings throughout Spain."
Social Studies,"But at the very same time as this-- this is a little bit after the uprising in May-- Napoleon says, oh, this is just a little uprising, I'm still in control of Spain. He appoints his other brother-- remember, there's this whole business he's putting his brothers in charge of different parts of the Empire. He puts his brother Joseph, he appoints his brother Joseph-- or you could kind of say-- he inserts his brother Joseph as the King of Spain. So this is all in kind of early, mid-1808."
Social Studies,"Spain is in all of this turmoil. A new king has been appointed, who is Napoleon's brother. The old king is no longer in charge. You have this ongoing battle in Portugal. They don't have a firm hold on Portugal just yet. And in the rest of 1808, the uprising that occurs throughout Spain is actually pretty successful in enforcing the French troops to retreat. And a major, I guess, aspect of this uprising is it's one of the first real national uprisings in history."
Social Studies,"It's people saying we are Spanish, we do not like being controlled by the French. We do not like how they have treated our royalty. We as a nation are going to rise up. And the other interesting aspect of this whole uprising that starts in Madrid with Dos de Mayo, but then it starts continuing throughout the whole nation, is the idea of guerrilla warfare. Not gorilla warfare. And this comes from the Spanish for little war. Not from the large ape."
Social Studies,"And what it implies, you probably heard the word on the news before, is kind of a non-conventional style of fighting, where small little groups kind of engage their enemy in very nontraditional styles. So it becomes a very painful-- at least for it Napoleon's forces-- it became very difficult fighting these non-conventional battles all over Spain. So they were able to force the French to retreat. Napoleon says, gee, you know what? If you want a job well done, you've got to do it yourself."
Social Studies,"So Napoleon comes in at the end of the year, and then he retakes Madrid. So December of 1808, Napoleon back in Madrid. Now, you might say all is fine and well. Now Napoleon is back here. He has firm control of Spain. But not everything is good. Because as you could imagine, there's all these other characters here that keep forming coalitions for and against Napoleon."
Social Studies,"Even when they say that they're allied, you know that in the back of their minds they can't wait until they can declare the next war on Napoleon. So in 1809-- let me write this down-- Austria declares war. And since Great Britain was in-- at this point in time-- perpetual war with France, this becomes the Fifth Coalition. But this one is fairly short-lived. Napoleon says gee, I got these guys on my eastern front. Austria is re-declaring war on me. So he leaves Spain to go lead that fight."
Social Studies,"And he leaves 300,000 of his best troops in Spain to hold Spain. And frankly, this is the most important side effect of the Fifth Coalition, is that it makes Napoleon go to fight Austria, to lead that effort, as opposed to worrying about Spain. And essentially by doing that-- and I don't know if it's necessarily the fact that Napoleon wasn't there. But it could be because Napoleon wasn't there-- is that Spain just becomes a major thorn in Napoleon's side."
Social Studies,"This guerrilla warfare just continues on and on and on. And it just goes back and forth. And the French will win a battle and they'll win another battle. But they still don't have control. And these guerrillas will kind of peck at them and continue the uprising. And this really just drains the French army. And really just gets at them little bit by little bit, really over the remainder of Napoleon's reign. So all the way until 1814. We haven't gone over that yet. But this occurs all the way to 1814."
Social Studies,"So I said at the beginning the video, this is one of the starting points of Napoleon's downfall. That's just because he was just stuck in Spain from 1808 on, just continuing to have to send troops and supplies and reinforcements and wealth to support what they called the Peninsular Campaign. And it just drains him. It drains his resources, it drains his energy. And it really hurts his ability to fight wars with all of the other people who he needs to fight wars with. This is one of the major downfalls."
Social Studies,"The other one, which we'll probably talk about in the next video or video after that, is his invasion of Russia. Which he does in 1812. One could debate which one drains France's resources more. But the invasion of Russia really decimates Napoleon's forces. And really makes him susceptible to really conquest by England and all of the other allies. And we're going to see that in a couple of videos. So you have this been Peninsular Campaign continuing to drain Napoleon."
Social Studies,"It all started because he wanted to enforce the Continental System on Portugal. And he got a little bit greedy. And he also wanted to conquer Spain. And just to highlight why it's called the Peninsular Campaign. This right here, a little bit of geography, this is called the Iberian Peninsula right there that I'm circling. So you could call it the Iberian Peninsular Campaign, because it's everything that's going on in this Peninsula in Spain and Portugal."
Social Studies,"Now if we back up a little bit back to 1808, where we had this uprising in Spain, and they were able to push the French back. At the same time, you also had a popular uprising in Portugal roughly in the fall, late summer or fall of 1808. The British got excited. They saw it as their chance to push Napoleon out of Portugal. So you have this gentleman right here, Sir Arthur Wellesley. He's a future Duke of Wellington. And he's eventually going to be responsible for pushing Napoleon out of Spain entirely."
Social Studies,"Or at least out of Madrid. Him and along with the British and along with the Portuguese are able to push the French out in August of 1808. So let me put this in my not so neatly drawn timeline here. So in December, Napoleon is back, so right before that in August, out of Portugal. And this is another motivation for Napoleon to say, gee, you know what? Things aren't going well on the Iberian Peninsula, I have to take charge of things myself."
Social Studies,"Now, at the very same time as all of this is happening, and this is really just kind of out of interest. Well it's more than out of interest, because actually it has huge global repercussions. You might say, OK, well you have this Iberian Peninsula. Spain is going back and forth between the French and the guerillas. And Portugal has this whole situation where their king was dethrowned, but then the British help and take it back. But you could imagine, these nations are in just a super state of flux."
Social Studies,"Now you could also imagine, the King of Spain wasn't just the King of Spain, he was King of the Spanish Empire. And the Spanish Empire, the main land mass of the Spanish Empire was in the Americas. So this right here. That was the Spanish Empire at the time. This was a 400 year old Spanish Empire. Starting with Columbus sailing the ocean blue in 1492. You had this huge Spanish Empire."
Social Studies,"And one of the really important side effects of Napoleon invading Spain and having this long protracted engagement in Spain, is it catalyzed the ability of these colonies at the time to start looking for their independence. And we're going to do whole videos on that in the future. But this really is one of the things that allowed them to get independence."
Social Studies,"Obviously, if the empire is in flux, these guys can say hey, gee, why do we have to listen to that nation anymore? We don't even know who's in charge there. At the same time, same thing in Portugal. Brazilian independence didn't come until a little bit later after this period, but Napoleon's invasion is what really sparked the beginning of a lot of turmoil in Portugal. And that eventually is one of the causes that leads to the eventual independence of Brazil. That doesn't happen for another 10 or 15 years."
Social Studies,"But you could imagine, this is where a lot of that action can be traced back. Now, another interesting point that occurred around this time. And actually, I didn't tell you what happened on the Fifth Coalition. I said Austria declared war. Obviously Britain was already at war. So it was the Fifth Coalition. Napoleon had to leave, that maybe made Spain a little bit harder to hold for France. And that's why it kind of bled France slowly. But Napoleon was able to take care of Austria."
Social Studies,"And then he was able to take a little bit more land from them. Actually Galicia, this area of Austria was given to the Duchy of Warsaw, which was a French satellite state. And then Austria once again, had to say oh Napoleon, we're your friend, we're going to do whatever you ask us to. So you can imagine at this time landwise, the empire of Napoleon seemed pretty dramatic. You could include Spain here. Although he had to spend a lot of resources to keep Spain."
Social Studies,"And then now we had Austria, at least it was in the fold. You know Prussia was not really happy about it. But this whole area here, the western half of Poland was under French control. Germany-- the Confederacy of the Rhine-- which is now Germany. And then a good bit of Italy, the Kingdom of Italy was also a French satellite state. But Napoleon, of course, he wanted everyone to participate in the Continental System. That's the only way to really strangle England."
Social Studies,"And the Papal States were not participating in the Continental System. So he sent some people over to kind of try to convince them to. And when they didn't, they occupied the Papal States. So French troops occupied the Papal States. And then once again, this was still back in 1808. This is actually early 1808, it's just on a different front. So in February, up here, in 1808. Actually, that's before they even occupied Madrid. So in 1808, February, French troops occupy Papal States."
Social Studies,"They essentially give them over to the Kingdom of Italy, which at that time was a French satellite state. So it's almost like annexing it to France. And then once the Fifth Coalition was done with, Napoleon felt so good about himself, that he formally annexed the Papal States. Now we're in 1809. In 1809, he formally-- The Papal States are actually annexed into the French Empire. Now you can imagine that the Pope wasn't that happy about this. This is the Pope at the time, this is Pius VII."
Social Studies,"He wasn't so happy about it. So he excommunicates Napoleon. And I'll do a whole video on excommunication. But it's really about as bad as something you could do to someone within the powers of the Catholic Church. And by implication, you're no longer part of the church, and you'll probably go to hell now, at least if the Pope has anything to do with it. So Napoleon wasn't happy about this. He sent some people, some officers, once again to talk to the Pope about it."
Social Studies,"To say hey, gee, why do you want to excommunicate Napoleon? Why don't you just play nice? Why don't you just agree to whatever Napoleon says? The Pope doesn't agree, and so he gets abducted. This is why it's interesting. Napoleon, he's not afraid to take some serious action. So he gets abducted in 1809 by French officers. And it's not clear, it's not obvious that Napoleon told them to do it."
Social Studies,"But once he was abducted, and they actually started shuttling him all around France depending on who needed to talk to him. Or if they were afraid that the British might try to free him from one port, they would send them some place else. But it wasn't clear that Napoleon ordered this. But he never ordered his release. So in some ways, you got to say that it was sanctioned by Napoleon. So all of this mess starts, you know, Napoleon is messing with the Pope. He has this ongoing bleeding going on in Spain."
Social Studies,"And that ends actually in 1812 where Sir Arthur Wellesley finally retakes Madrid. But during this whole period, you can imagine it's really draining into the resources of the French Empire.."
Social Studies,"And the other, almost more direct catalyst for the fall of Napoleon, was his invasion of Russia. We're going to see in this is video why it was so disastrous for Napoleon. This is easily one of the top five, I would say, famous military campaigns in all of history. So let's remind ourselves the relationship between Napoleon, or between the French Empire and Russia. After the Fourth Coalition, you might remember the Treaty of Tilsit, they're friends."
Social Studies,"Russia was part of the Continental System, which means that they would boycott or that they would not trade with Britain. Or allow Britain to use any of Russia's ports. And Russia was allowed to do anything that they want with the Ottoman Empire. So everything was good. But then we move forward to 1811. We're in 1811 and Russia starts relaxing the Continental System. Essentially meaning that they started to trade a little bit with Britain. So this all of a sudden begins to annoy, it angers Napoleon."
Social Studies,"In order for an embargo to work, in order for the Continental System to work, everyone on the continent has to not trade with Britain. Because if someone trades with Britain, Britain could just trade with them and then that trade could circulate through the rest of Europe. So in order for this to work, it has to be total. So this already annoys Napoleon. Especially because he defeated the Russians in the Fourth Coalition. In the Treaty of Tilsit he thought he was being nice to them."
Social Studies,"Just don't do any trade with Great Britain, we're going to be good buddies. But then what really got Napoleon is in 1812, he hears that Russia is thinking about taking the French Empire's part of Poland, or the Duchy of Warsaw. So Russia thinking about taking Poland. So Napoleon figures, gee, we're no longer friends, I better attack them preemptively. So against the advice of a lot of people about actually invading Russia, Napoleon decides to invade. So this directly leads to Napoleon invading."
Social Studies,"And his other option, obviously, would have been just to defend Poland from Russia. But Napoleon, he just says no, look if they're going to double cross me like that, I'm just going to go full tilt and show them who's boss. So he decides to invade in April of 1812. And Napoleon is no dummy. He realizes that the Russian winter is really vicious. So he says, if I start in the late spring like this and I engage the Russians and I decisively defeat them, everything will be said and done."
Social Studies,"And I'll be Emperor of Russia, as well. Before Russia even begins to get cold. So what I'm going to do here, to just understand how devastating this campaign ends up being to Napoleon, I'm going to use one of the most famous charts in the history of charts. Some people consider this to be the best, most well-designed chart ever. And this was created by Charles-- let me use another color. I keep using this. This was created by Charles Joseph Minard."
Social Studies,"You can actually get a bigger version of this on Wikipedia. But that was too big for my screen. So this is a smaller version. But it's a fascinating chart. So what it shows is the size of Napoleon's army as it invades Russia. And the size of the army is shown by the width of this brown line right here. So when he starts invading Russia, he has 450,000 men. If you could read this number, that's what it says. And you can find zoomed versions on the web."
Social Studies,"If you just do a search on this and on the invasion of Russia, you'll find this chart. It's very, very famous. More than even teaching you the history, this is also just a neat chart to look at. And it's something that you should be exposed to at some point. But as you can see, and just so you have some scope of what's going on, not only does it show you the size of his forces, it shows the path that it travels."
Social Studies,"And you can already see that as the forces are travelling, the number of the soldiers in the force is getting smaller and smaller. And he keeps updating the numbers. So obviously that width is smaller than that width, by it looks like it's less than half the forces at this point than at this point. And just to understand where this is going on, here is a map of Eastern Europe. And Charles Joseph Minard's map starts right around here in Lithuania."
Social Studies,"So this is where the Napoleon forces were strongest, where he had 450,000. And it kind of goes like this. This is Moscow right here. So this is kind of the endpoint. And if I were to trace this shape onto here, it would look something like this. I'm just trying to show the path. Roughly like this. And then you get to Moscow. So that line is the same thing as that line. Just so you have some context within the broader geography of Europe."
Social Studies,"So it's starting off, in what's almost exactly the northeastern border of present-day Poland, or you could say the southwestern border of what's now Lithuania. Crosses through what is now Belarus. And then goes on into Russia. Now, as you can see here, I already pointed out, that as he's traveling, as the forces are travelling, these 450,000 men, horses, and armaments, and cannons, and everything else is getting thinner and thinner. And one is, it's just basic military logistics."
Social Studies,"You have to keep your supply routes open. You have to keep leaving men behind to essentially guard the supply routes. So just as the longer your campaign, and the further into enemy territory you have, you have to keep leaving men behind to guard it. And this whole time, Napoleon kept wanting to engage with the Russians. The whole time that he was travelling, he kept expecting to engage the Russians. But just as he was about to engage the Russians, the Russians would back up a little bit."
Social Studies,"And this kept happening. They're were small skirmishes, so obviously he lost some troops here or there. But most of this was just to maintain the supply line. Eventually, he is able to have, I guess we could say, a skirmish, I don't want to say a skirmish, it was actually maybe a brief battle with the Russians in August in Smolensk. And that is, let me make sure I get it right on the map, right there. But once again, Napoleon was victorious."
Social Studies,"But the Russians retreated, it wasn't a decisive victory over the Russian army. Eventually, he just keeps chasing them, keeps chasing them, until we get to September 7, 1812. And now you could imagine that we're kind of in the fall now. And it gets cold quickly out here in Russia. So already, it's getting to be a kind of precarious position. But Napoleon is confident. He's like, you know what? If I can decisively defeat the Russians, I can take Moscow. Moscow will have food it in."
Social Studies,"And all will be said and done. And that's actually brings up another point. You might remember when I talked about the War of the Third Coalition, that Napoleon, and in general good military tactics to invade during the fall. Because of fall is the harvest season. That way you don't have to have as many supplies carried with you. You don't have to guard the supply routes as carefully. Because you can just go and take all of the farmer's crops to feed your troops."
Social Studies,"But what the Russians did is what they call scorched earth tactics, which essentially means exactly what it sounds like. As the Russians kept retreating back, they burned everything that could be of benefit to Napoleon's troops. So they burned all the fields as they retreated, so that Napoleon's troops couldn't access the local resources. So they had to keep having a very-- I guess you could say-- costly supply chain from where they started, as opposed to just feeding off of the land."
Social Studies,"And the Russians just continued to do this on and on and on. All the way to Moscow. All the way to September 1812, where we have the Battle of Borodino, if I'm saying it correctly. And at this point, Napoleon only had a 135,000 of his original 450,000 men. The rest had to be left behind to guard the supply route. Or they deserted because they were starting to get hungry. Or they were lost just with minor skirmishes that happened along the entire way."
Social Studies,"And at the Battle of Borodino, after a long, protracted, super bloody battle, in which-- let me write these numbers down-- 44-- and these are all estimates-- 44,000 Russian casualties. Mostly death, but also wounded or captured. And 35,000 French. Many historians think this is the most of bloody day of battle up to this day in history. The French are victorious. So we have a French victory here. So Napoleon is feeling good about himself. Borodino is right outside of Moscow."
Social Studies,"He's like, you know what? I'm just going to walk into Moscow. They're going to hand the keys of the city over to me. And then my troops are going to have a good time in Moscow being able to eat all the food that must be there. And I will now be Emperor of Russia, as well. So about a week later, he walks into Moscow and it's completely deserted. All of the inhabitants have left and they've taken all the food with them. And then on top of that, Moscow starts burning."
Social Studies,"And there's some debate as to why Moscow burned. Some historians believe it is because the Russians deliberately set fire to the city. Some believe that it was just a tinder box waiting to burn and Napoleon's troops were just a little irresponsible with where they built fires. It's not clear. But needless to say, it made Moscow useless to Napoleon. And this is kind of a major change. Napoleon just expected look, if I beat your army decisively, like I did it at Borodino, I won. I take the city."
Social Studies,"Now, you should give me food and shelter. And I'm your new Emperor. But the Russians had something different in mind. They said, no you will never take Russia. You can have Moscow. You can have a burned Moscow. There's nothing in it. And we'll just like to see you retreat in the Moscow winter. And by Napoleon's own accounts, this is a quote that he gave. The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory. This is at Borodino."
Social Studies,"But the Russians show themselves worthy of being invincible. So with no one to recognize Napoleon or to help him out or to feed his troops, he's kind of in a worthless Moscow. He decides to just turn around, especially because the Russian winter is approaching. So on this chart you can see they went all the way to Moscow, they had 135,000 troops. They lose 35,000 of them. So you have 100,000 troops coming back. This black line, right here, this represents the retreat. And then things start getting cold."
Social Studies,"So it's really interesting about this chart that Minard made. It has a couple things. You see the route that Napoleon's army took as it went into Russia. Then in black, this is its retreat. It gets thinner and thinner and thinner. And you see where they went. And on top of that, he shows the temperature as they retreated. And this is on something called a Reaumur scale, but you can just multiply these numbers, if you can see them, by 1.25. So you can see that it was already, it was not that bad."
Social Studies,"But over here, we're already below freezing. We're well below freezing over here. At the coldest point, if Minard's numbers are right, and I've seen some historians contest the numbers, but it was cold nonetheless. It's negative 37 degrees as we start approaching into November and December. So Napoleon's forces, as before, they had this whole supply chain. They had scorched earth. So there's nothing to eat. They still had nothing to eat. Then it started getting cold."
Social Studies,"And while it was cold and they were retreating, some of the troops would desert. They would be attacked by peasants. Just little bit by little bit they'd be attacked by various Russian forces. And then kind of the final blow was when they were trying to cross the Berezina River. So this right here is the Berezina River. And you can even see from Minard's chart that the width was respectable. But then after trying to cross that river, it just got decimated. Almost half of the soldiers died or disappeared."
Social Studies,"And these are depictions, these are paintings, of the retreat of Napoleon's forces in the winter. This is actually a painting of the crossing of Berezina. And by the time that the forces got back at the end of 1812-- all the way over here, by Minard's map-- you only have 10,000 troops of the original 450,000. So only 1 in 45 returned. The other were either captured, deserted, or just died."
Social Studies,"So when this happened, you could imagine, not only did Napoleon lose so many soldiers, also lost on the order of 200,000 horses. Actually, total casualties for this one campaign, the estimates are about 300,000 French troops. The estimates I saw had about 200,000 Russian troops. And just to be clear, a big portion of the French troops died as they tried to retreat. And then there was a huge amount of Russian civilian casualties."
Social Studies,"And there were also soldiers from other countries participating, especially on the French side. When all is said and done, estimates are over 1 million dead from the French invasion. But beyond even just the human casualties, Napoleon lost on the order of 200,000 horses. I forgot the exact number, but thousands of canons. So you could imagine, that it was just this huge, huge loss to the French military."
Social Studies,"So by the time this was done, the rest of the powers of Europe could kind of finally see Napoleon being weakened. He was already bogged down in the peninsula. He had this huge defeat as he tried to invade Russia. They finally realized that now is the time that they can form maybe a Sixth Coalition and really take Napoleon out.."
Social Studies,"I just want to take a little aside here. These numbers aren't firm. Historians aren't even sure on the exact numbers. And sometimes you'll see accounts of 500,000 to 600,000 entering and 30,000 to 40,000 leaving. I went with these numbers just because on Minard's map, these were pretty close to those numbers. Right here he has 422,000. Leaving he has 10,000 right there. But I just want to make sure you realize that these aren't exact numbers."
Social Studies,"And depending on, I guess, how you account for his troops, whether you're talking about troops directly under Napoleon's command, whether they are troops that are directly involved in the offensive invasion of Russia. Or they're just troops that are maybe supporting it. You're going to get different numbers. And depending on whether you view troops and how you count the casualties. So it's all about how you count. But needless to say, the French grand army was decimated after invading Russia."
Social Studies,"And I even told you, at the end of the last video, that after that, the rest of Europe, these other countries that kept forming and reforming coalitions against Napoleon, began to smell blood. So you can already view the invasion of Russia as the beginning of the Sixth Coalition. You already had Great Britain. Great Britain throughout this entire time period, throughout the Napoleonic Wars, and even during the French Revolution, was in a constant state of war with the French and Napoleon."
Social Studies,"Obviously, you have Russia now is also a belligerent, is also an antagonist against Napoleon. Just because he retreated doesn't mean the war with Russia is over. Prussia had been humiliated multiple times by Napoleon. And now they jump on the bandwagon after hearing about Napoleon getting decimated. And so they, a combined Russian and Prussian forces, engage Napoleon."
Social Studies,"But as much as Napoleon's forces seem to have gotten decimated-- So if you look at that Minard map up here that we went over in some detail in the last video, that covers right here. The invasion of Russia started right about here, and it went right about in that direction right there. So Napoleon, he's now retreating back. You might say, gee, he only has 10,000 or 20,000 or 30,000 troops. That's nothing. He's just going to be put out very quickly by the combined allied forces."
Social Studies,"But Napoleon, as we kind of say, regardless of what you think of him as a person, he was no dummy. And he was good at raising forces. And he was a very, very, very good military tactition. He was very quickly able to raise, to take his 30,000 soldier army, get it to 130,000. And eventually he's able to get it to 400,000. Although this force right here, it's not going to be the same quality of 400,000 as the 400,000 that he might have had, say, entering the Russian campaign."
Social Studies,"And there were other troops also that were allied with Napoleon. German troops from the Confederacy of the Rhine that were sympathetic to the French Empire. But once again, they weren't as disciplined or under as direct control of Napoleon. But, it's needless to say, he was able to very quickly get up to some reasonable force that could maybe withstand a Sixth Coalition. But the Sixth Coalition was much larger."
Social Studies,"It's on the order of, depending on the account you look at, they amassed forces mainly in what's now Germany-- but at that time, the Confederation of the Rhine. And before that, the Holy Roman Empire-- of on the order of 1 million troops. Not $1 million. One million soldiers. So even though Napoleon was able to raise a force, he was still out numbered in what's now Germany, or the Germanic kingdoms. He was still out numbered by a factor of 2:1."
Social Studies,"But despite that, the first several engagements with the combined Russian and Prussian army, Napoleon was victorious. Or I shouldn't say victorious, because that implies too much. He won those battles. And these are at Lutzen, at Bautzen. And then at Dresden, he had a very significant victory. And these are all right about here, just so you have a sense of the geography. You can actually see Dresden on the map there."
Social Studies,"And after these defeats, the Coalition said gee, this Napoleon character, even though we outnumber him, even though he had to kind of very quickly get these troops, he's a really good military tactition. And he's still kind of kicking our butt on the battlefield. They then issued what's called the-- let me write this down--the Trachtenberg Plan. Although it's not clear that they really had to. The Trachtenberg Plan, which essentially says, try not to engage forces that Napoleon is in command of directly."
Social Studies,"Try to engage his people that Napoleon has had to delegate to. His marshalls, the other generals. So don't engage Napoleon. One day I'd like to make more detailed videos on the actual kind of-- you have to say-- the actual genius of Napoleon on the battlefield. And go battle by battle and see why people consider Napoleon to be a great military commander."
Social Studies,"But his enemies definitely appreciated the fact that, despite being outnumbered, he was very tricky and very wily, and was always able to kind of snatch victory from the defeat. So they had this plan, let's just not engage Napoleon. We have so many troops, let's just try to incur losses on the French on other commanders other than Napoleon. But needless to say, they hugely outnumbered the French. All of the fighting was going on in this general area at the time."
Social Studies,"And at Leipzig, and just so you get a sense of time. Remember, the invasion of Russia was at the end of 18-- So let me write this down. So the Russian invasion-- let me do this in another color. Do it right here. So the Russian invasion, that was at the end of 1812. That was really kind of the beginning of winter in 1812 that really decimated Napoleon's troops. Then we go to 1813, you're looking at Lutzen and Bautzen. That's in May of 1813."
Social Studies,"So after that winter, that gave Napoleon some time to get his troops together. And things happened slower this day and age. People didn't have perfect intelligence in terms of what was going on in the battlefield. And it actually took time for just information to travel, and for armies to travel. They were traveling mainly on foot at that time. And then August 1813, you had Napoleon's significant victory at Dresden."
Social Studies,"But then finally, 1813, in October-- and at this point the Coalition had convinced Austria to also join in. So this is kind of the ultimate coalition. If you look at most of the coalitions, they seldom had bold Austria and Prussia and Russia and all of these guys. But now they're all piling on. So now you have Austria. Austria is part of the Coalition. And Sweden. And of course, you can't forget what's happening in the Iberian Peninsula. You have all of the rebels in Spain and Portugal."
Social Studies,"So you pretty much have every major power in Europe is now allied against Napoleon. And in October of 1813, especially the Austrians, Prussians, and Russians, they meet him at Leipzig. Which is right over here. And at Leipzig, they outnumber him 2:1. And they were able to take care of him and force him to retreat. So then Leipzig happens, first really major defeat. This is actually an image of the Battle of Leipzig. They call it the Battle of the Nations."
Social Studies,"Because so many belligerents were involved in this battle. People estimate that there were 600,000 soldiers involved. 400,000 thousand on the side of the Sixth Coalition. 200,000 on the side of Napoleon. And they estimate on the order of a 100,000 dead or wounded. So this was a major, major, super bloody battle. And it forced Napoleon to retreat. So he had to retreat from Russia before. And now he's retreating from the Confederation of the Rhine, Which was essentially French-controlled territory."
Social Studies,"So Napoleon is really on his heels. He now is going to defend France. And now remember, at the same time as this, you had that you had all this stuff going on in the peninsula. You had Arthur Wellesley. You remember him right here. He's the British general leading, you could view them as the rebels in Spain and Portugal. At the end of 1813, he's winning a series of victories against the French. And he's pushing into France. This is the Pyrenees Mountains right here."
Social Studies,"He's crossing, he's winning a series of battles in the Pyrenees. And then in a last-ditch effort, Napoleon once again, he's hugely outnumbered. He engages his enemies in battles in northeast France, right around that area. And there's actually a period, there's this six day campaign. And this now, we are in 1814. So Leipzig was at the end of 1813. He retreats. Now we're in 1814. And at the beginning of 1814 in February, you have the Six Day Campaign."
Social Studies,"And this was kind of Napoleon's final shot at really showing his military genius. Despite the fact that he was hugely outnumbered, there were four significant battles where he was essentially able to, at least in those battles, route the Coalition, despite being hugely outnumbered. So he kept showing his military genius. But at some point, the numbers just became overwhelming. And the French troops just couldn't handle the Coalition, especially after being decimated in Russia."
Social Studies,"And then losing significant troops even in some of their victories in what is now Germany, or the Confederation of the Rhine then. And then the allies, the Coalition, eventually in March of 1814, the Sixth Coalition, marches into Paris. And this right here is an image of the Russians marching into Paris, around March of 1814. But Napoleon didn't want to give up. In April Napoleon is telling his generals, let's go retake Paris."
Social Studies,"But finally, the generals are ready to give up on Napoleon, and they refused to follow him. And then Napoleon says hey, then I'm going to tell the troops to follow me. And they're like, well you could try, but they're not going to follow you. So they essentially don't agree to do anything that Napoleon wants. Forcing Napoleon, and it was going to happen one way or the other, this way was just less bloody. In April of 1814-- super important time in history-- Napoleon is forced to abdicate."
Social Studies,"And not only does he abdicate-- maybe I'll do a future video on it-- but he also has to rescind any claim that any of his son or any of his future-- not the word ancestors, what's the opposite of ancestors? Descendants, any of his future descendants might have claim as Emperor of France or King of France. So he's forced to abdicate. Super important time, 1814. So if you think about when Napoleon ruled. Remember, he was able to take power at the end of 1799."
Social Studies,"So it's been on the order of 13 or 14 years where Napoleon has just been the absolute ruler of France. And has been able to really kind of wreak a lot of havoc on Europe. And now, it all comes to an end. And we'll see, it's kind of temporary now. But we're getting near the end of hearing about Napoleon. They force them to abdicate by the Treaty of Fontainebleau. And they exile him to Elba. So this is-- just so you know where Elba is-- a little island off the Italian coast right here."
Social Studies,This is where Napoleon was forced to stay. Doesn't seem like that bad of a place. And they actually let him keep the title of Emperor. And they allowed him to rule over Elba. And he was actually able to do something reasonably constructive things with the island. You're going to see he leaves the island very shortly. But it wasn't that bad.
Social Studies,"In modern days, if someone was indirectly responsible, or directly responsible, for butchering millions of your civilians or soldiers, you wouldn't send him to a place with a nice climate and give him a nice house like this. And allow them actually rule over the island. But I think at this time, all of these generals and kings, they all viewed each other as gentlemen. And they never wanted to be too vicious to each other, just in case things were to come back around to them, I guess."
Social Studies,"But he got exiled to Elba in, as I just said, April of 1814. And then, the Coalition, we'll talk more about this, they put Louis XVI-- you remember Louis XVI, with the whole French Revolution and the Estates-General-- they put his younger brother, they restore him to the crown. This is right here is Louis XVIII. This is Louis XVI's younger brother. They make him King of France. So after all that business about the French Revolution, and then Napoleon comes to power, and all the Rights of Man and all that."
Social Studies,"When everything is said and done, they put a king back in power. This guy, with the satin robes again. Doesn't look too different than his older brother. And just in case you're wondering, hid older brother is Louis XVI. He's Louis XVIII. Who was Louis XVII? This is Louis XVII. Right here. This is Louis XVI's son, he was actually next in line to the thrown before his uncle, or Louis XVI's younger brother, Louis XVIII. But he died while he was in prison."
Social Studies,"If you were a Royalist, you would have considered him king after the beheading, the decapitation of his dad. And actually, there's a hugely fascinating story here where people say that he died in 1795. But many, many people think that he escaped and was able to live a normal life. And who knows what? But needless to say, he wasn't anywhere to be found. So they made Louis XVIII-- Louis XVI's younger brother-- King of France. But, we're going to see, this isn't the last we hear of Napoleon.."
Social Studies,"It also makes the rest of Europe a little worried. They're all monarchies, they don't like this idea of overthrowing your kings. And so during this revolutionary period you have a series of wars with the rest of Europe. Revolutionary France does, essentially, the French Revolutionary Wars. And during that period Napoleon becomes quite famous as the French and maybe the best European military commander. So, now Napoleon is starting to become essentialy a hero in France."
Social Studies,"And by 1799 he is able to come to power in a coup d'état with a couple of other people and then he outmaneuvers them and then by 1804 he becomes the emperor Napoleon and in this whole period he is now trying to expand the Empire so these were the Revolutionary Wars, and these you can consider right over here are the Napoleonic Wars and the pic of the French Empire under Napoleon happens in 1812 and the real downfall if you ask my opinion and many other people would be when he invaded Russia that really decimated the French Grand Armée and we saw in the last video that by April 1814, the 6th coalition was finally succesfull against Napoleon and then he was exiled to the island of Elba where we're taking up the story he only hung out there for a little under 10 months he was separated from his family so that even though he was put in charge of this litle island it wouldn't have been what he wanted and he obviously was an ambitious person on top of that He caught wind of what was happening in France."
Social Studies,"Louis the 18th was there, the nobility returned they weren't treating the old Army veterans well which made him suspect that he may be able to retake control somehow On top of that the French Empire was being shrunken back to its original boundaries which made many people in France a lot less proud so Napoleon started to sense that maybe he could do something."
Social Studies,"On top of that, he caught wind that people might not leave him in Elba because he is Napoleon and they were afraid that he may come back so they might banish him to someplace even more remote, or there might be some attempts to assassinate him So with that in mind, being who he is, and being as creative as he is he's able to somehow escape from Elba, he's able to get a boat, land on the Southern shores of France."
Social Studies,"The French authorities are able to catch wind of this, they send the military to engage with him, this is the French military to essentially confront capture, kill Napoleon on the Southern shores of France and when he sees them, he dismounts from the horse that he's got, he walks up to them completely unarmed and he says, ""go ahead, shoot your emperor"" which is in my mind a fairly gutsy move to do And they rally around him and he's able to actually take control of the army that was sent to capture or kill him and he starts marching to Paris He starts marching to Paris, and Louis the 18th, the brave man that he is catches wind of this and escapes and so by March of 1815 Napoleon is able to retake control of Paris and essentially, France."
Social Studies,"And this is the beginning of what is known as the Hundred Days. It actually is about a 111 days, but it doesn't sound that good."
Social Studies,"So between March 1815, and July 1815 You can imagine, even before Napoleon was able to reach Paris word got around about what was going on That Napoleon was back, they didn't like it They essentially announced that they wouldn't stand by there and that were going to form a new coalition to stop him So Napoleon had two options once he gets in Paris, He could essentially sit and wait wait for the combined forces of Europe to reorganize and then attack him."
Social Studies,"Or he could go on the offensive, he could attack before they had a chance to fully regroup you can imagine, he viewed this as being his best shot so he starts going after the combined forces of Great Britain and Prussia in what is now Belgium And over there is where he engaged in probably some of the most decisive battles, the most decisive one was the battle of Waterloo which is possibly one of the most famous battles in history maybe due to also the Abba song about it and that is where he met the Duke of Wellington on the British side, and Blücher on the Prussian side Napoleon had seventy or eighty thousand troops The other side had a hundred and twenty/thirty thousand troops A extremely bloody battle, more than forty/fifty thousand people killed, injured, missing on and on and on."
Social Studies,"But in the end, Napoleon lost and many historians, there's different reasons for why he lost he actually did a pretty good job considering the scenario the ground because of the weather was very muddy and actually was not good for being on the offense It was very good conditions for being on the defense And you know, Napoleon was essentially trying to take out these somewhat remnant armies before the Coalition, the 7th Coalition essentially had a chance to fully get back to full force But he loses at Waterloo, there are a few skirmishes after that, but the French retreat back to Paris At this point Napoleon sees the writing on the wall He's not completely delusional He sees that if they were able to, especially if the Prussians are able to get him again, they might not let him live They might really do something crazy with him, so he surrenders himself to the British And then they exile him to the isle of Saint Helena which is one of the very remote island which is afraid to be exiled to to begin with."
Social Studies,An just to give a sense of how remote it is This right over here is the South West coast of Africa This is Africa right over here. Saint Helena is right out over here Almost in the middle of the Atlantic between Africa and South America And that's where Napoleon would live out the rest of his life In a very uncomfortable situation much worse than what he had going on in Elba Separated from everyone else.
Social Studies,"And then he dies in 1821 The official cause and this is what many historians do believe actually happened Is that he died of stomach cancer Bu there are many theories that there might have been some type of assassination Some slow arsenic poisoning There was a lot of arsenic in his tissues His body was unusually well preserved after his death That's one of the things arsenic does Some people think that it might have been an inadvertent arsenic poisoning because of the environment that he was in Of the conditions he might have been in, of the paint in the walls, but either way, he really lived roughly throught the last six years in pretty unpleasant conditions, and then died of stomach cancer."
Social Studies,And that was essentially the final end of Napoleon.
Social Studies,"And what I want to give is a little bit of context because in that book, play, movie there is an attempted revolution. And sometimes people try to associate it with the French Revolution. But that is not depicting the French Revolution that people talk about when they talk about the French Revolution. And so I thought I would give a little bit of scaffold of French history in the late 1700s and all the way through the mid-1800s to give a little bit of context on the matter. So let's start off in 1789."
Social Studies,"That's when you have the French Revolution. The First French Revolution, we could say, or the French Revolution, which is the French Revolution that people talk about when they're talking about the French Revolution. It was all about deposing Louis XVI and his wife, Maria Antoinette. This is her body there. I think she just got guillotined. This is her head. It was very bloody revolution. This is the storming of the Bastille right over here. And that starts the beginning of the First Republic in France."
Social Studies,"The First Republic. So there were all these dreams and aspirations that France would now be a country of the people. Not too dissimilar to the United States. But revolutions are not so easy, or so clean, or so fast. And France had to go through a long period of pain before it could really establish itself as a real republic. But let's keep going on further off in history. Let me do that in a different color. I'll do the timeline in white. So let's fast forward. Let's fast forward to 1799."
Social Studies,"This is when Napoleon Bonaparte comes to power. So when people talk about Napoleon, they are talking about Napoleon Bonaparte. We'll see that there are other Napoleons. But if people just say, hey, Napoleon did this or that, they're talking about Napoleon Bonaparte. So this is, Napoleon comes to power. Napoleon. And he officially ends the First Republic in 1804 because he declares himself emperor. But let's fast forward."
Social Studies,"There's many videos on the Khan Academy dealing with the Napoleonic Wars and the French Revolution. But let's fast forward to 1815. So let me do that in white again. So you get to 1815. So let's see. That was about 10 years. I need to go about 16 years. So that would put us at 1815 right over there. 1815 is, essentially, Napoleon faces his Waterloo, which was literally at Waterloo. That's why people talk about facing your Waterloo. So he was banished for a little bit to Elba. He was able to come back."
Social Studies,"He had 100, actually 111 days in power. But then he was finally defeated. And then he was finally put into exile at Saint Helena, where he died. In 1815, you essentially have the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. So Louis XVI's younger brother comes to power. And they call him Louis XVIII."
Social Studies,"So this is Louis XVIII, which raises a very good question-- What happened to Louis XVII? Louis XVII was Louis XVI's son, who died in prison at the age of 10 in 1795 during the Revolution or during the revolutionary period, I guess we could say. So this right over here. This right over here. Napoleon ends -- let me draw. This is Napoleon's-- let me do this in the same color I did Napoleon in. So 1799 to, actually, 1814 is when Napoleon's reign ended but then he came back for a little bit."
Social Studies,"So I'll draw a little bit of a dotted line here. A little dotted line. And then 1814 was the formal restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. And, but of course, Napoleon comes back a little bit. But after Waterloo, it's really firmly established. So you have the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. So this is Louis the XVIII. And then in 1824 he dies. And he dies childless. So let's see. It's about nine years. So that will put us about right over there. He dies childless."
Social Studies,"And so his younger brother, Charles X comes to power. So then you have Charles X. Charles. I'll do all the Bourbons in purple. Charles X. And this is Charles X right over here. And so let's go a little bit further off into history. You fast forward all the way to 1830. You fast forward to 1830. A lot of discontent. And now you have the Second French Revolution. You might say, oh hey, this must be what Les Miserables is all about. No, we're not there yet."
Social Studies,"Les Mis is not about the Second French Revolution, sometimes called the July Revolution. July Revolution. And this revolution actually did not-- it was successful-- but it did not establish a republic at this point. It instead installed-- and this whole time there was a liberalization. The monarchy, even when it was put in power, had a gradual decline in how much power it had. But after the July Revolution, they put in Charles X's cousin. Charles X's cousin who was the Duke of Orleans."
Social Studies,"Who was this guy, this guy right over here. Louis Philippe I. So let me write that. So this is Louis Philippe I. And so you're saying, Sal, you started off this video talking about Les Mis. You haven't mentioned Les Mis yet. Give me a little bit of context. So now I will give you context. So if you watch the movie, it starts off with Jean Valjean. He's at a shipping place where they're repairing ships of some sort. That was in 1815 after Waterloo. So it was under Louis XVIII's regime."
Social Studies,"So that's right over here. Let me see where the start of the movie. The start of the movie is right about there. And then the real climax of the movie, which is this rebellion. There's these barricades being set up in Paris. You have all these young idealistic folks who are trying to overthrow the government. This does not happen until 1832. This is 1832. I'll do it right over here. And what catalyzed that-- there were several things that was catalyzing that."
Social Studies,"And, actually, most revolutions are catalyzed by just economic discontent. If people are rich, and happy, and have jobs, and aren't getting sick, most people aren't in the mood to revolt. But in 1832, as you could imagine, the economic situation was not good. There was also a very nasty outbreak of cholera. And what really catalyzed the events in Les Mis, and they even refer to it in the movie, is the death of this chap right over here. Jean Maximilien Lamarque. Let me write the name down."
Social Studies,"Jean Maximilien-- and I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it-- Lamarque. And he dies in June of 1832. And he was very sympathetic to the plight of the poor, to the plight of the common man. And the average folks said, hey look, he's our guy in government. And he had an influential role in government. When he died, they were like, look, we don't have anybody else in a high position who can speak for us. Let's use his funeral as a catalyst for revolt. And you saw that happening in the movie Les Mis."
Social Studies,"So Les Mis, that climactic moment, that is the June Rebellion of 1832. And it's not-- you don't have to have amazing comprehension of watching movies to realize that this was unsuccessful. So this right here, didn't work. Didn't work. If it did work, It might have been called the Third French Revolution. But it was not. It was an unsuccessful revolution or unsuccessful rebellion, really. And it was that Victor Hugo observed it. And that's why he's able to recount it in so much detail."
Social Studies,"The barricading, the young people, the shooting in the streets, all the rest. So this is a little bit of review. When people talk about the French Revolution, they're usually talking about the French Revolution. Begins to establish the First Republic. It was a successful revolution. The Second French Revolution. This is the July Revolution. This is in 1830. This puts into power Louis Philippe I, the person that they're trying to overthrow in Les Mis. And they don't establish the Second Republic after this."
Social Studies,"For the Second Republic, we have to go all the way to the revolution of-- let me make sure I can scroll properly. Go all the way. So let me continue my timeline. So this is Louis Philippe to go 18 years. 18 years to 1848 where you have the Third French Revolution, which leads to the popular election of Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew. Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte. This guy right over here. But France is still not done. It still can't establish itself as a long-lasting republic."
Social Studies,"In 1851, this character declares himself emperor. So 1851, he too declares himself emperor. And France is not finally freed of kings and emperors until 1870. So let's do this run all the way to 1870 where France, essentially, loses the Franco-Prussian War. And this character, this character right over here, is deposed. And you have the establishment of the Third French Republic.."
Social Studies,"The eastern half of the island, that you don't see here-- I've zoomed in on the western half. The eastern half is now called the Dominican Republic. At that time it was called Santo Domingo and it was in the control of Spain. Let me write that down. So Spain is here. You probably don't see my yellow that well. And then on this side, France has colonized-- let me write Spain bolder. There you go. Spain had colonized the eastern half of the island, France had colonized the western half."
Social Studies,"And just to get us up to speed on the history, in 1492, Columbus showed up and it was a Spanish colony. And I'm talking about just the western side. The eastern side continued to be a Spanish colony. But in 1697, it was officially given over to the French, but it was a Spanish colony until then. And then 1697 until the period that we're talking about right now, which is the late 1700s, the period of the French Revolution, it was a French colony. It's a French colony."
Social Studies,"Now you're probably saying, Sal, all of this craziness is happening in France. Kings are getting toppled, people are getting guillotined. There's wars with all of the empires. Why are you going all the way to this side of the world and focusing on this small little island? Well, the big answer, or I guess the main answer, especially from the perspective of the French-- there's other historical reasons why this, I think, is relevant."
Social Studies,"But the major reason is that Saint-Domingue at this time was the most-- let me write that in-- profitable slave colony in the world. Now these colonialists, they cared about profit pretty much all the time. To a large degree, at this point in history, that's all they cared about. But you have to think about it. Remember, what precipitated the French Revolution-- or what I think was a major factor-- was that France was broke. So you have this little island here. It's a slave colony."
Social Studies,"Their plantations produce tons of sugarcane, hugely profitable business. Anything that goes on in Saint-Domingue will matter to France because France is broke. And not only are they broke, but they have all of these wars with pretty much everybody in Europe. So let's go back and remind ourselves what was actually happening in France at the time. We'll actually go back to France. So 1789, you had your Convocation of the Estates-General."
Social Studies,"The Third Estate, they were a little peeved, so they met at the tennis court, they declared themselves the National Assembly, they had the Tennis Court Oath. Actually, they declared themselves the National Assembly, then they were kicked out of the room. And then they had to do the Tennis Court Oath, where they promised that they would create a constitution. And they started talking about liberty and fraternity and brotherhood and all men are created equal, all of these great ideas of the Enlightenment."
Social Studies,"And while all that was happening, you had this businessman, Vincent Oge. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right. He was a wealthy, mixed-race-- so let me write that down. He was a mixed-race and he was 1/4 African descent and he was 3/4 European, or French descent. And he was in Paris on business. And while he was there, the French Revolution and this Convocation of the Estates-General started happening, and he said, gee, you know what? I'm a wealthy, educated guy."
Social Studies,"I own land in what is now Haiti, but in Saint-Domingue at the time. He actually owned slaves. I want to be very clear about this. He owned slaves as well. And he's like, I am just as good as all of these, I guess you could say, purely European guys all around me, but I don't get equal rights now. But all of this great stuff is happening, with talks of a new constitution. Let me get in on this. And so he started lobbying with several other, I guess you could say, forward-thinking individuals."
Social Studies,"He started lobbying for equal rights. He lobbied for equal rights, the rights to vote and not to be treated like a second-class citizen. Now at first, they were kind of ignored. The National Assembly, they wanted to do good things, but they didn't want to do something so extreme as considering this wealthy, educated, probably well-spoken individual an equal, so they were rebuffed a bit."
Social Studies,"But eventually, in March of 1790, the National Assembly passed an amendment that had the wording, all proprietors ought to be-- and there's some other stuff in between-- active citizens. Well, Mr. Vincent Oge and his collaborators say, hey, this is our victory. This is the wording that tells us, look, anyone who is a proprieter-- I own land, I'm a proprieter-- it says we ought to be active citizens. This gives us the right to vote. So he declared that a victory for his rights, or people like his rights."
Social Studies,"And so he goes back to Saint-Domingue and tells the governor, look, all of this craziness has been happening in France, we have a National Assembly, and they've essentially given me the right to vote. Unfortunately, the governor of Saint-Domingue ignores him, or essentially doesn't listen to him-- ignores what he has to say, and says, I don't care what's going on in France. I'm not going to give you and people like you the right to vote. So this obviously did not make him a happy individual."
Social Studies,"He seems like he has everything going in his favor. Even the national assembly seems to be going in his favor, but the governor ignores him. So he starts a revolt when he returns, and he's essentially rebuffed. He returned in October of 1790, ignored by the governor, so he starts a revolt. Unfortunately, his revolt wasn't successful. And I want to be very clear. When he revolted, he wasn't revolting to abolish slavery, he wasn't revolting to give all black men on the island the right to vote."
Social Studies,"He was revolting to give freemen of color who owned land the right to vote, and that was probably his mistake in the revolt. I want to give you a little sense of the demographics of Saint-Domingue at that time. There were 500,000 slaves of African descent, you had 40,000 white colonialists, and you had 28,000 mixed-race, freemen of color, or however you want to describe them."
Social Studies,"If you're starting revolt to defend only your rights, you're going to get some subset of this 28,000 against a very well-armed, in power, 40,000. Now, if he had thought maybe I should speak in a little bit broader terms-- he was essentially trying to become a part of this club, but if he had spoken in slightly broader terms, maybe he could have tapped into some of the angst of that 500,000. But he didn't, and so his revolt was unsuccessful and he was captured. And then in February 1791, he was executed."
Social Studies,"So it seems like all was for naught. He went through all this trouble to get some freedom. He was ignored, tried a revolt, his revolt wasn't done that well. He was executed, but it started to simmer within the consciousness of the people of African descent at that time. And whether or not his revolt directly lead to what is going to happen over the next few years is unclear, but it did happen and at least he was the first one that really did try to start a revolt in a major way."
Social Studies,"But anyway, after he was executed, there started to be a little bit more murmurrings, especially in the North. Most of the sugar plantations were focused around the North, and obviously, the more plantations, the more profit. And there was actually a voodoo ceremony that was run by an individual whose name was Dutty Boukman. And I looked for pictures of him. I couldn't find any. Unfortunately, there aren't."
Social Studies,"He ran this voodoo ceremony where he essentially instigated a slave uprising in Haiti, or what is now Haiti, but in Saint-Domingue. Remember, look at those demographics. As you could imagine, if the slaves themselves were to rise up against everyone else on the island, you could imagine-- even though they might not be as well organized or as well equipped as the other members-- just by sheer force, they should probably do pretty good. And so in 1791, in August 1791, an all-out slave rebellion begins."
Social Studies,"Now you can imagine, this scares France. Putting aside all of the things of the Revolution and all these new notions from the Enlightenment, here is your most profitable colony in the world, and all of a sudden there's a revolt. People on both sides of the equation are getting slaughtered, plantations are getting burned. From the new government in France's point of view, that's just going to hurt their own profitability. This is at a time, remember, France is broke. They're at wars with other countries."
Social Studies,"So France sends a delegation, headed by this guy right there. His name was-- and I know I'm butchering the pronunciations-- Sonthonax. I don't know the best way to pronounce it. And it was him plus 6,000 or 7,000 troops. And they essentially were sent from France to put down the slave rebellion, to kind of get things back to the way they were. And in order to kind of consolidate everyone on France's side right here, France in April 1792-- so let me write this down."
Social Studies,"The Legislative Assembly, you might remember, a new constitution was created at the end of 1791, and that entailed a new Legislative Assembly. They essentially gave full citizenship to all free people of color. So unfortunately, Vincent Oge was a little bit ahead of his time. If he had just waited a couple of years, he wouldn't have had to revolt. Or maybe he helped to precipitate this. So it's not clear."
Social Studies,"Maybe his revolt, which maybe helped precipitate the eventual slave revolt, which eventually might have helped the Legislative Assembly come to terms with this idea. Maybe he made it happen or maybe it would have happened on its own, but they made full citizens out of free people of color. And they probably did that-- you could view it kind of in a positive or a negative spin. The positive spin was this is consistent with the ideas of the Enlightenment and the Revolution."
Social Studies,"Or if you want to kind of view a more strategizing view on it, they probably said, hey, there's all this craziness going on in Haiti, if we can at least get these people on our side, we might be able to properly suppress these people over here. And let's be clear. Many of these mixed-race freemen of color, they owned slaves themselves. So from their own self-interest, they were actually very similar to the white colonialists in Saint-Domingue at that time."
Social Studies,"If they were a little bit more strategic about it, it might have been just to kind of consolidate the power on the free people on the island, or the landowners on the island. But they sent that message with Sonthonax and 6,000 to 7,000 troops to get things back in order. But you might remember-- and even that-- this made many people very unhappy, even on the island."
Social Studies,"As some of those white colonialists at that time, they weren't the most liberal thinking people and they probably didn't appreciate this idea of freemen of color being able to have all of the same rights as they did. So there was obviously a lot of antagonism against this guy, against Sonthonax right there. And then you might remember that in February 1793-- we saw that in the previous video, or in several videos ago-- February 1793, you start having war with Great Britain."
Social Studies,"And Great Britain had control of this, right here. That is Jamaica. Just to be clear, in green right here, this is Saint-Domingue. And right here, this is Santo Domingo, controlled by the Spanish. So you had a big problem. Here he is, Sonthonax right there. He's antagonized some of the whites, he's trying to put down a slave rebellion, or at least get things back to normal."
Social Studies,"And then all of a sudden you have the British over here, and you have a lot of these white colonialists that start saying, hey, if France is going to be like that, we're going to side with the British. We're going to side with the British or we're going to get help from the British and we're going to use that help from the British to essentially get our way back in Saint-Domingue."
Social Studies,"Now Sonthonax, as far as I can tell, he was of a more liberal persuasion in that he was sympathetic to the plight definitely of people of mixed-race, and even to the plight possibly of slaves themselves. But also, for strategic reasons, he saw the writing on the wall as well. He said, gee, I have 500,000 slaves and we need to fend off the British. This is a pretty bold action. In the history of slavery, this is actually one of the most significant declarations."
Social Studies,"In 1793, in August of 1793-- it might be a reflection of his own ideas, or it might have just been because of the threat from Britain-- Sonthonax declares freedom for all the slaves. He wasn't saying that they would have all of the same rights as land owning men, but he's essentially abolishing slavery. Initially, he did it just in the North, but in September and October, he eventually extended it to all of the French possessions in Saint-Domingue."
Social Studies,"Now you could imagine the slaves that were revolting this entire time, they're a little bit suspicious of this gentleman. He was, it looks like, sent to Saint-Domingue, or what is now Haiti, to put down the uprising. He shows up with 6,000 or 7,000 troops. He tries to side with essentially the enemies of the slaves to put down the uprising. And now all of a sudden, when the British look like a bit of a threat, he's like, hey, I'm ending slavery by myself. I am just declaring slavery to be over."
Social Studies,"And they've been tricked before and they're saying, this is probably some type of a trick just to make us become a little passive so that they can get back at us. And so their leaders were a little bit suspicious of it, but then in February of 1794, this was ratified. His declaration was ratified by the French National Convention."
Social Studies,"And by the time word got to the freed slaves, or the rebelling slaves on the island-- so we're now in May 1794-- the rebel slaves' leader-- and this is a super important name to know-- Toussaint L'Ouverture-- he was the leader of the rebels, and he was a self-educated former slave himself. And actually he proves himself over and over again to be one of the best military generals and actually in much of history."
Social Studies,"In May 1794, Toussaint L'Ouverture-- I'll write his name twice-- decides to essentially join sides with the French Republic, join sides with Sonthonax. Now once again, let's look at the numbers. You have Toussaint L'Ouverture. He is essentially the leader of these 500,000 newly freed slaves. This is essentially the military of the island. He is now the leader of the island. So now he is essentially, you could almost view him as the general or the governor of the island, of this colony."
Social Studies,"Despite the fact that he had very good leadership qualities, he also had a bit of a megalomaniacal side for himself. And so he actually declared himself governor for life. In 1801, he issues a constitution that declares himself governor for life. And in his defense, this wasn't that unusual for this time in the world. I mean, you look across the Atlantic, look with Napoleon's doing. He takes over the French Republic, he essentially is declaring himself emperor and what not for life."
Social Studies,"And this guy says, hey, I have the same right to do it. I've led these people to essentially their freedom. They trust me. I'll declare myself governor for life. And also in his defense-- and this also speaks to him being a step ahead of many of the rulers at this time-- is that he didn't have just plain old slash and burn tactics. He actually did enforce a lot of discipline amongst his troops."
Social Studies,"And we'll see one of his right-hand men, Dessalines-- I know I'm pronouncing it wrong-- he was much more savage with the people that he was fighting against. But Toussaint L'Ouverture was very disciplined and when he came to power, he actually did not try to get revenge on the mixed-race or on the white plantation owners. He realized that, hey, you know what? We are a new people in charge of what is essentially a new country-- or in his mind it's a new country-- but let's not try to rock too many boats."
Social Studies,"Let's try to kind of keep our society going in some reasonable way so that we don't just ruin ourselves into oblivion. And he also did not declare independence from France. So that's an important point too. He didn't want to completely disjoint themselves from France, so no independence. He was just happy essentially being part of the French empire, but he himself will be the governor. You could imagine on two levels, Napoleon was not happy."
Social Studies,"We we remember, in 1799, and especially 1800, Napoleon comes to power, calls himself the First Council. And he's not happy on essentially two grounds. One, there's this upstart here declaring himself governor for life of this island. No one can do that but Napoleon."
Social Studies,"The other problem that Napoleon had is, all of a sudden, once you lose 500,000 slaves and they are now freemen and you now have to pay them maybe slightly better wages instead of just making them do what you want and just extracting all the profits, the island, the colony becomes much, much less profitable. So in the back of his mind, he also wanted to reinstate slavery and you'll see that he does it explicitly later on. So he sends his brother-in-law."
Social Studies,"You need a dirty job to do, you got to send someone you trust. He sends his brother-in-law Charles Leclerc with 40,000 troops-- so Napoleon is definitely taking the situation seriously-- with 40,000 troops to essentially take back the island from Toussaint L'Ouverture. And so you imagine there's this huge battle that goes on on the island of Saint-Domingue, or the western half of the island, or the part that's controlled by the French. And eventually, they start to get the upper advantage."
Social Studies,"It doesn't help, the fact that Toussaint L'Ouverture's-- some of his closest generals or his closest aides, when they kind of see the writing on the wall, when they see that this guy-- in the next video, I'll talk about how barbaric some of the things this guy did was. But once some of Toussaint L'Ouverture's generals started to see the writing on the wall, they actually turned on him."
Social Studies,"And one of them was-- he actually ends up completing the revolution, but while he was fighting for Toussaint L'Ouverture-- this is Jean-Jacques Dessalines-- him and some of the other right-hand men to Toussaint L'Ouverture, he actually joins the side of Leclerc. Leclerc is kind of making it look like he's not trying to reinstate slavery, he's not trying to take citizenship away from people of African descent. He makes it look like he's only trying to take L'Ouverture off of his high horse."
Social Studies,"So this guy says, OK, fine, for the betterment of Saint-Domingue, I'm with you. And at that point, Toussaint L'Ouverture is essentially in a very tough situation. So Leclerc says, hey, Toussaint, let's have some negotiations and maybe we can figure out some way for you to assimilate you and the people you're leading into essentially Napoleon's-- what is now turning into Napoleon's empire."
Social Studies,"So Toussaint L'Ouverture-- being a kind of upstanding individual who trusts people and a man of honor-- he says, oh, this Charles Leclerc must be a man of honor as well. So he meets with him to discuss the terms of assimilation. Well, it turns out Charles Leclerc was not a man of honor. Maybe I could draw some devil horns on him right there."
Social Studies,"And he, when Toussaint L'Ouverture shows up by himself for a very civilized meeting, he gets some people to arrest him, capture him, and then send him on a boat to France, and essentially Toussaint L'Ouverture dies in France in a prison. So I'm going to leave this video here. It's kind of a very sad moment. You have freedom for the slaves temporarily, you have this major historic figure Toussaint L'Ouverture leading the slaves and trying to establish a new government."
Social Studies,"But then it gets violently suppressed by Napoleon's henchman, by Charles Leclerc, his brother-in-law. And I'm going to finish this video just with a quote from Toussaint L'Ouverture because it kind of foreshadows what's going to happen in the next video. So this is actually something that he said on the boat to France after being captured. Let me make the whole quote here. ""In overthrowing me, you have cut down in Saint-Domingue only the trunk of the tree of liberty."
Social Studies,"It will spring up again from the roots, for they are many and they are deep.""."
Social Studies,"You can see in this peach brownish color, it had control all the way south as modern-day Chile and Argentina and all the way as far north as modern-day Texas and California. You also see significant control by the Portuguese in what will eventually be Brazil. The French have at this point some territory, especially in North America and in several islands in the Caribbean and the British, of course, have control along the east coast of North America."
Social Studies,"And they also have several islands in the Caribbean and the Atlantic. As we fast forward 100 years, we're going to see a dramatic change. Notice roughly a hundred years later, most of what used to be these European colonies have now achieved independence. In other videos, we go in some depth from 1776 to 1783. You have the American War for Independence. You see on this map now the United States is an independent country."
Social Studies,"From 1791 to 1804, you have Toussaint Louveture lead the revolt against French control, eventually gaining independence and establishing Haiti. From 1807 to 1830, you have a series of revolutions in Latin America, many of which were led by Simon Bolivar, who was a Crejo, or Creole, Venezuelan. The term Creole has many meanings in modern-day language, but in this context, it refers to someone of mostly Spanish descent who was born in the New World."
Social Studies,"And Simon Bolivar plays an active role in achieving independence from Spain for Venezuela, what will eventually be Columbia and Panama, Ecuador, Peru, and the country that will eventually be named for him, Bolivia. So there is an interesting question here. What led to all of these revolutions? The map that I showed you before, that colonial map of the Americas, these colonies had been in place for several hundred years before these revolutions."
Social Studies,"Why did all of these revolutions happen roughly at the same time? Well, one overarching idea is that as we enter into the 1700s, you have the intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. There were many authors and many publications involved in the Enlightenment, but perhaps most famous is the Encyclopedie in French, or Encyclopedia, which said the intent of collecting much of the scientific and political science, knowledge of the time and is considered one of the central texts of the Enlightenment."
Social Studies,"And it was a series of articles published from the 1750s all the way until the 1770s. And to get a sense of it, here is an excerpt of an article by one of the authors, Denis Diderot, considered one of the primary actors in the Enlightenment. ""No man has received from nature ""the right to command others."
Social Studies,"""Liberty is gift from heaven, and each individual ""of the same species has the right to enjoy ""it as soon as he enjoys the use of reason."" And so when we get into the Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson, he borrows heavily from these ideas of the Enlightenment."
Social Studies,"Now, the Haitian Revolution was partially inspired by these ideas of the Enlightenment, but they were also helped by the fact that France was undergoing its own revolution at the time and it was not in the position to exert strong control over a far flung colony. The French Revolution lasts from 1789 to 1799 at which point Napoleon Bonaparte takes control of France and starts the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon tries to keep control of what would eventually be Haiti, was an incredibly valuable resource."
Social Studies,"It produced a good chunk of coffee and sugar in the world. It was incredibly profitable for the plantation owners and for France as a nation. But between the ideas of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, the slaves of Haiti led initially by Toussaint Louverture, were able to overthrow and set up their own nation, which is the first time that this has happened from a successful slave revolt."
Social Studies,"This is a map of the empire that Napoleon establishes at its peak and as you can see, you see France, but he's able to take over much of modern-day Germany, Italy, he goes to war with Portugal and then eventually Spain as well. Both significant colonial powers in South America. So it's in this context, you have the Enlightenment as we get into the 1700s. You already have the example of the American War for Independence."
Social Studies,"13 colonies being able to declare independence from one of the largest powers at the time. Then a successful slave revolt to establish their own country against another significant power. And once Spain and Portugal are fighting Napoleon coupled with the ideas of the Enlightenment and the examples of the United States and Haiti, it inspires a whole other series of revolts in Latin America, many of which were led by Simon Bolivar."
Social Studies,"And so by the time we get to 1850, much of the European imperialism in the Americas has come to an end.."
Social Studies,"Even the small country of Portugal, because of its prowess during the Age of Exploration, a significant amount of territory in what would become Brazil, but they also have possessions and colonies along the coast of Africa and even things in India, like Goa. You have the British, having possessions in North America, things that would eventually evolve into the United States and Canada."
Social Studies,"At this point in time, France also has significant possessions, which will later be taken by Britain and then an independent U.S. as it grows across continental North America. But the thing to notice in this map is despite these significant possessions, much of the world is not controlled by the Europeans."
Social Studies,"Yes, England also is starting to have a bit of a colonial possession, although at this point it's a corporate possession in eastern India, in Bengal, but much of Africa and Asia is not under European control. But then as we enter into the second half of the 18th century, and especially the 19th century, something important happens in the scope of human history, and that's the Industrial Revolution or maybe you could say the Industrial Revolutions."
Social Studies,"Now, there's many technologies that are central to the Industrial Revolution, but probably most important is the steam engine, although you could contend maybe it's the steam engine, maybe it's electrification, maybe it is the telegraph. But the steam engine all of a sudden allows us to harness the power of really coal to create steam to turn engines. And then these engines could be used to power factories so that you could amplify what human labor could do before."
Social Studies,"This factory right over here, it looks like they're creating fabric from some kind of thread or they might be sewing of some kind. And a human equipped with a power loom or with a sewing machine could produce much, much more than they could've ever produced before by hand. The steam engine and things like electricity also create a revolution in transportation, the transportation of goods and people, but also the movement of information."
Social Studies,"This right over here is a picture of a steamship, which you could use for trade, but you could also use it to project military power. This here is a railroad. Similarly, transport goods and people but it also allows you to keep control over a larger swath of territory. And this is a telegraph. And then a telegraph, all of a sudden, for the first time in history, you can communicate across the globe in a mere instant. And what used to take months to figure out what was going on could now happen in seconds."
Social Studies,"So, once again, this is valuable for trade, but it's also valuable for coordinating military power. So in large part to these revolutions that we're seeing, and we will study more in other videos, the map of the world looks very different roughly 150 years later. This is what the world looks like around the year 1900 and you immediately notice some differences from that previous map."
Social Studies,"Most of those colonial possessions in North and South America are now independent but you notice something dramatic happening in Africa and in much of Asia. Africa has now been carved up by the colonial powers. In this salmon color, you see where the British have control in much of South Africa and then around Egypt and Sudan and parts of East Africa. You see the French have control of Algeria and much of Eastern Africa."
Social Studies,"What started off for the British as a corporate possession in Eastern India has now grown to become a possession of the Crown. You have India, part of the British Empire. Even Japan, which is one of the first Asian countries to industrialize, is in on imperialism. It has control in Korea and in Taiwan. So why this kind of imperialism? There's always the standard motivations for imperialism that we've seen throughout world history. If you have conquest, that leads to more land plus people under your rule."
Social Studies,"And if you have more land, which is for the most part used for agriculture, well, you're going to have more taxes and wealth. So, taxes. And if you have more people, they will have output so you can tax that, but they can also be used, they could be taxed, so to speak, for war. They could produce more soldiers and so the more revenue and soldiers you have, well, that could help you just accrue more and more power."
Social Studies,"And so this is the classic loop that you see why most empires tried to expand and sometimes when they stopped expanding, you see that they started to decline. But now in this video, from the early 18th century to the beginning of the 20th century, we have new things at play. We have the technological innovation from the Industrial Revolution, things like electricity and steam power."
Social Studies,"You see the notion of capitalism come into its prime, this focus on where do you maximize your returns for a given amount of capital that you have? And land is a form of capital, but as we will see or as we saw in some of those pictures, as technology becomes more and more valuable, things other than land become very important forms of capital, like factories, like railroads, like ships."
Social Studies,"And related to these two ideas, you have industrialization, which is the use of technology to become more productive, to increase output. And they all feed off of each other. A capitalist says, how do I get better return on my capital? Well, I should industrialize. I should make my factories more efficient. Well, to make my factories more efficient, I have to also invest in technology to get that industrialization."
Social Studies,"The more I industrialize, the better my profits, and so the more I am going to be able to invest in this cycle. As I'm trying to industrialize, I have all sorts of problems that I'm trying to solve, so it's going to drive the need to improve my technology. And those who develop the technology, well, they're going to have more capital to invest. So, once again, it's creating this cycle which is going to feed the fuel of imperialism. Think about it."
Social Studies,"In the Industrial Revolution, the owners of capital started to have more and more power. If you think about a factory... So that's my factory right over there. It takes raw materials... Raw materials. If you think about it, it's a clothing factory. It might take raw cotton or turn it into thread or it might take that cotton thread and then turn it into some type of fabric and then you have finished goods, maybe this is clothing."
Social Studies,"So even before the Industrial Revolution, people would take raw materials, do something to it, and then you would have finished goods. But now, this center portion is being supercharged by technology, by industrialization. It is really becoming the central focus and it's becoming more productive. So as it becomes more productive, there's a hunger for more raw materials."
Social Studies,"Where do you get those raw materials from? Well, if you're a small country like the United Kingdom or Japan, your raw materials are limited. But, there's the rest of the world and especially the rest of the world that is not at the same level of technological sophistication yet, so you can, perhaps, use your military in order to force them to trade with you."
Social Studies,"Similarly, what do you do with all of those finished goods? You have limited markets on your island, but what if you could sell to the hundreds of millions of people who aren't directly in your country? This desire for more raw materials and more and cheaper raw materials and this desire to sell your goods, the outputs of industrialization, this, to a significant degree, drove this imperialism, this colonization, and in general, a motivation for freer trade in general."
Social Studies,"When the free trade didn't happen freely, sometimes it was forced on the country that was being traded with. And as alluded to already, the technology which helped fuel this Industrial Revolution also made it easier to control a far-flung empire. Before the Industrial Revolution, a country like the United Kingdom being able to control this far-flung empire, this would've been impossible for the Romans or the Persians to do using their technology."
Social Studies,"But now you have the steamship, you have railroads, you have the telegraph, which are parts of this Industrial Revolution but they also allow you to project power and project power much quicker and much more efficiently than ever possible. So once again, technology, industrialization, and capitalism, these were the fuel of the Industrial Revolution. They provided the motivation for colonization, for imperialism, and freer trade in general."
Social Studies,"But then, that was able to be enforced because of that same technology. You could project your power through those steamships, railroads, and the telegraph.."
Social Studies,"China at the time under the control of the Qing Dynasty. Well before this period, Chinese products were in demand in Europe, in particular, Chinese porcelain and Chinese silk. Unfortunate for the Europeans, the Chinese did not have a lot of demand for European products and so you had a balance of trade problem. These products would be exported from China into Europe and you would have hard silver currency going to China."
Social Studies,"And so the imperial powers, especially the British, were looking for a solution, and they eventually found that opium grown in India, which is a highly addictive drug, it's the core constituent of heroin and morphine, could be addictive to the Chinese people and maybe could help solve this balance of trade problem, that silver could then flow outside of China."
Social Studies,"Well you could imagine the Chinese government, the Qing Dynasty, had no interest in opium coming in to China, it was destructive to their society, it was an addictive drug, but in 1839, the British decide to force the issue and you have what will be known as the First Opium War."
Social Studies,"This is a picture of the Second Battle of Chuenpi, you see the British vessel Nemesis, which is actually owned by a company, the British East India Company, destroying Chinese junk ships and because of this show of force and this military superiority, they were able to win the First Opium War and extract major concessions from Qing China."
Social Studies,"The Chinese had to open up five ports to trade with the British, they had to give the island of Hong Kong to the British indefinitely and the British would keep control of it all the way until the end of the 20th century. The Chinese had to pay for opium that they destroyed, they had to give reparations to the British to pay for the costs of the war."
Social Studies,"Now to add insult to injury, the British were not satisfied and in 1856, you have the Second Opium War, where they tried to extract even more concessions from China, after which opium is legalized, the whole time opium flooding into the country and really undermining the social fabric of society."
Social Studies,"To make matters worse for China, you have a major civil war in this time period, the Taiping Rebellion, which was started by this sect of Christianity that viewed it as their destiny to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and this is one of the most bloody civil wars that any nation has seen in history, with over 20 million people being killed and historians believe that the Qing concessions to the British and then the French and also the opium that was undermining Chinese society was a major contributor to this long and bloody civil war."
Social Studies,"These opium wars are often cited by Japanese in this time period as a reason for their need to industrialize and become imperial power so that they don't get unraveled the same way that Qing China does by the Europeans. But to appreciate that this was even controversial in Europe. William Gladstone, as we enter into the First Opium War, was a young parliamentarian in Britain and he will eventually be, at the end of the 19th century, a significant British prime minister."
Social Studies,"But as the opium war was beginning, he gave a famous speech in Parliament. ""It is a matter of certainty that if we stopped ""the exportation of opium from Bengal and broke up ""the depot at Lintin and checked the cultivation of it ""in Malwa and put a moral stigma upon it, that we should ""greatly cripple if not extinguish the trade in it. ""The great principles of justice ""are involved in this matter."
Social Studies,"""You,"" and he's talking to I believe the Foreign Minister who is an aggressive proponent of the opium wars, ""You will be called upon to show cause for your present ""intention of making war upon the Chinese. ""They gave us notice to abandon the contraband trade, ""the trade in opium."
Social Studies,"""When they found that we would not, they had the right ""to drive us from their coasts on account of our obstinacy ""in persisting in this infamous and atrocious traffic."" And opium was addictive and William Gladstone had personal experience with this, his sister became addicted to opium."
Social Studies,"He went on to say, ""I am not competent to judge how long ""this war may last, but this I can say, that a war ""more unjust in its origin, a war more calculated ""in its progress to cover this country with permanent ""disgrace, I do not know, and I have not read of."" And a few days later, he wrote, ""I am in dread of the judgments of god upon England ""for our national iniquity towards China.""."
Social Studies,"Settler colonialism is exemplified by the Americas, Australia, South Africa, where you have the empire sending people from their country to settle that territory, oftentimes displacing indigenous people and becoming the ruling class. Then you have economic colonialism whose primary goal is to feed the purported needs of the Industrial Revolution. India and Indonesia are good examples of this. You're looking for raw materials to feed your increased productivity, and you're also looking for markets."
Social Studies,"And so, in this context, as we think about the evolution of Japan from being extremely isolated to becoming an imperial power, think about which of these motivations was primary to Japan. Or maybe was there a third motivation? Let's begin in the 19th century. Japan is in control of the Tokugawa shogunate, who has closed the country to foreigners. One of the purported reasons is fearing the influence of Christian missionaries as early as the 17th century. You have the British in India."
Social Studies,"You have the Spanish who have been in the Philippines for several hundred years at this point. You have the Dutch in control of much of what will eventually be Indonesia. This orange color shows where the French already have a strong hold in Indo-China and Southeast Asia. And then this peach color, this is what they would eventually control as we get into the latter half of the 19th century."
Social Studies,"But to really understand Japanese motivations in the 19th century, you have to think about what was happening in Qing China as we talk about in the video on the Opium Wars. The British and other imperial powers want access to Chinese markets. The Europeans want Chinese porcelain and Chinese silk. But the Chinese weren't interested in trading with the Europeans. The Europeans, especially the British, eventually do find something the Chinese want and that's opium, which is an addictive drug."
Social Studies,"It's the core ingredient in heroin and in morphine. The Chinese government of course does not want that opium inside the country, but as we talk about in previous videos, the British are able to force their way in with the First Opium War, often referred to as gunboat diplomacy. And after winning the First Opium War, the British are able to extract concessions from the Chinese including opening up these ports. And even that does not satisfy the British."
Social Studies,"And so, you have the Second Opium War from 1856 to 1860, after which opium, this addictive drug, is legalized. And to make matters worse for China, during the same period, they have an incredibly bloody civil war where over 20 million people die. Historians think in part due to the lack of confidence in the Qing Dynasty because of the Opium Wars and the opium itself that is very destructive to society. Now, the Japanese were watching all this, and they also had their own interactions with the West."
Social Studies,"In 1853, the American Commodore Matthew Perry comes in with some of his ships into Edo Harbor, which is modern day Tokyo, and is able to convince the Japanese to trade with the United States. The term convinced should be used very carefully because once again, this was a form of gunboat diplomacy. The Japanese saw the ships that Commodore Perry traveled with, and they knew what had happened during the First Opium War. And they were in no mood to have the same thing happen to them."
Social Studies,"Especially when Commodore Perry returned in 1854 with even more ships, the Japanese decided, why fight them? We will open up and allow some trade. And this is a very big deal. Remember, the Tokugawa shogunate had closed the country for over 200 years, but now they saw the writing on the wall. They could not defend themselves against the American warships. Like in China, these concessions in Japan to the Americans began to undermine trust in the Tokugawa shogunate."
Social Studies,"And to get a feel for what people were thinking in the mid-19th century in Japan, we have some quotations from Shimazu Nariakira, who was the daimyo of Satsuma, which is at the southern tip of Japan right over here. But he was considered to be a leading thinker of the time. And this photograph, it's not so clear, but this is believed to be the first photograph taken by Japanese. That gives you a sense of the time, that photography daguerreotypes were starting to be in use."
Social Studies,"""It was inconceivable that China would deteriorate to such a degree."" Remember, we're talking about the Opium Wars. We're talking about the Taiping Rebellion. ""With its vast territory and population, ""there could not have been a dearth ""of loyal and devoted patriots. ""Yet since the Opium War its administration ""has been in disorder and ineffective. ""It has been plagued by rebellion ""while England and France have invaded it from without."
Social Studies,"""Japan lies to the east of China, ""and is in such a position as to necessitate ""immediate steps to prepare against meeting the same fate ""as that which has befallen the Chinese; ""as soon as England achieves its design in China, ""it will most certainly direct its military might eastward. ""If we take the initiative, we can dominate; ""if we do not, we will be dominated."" And this last sentence is often quoted."
Social Studies,"""If we take the initiative, we can dominate; ""if we do not, we will be dominated."" It's almost advocating for a reactionary imperialism. Become an empire or become part of someone else's empire. And this is the path that Japan goes down. In 1867, you have the young Emperor Meiji come to power, who was only 15 or 16 years old at the time. This would be the beginning of what is known as the Meiji Restoration. You could say that it's a restoration of power back to the emperor."
Social Studies,"The emperor existed even during the shogunate but was a figurehead. It was the shogun who had the power. But now, the emperor was able to take back the power from the shogunate. But the Meiji Restoration is perhaps even more important in that it took Japan from being a closed, feudal country, and in only a few decades, to a modern industrial imperial power. Here are some data that gives you a sense of this. 1875, 600,000 metric tons of coal produced. 1913, 21.3 million. So it's grown almost 40 fold."
Social Studies,"1873, 26 steamships. 1913, 1,514 steamships. Railroad track, 1872, only 18 miles. By 1914, 7,100. Emperor Meiji dies in 1912, but as we get into 1914, you start to see World War I. And as we talk about in other videos, this industrialization of Japan allows it to be a major actor in World War I. As we exit the 19th century and we also go to the 20th century, we see Japan leveraging its industrial might that we see in numbers here in terms of taking over territory and becoming an imperial power."
Social Studies,"In this flashing red, this is what Japan is able to take over by the end of World War II. They were able to take over Korea at the beginning of the 20th century. And even though Hitler's invasion of Poland is often given as the start of World War II, Japan's occupation and very brutal occupation of Northeast China is often considered the real start of World War II."
Social Studies,"As World War II progresses, Japan is able to take more and more territory, French Indo-China, British Burma, the Dutch Indies, Indonesia, Philippines. And this empire only comes to an end when Japan has to surrender at the end of World War II in 1945. So, go back to the previous question. What type of colonial power was Japan? It definitely wanted the natural resources. In fact, especially when it was at war, it needed access to oil which Indonesia had."
Social Studies,"It needed access to natural resources that all of these areas had, but there was also this element of wanting to be a major player on the global stage in fear that if it wasn't, it might become a victim of colonization itself.."
Social Studies,"And just to get a sense of what our modern world looks like, and especially what modern Europe looks like, this is a map of modern Europe. But the interesting thing about this map is instead of being the traditional map that you normally see where you just see the country boundaries, the state boundaries, this has the state boundaries right And these little gray lines, these show where France ends and, say, Switzerland or Germany or Italy begins."
Social Studies,"But overlain on top of that we see where the languages are spoken. So this is actually much more focused on, where do people speak French. Where do people speak German? And the thing that you will notice is, for the most part, throughout most of Europe, today's boundaries, the modern boundaries closely, closely match up to where languages are spoken. There are a few areas where there is more of a disconnect with Catalan and Spanish. And actually, that is leading to some issues."
Social Studies,"But for the most part, in modern Europe, the country boundaries and the linguistic boundaries or the national boundaries kind of match up. If we rewind to the world of entering into World War I, things were very different. Some of the boundaries we recognize. We recognize the United Kingdom. Well, Ireland has since been carved out. But we recognize it as not being that different than it is today. Spain is not that different. France is not that different. Italy is not that different."
Social Studies,"Germany is a good bit different. In fact, if you take Germany, the German Empire entering into World War I, or the early 1900s, around 1914, between them and the Russian Empire, they essentially were swallowing up a bunch of linguistic groups right over here that now have their own independent states. The other thing that you might notice is this huge state called Austria-Hungary, or often called the Austro-Hungarian Empire."
Social Studies,"And people say, well, there's-- I'm familiar with some of these nations that have the word Austria and Hungary in them, but I'm not-- what is this Austro-Hungarian Empire? And what's interesting about it is it really was an empire. It was really trying to cobble together all of these folks that spoke all different-- all the different types of ethnicities. This is kind of a zoom-in of the Austro-Hungarian Empire leading into World War I."
Social Studies,"And the Austro-Hungarian Empire is probably the most important thing to understand if we're trying to get a sense of how World War I started, because leading up to World War I, in 1908, the Austro-Hungarian Empire formally annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina. And that's another confusing thing for many of us, that that's actually one country. It's called Bosnia and Herzegovina, or I guess for the Austro-Hungarians that was now one region that they annexed."
Social Studies,"And what's interesting about that is if you look at the linguistic map, you see that this whole region right over here speaks a very similar-- essentially, they're dialects of Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian. They're all very linguistically and ethnically connected, so this whole region right over here is linguistically and ethnically connected."
Social Studies,"And what we'll see is, is that this desire to connect people with similar ethnic or linguistic roots-- linguistic backgrounds is what led to a lot of what happened in World War-- or at least was the spark that fueled, that people sometimes say, the powder keg of World War I. The other thing that was a very different or the other country or nation or empire that we are not used to today is the Ottoman Empire. So if we go today, we see the country of Turkey, which is on the Anatolian Peninsula."
Social Studies,"So this is Turkey right over here. This is modern-day Turkey. But entering into World War I in 1914, Turkey was essentially part of the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. So this right over here is what the Ottoman Empire looked like. This right over here is roughly modern-day Turkey. But the Ottoman Empire consisted of modern-day Turkey and much of the modern Middle East."
Social Studies,"So much of-- especially, much of the Arab-- especially the Arab world around Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, much of what where modern-day Israel is, some of Saudi Arabia. And this was really the dying state of the Ottoman Empire. At its peak, it controlled much of the Muslim world. It controlled Northern Africa as well as all the stuff you see here and even a little bit of Persia and actually a good bit of the Balkans, southeast Europe, and even Greece at the peak of its Ottoman Empire."
Social Studies,"And now I'm talking about going hundreds and hundreds of years back into the past. So when we enter into World War II, we don't have a world where people are, where states are defined by linguistic boundaries or by ethnic boundaries. To a large degree, we had these empires that had existed as we exited out of the 1800s. And these empires were not just in Europe, like the Austro-Hungarian Empire or not just in the Middle East, like the Ottoman Empire."
Social Studies,"Right over here is an empire map at around that point in time. And you see, probably the most dominant feature here is the British Empire. That's in this pink color. So British, that's the United Kingdom. Great Britain would just be this right over here. You throw in Ireland. You get the United Kingdom. Great Britain was in control of the Indian, the entire Indian subcontinent. It was essentially although nominally Egypt was somewhat independent, Great Britain had a huge amount of influence here."
Social Studies,"Obviously places like Canada and Australia and New Zealand were under control of or a part of the British Empire. What a lot of people don't realize is a significant amount of Africa as well. A significant amount of Africa was also under British control. And what we have running up into World War I is kind of a race for empire, an arms race between the major powers of Europe. In particular, you have Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, that obviously had a vast empire."
Social Studies,"The sun never sets on the British Empire. And it wasn't ever setting on this empire that we just saw here. And the German Empire was also starting to flex its muscle and starting to militarize. And the more that the German saw that the British were militarizing, the more that the British-- the more that the Germans would want to militarize and vice versa, and you just had this arms race. And they were all trying to build their empires. So the Germans, they were present in Africa."
Social Studies,"You have the French who were present in much of Africa. And you have to remember all of this in context. Some of this empire building was, frankly, just about ego and just about spreading someone's influence, spreading their power. A lot of it was based on ethnic beliefs about civilization. I guess these were rationalization to take control of other people's resources."
Social Studies,"And a lot of it was we were in a world where access to resources-- in particular, access to raw materials and especially oil-- could, to some degree, define whether a power was a power at all. And so with that, I think we have a pretty good basis for the state of affairs as we enter into World War I.."
Social Studies,"But of the major powers, Germany and Italy were relatively new as unified states. The British Empire-- they had been building their empire for hundreds of years. The Germans, on the other hand, even though they have a very old culture going back hundreds-- or you could argue thousands-- of years, as a unified state, they only existed since 1871. And that's only after the Franco-Prussian War, which allowed the Prussians to unify all of Germany."
Social Studies,"And the Italians only became fully unified in 1870, also due to the Franco-Prussian War. Because the French had to focus on the Germans, had to focus on the Prussians, they couldn't protect the Papal States anymore. And so that allowed the Italians to unify it under their a rule. So by the time we get to 1914, the beginning of World War I, these two powers, they were also on their race for empire. But they were only about 43 or 44 years old."
Social Studies,"And so they hadn't been able to build as extensive of an empire as France and, especially, as extensive of an empire as Great Britain. But this map right over here shows how far their actual empires did extend. Italy had control of Libya, Eritrea, and parts of what's today Somalia. And Germany had control-- it also had holdings in Africa, possessions in Africa. Togoland, which is modern-day Togo; Cameroon, which makes up-- modern-day Cameroon is part of German Southwest Africa. That's now known as Namibia."
Social Studies,"German East Africa, which is now Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi. And Germany also had holdings in the Pacific and even in China. These are the Pacific Islands that Germany had possession of. It had German New Guinea. And it even had control of the town of Tsingtao. And that actually is culturally interesting for those of you watching this video in 2013. Tsingtao is now a very popular Chinese brand of beer. One of the more-- I think it's the number two in the market Chinese beer."
Social Studies,"And it's associated with China. But it was actually started by German settlers in Tsingtao in 1903. So actually its roots are with the Germans, who obviously have a long tradition of producing beers. And so Tsingtao-- you could argue it's a Chinese beer. It's produced in China. But it had its roots in German imperial rule.."
Social Studies,"There were many other alliances that were tangentially related. But I tried to distill down the ones that were directly related to all of the dominoes falling in 1914 that led to all of Europe being essentially at war with each other. So to understand that, we have to rewind 75 years. So World War I starts in 1914. 75 years before that, in 1839, you have the Treaty of London. And the Treaty of London did many things."
Social Studies,"But Article 7 is what's relevant to the beginning of World War I, where Britain agrees to protect the neutrality of Belgium. And if you're skeptical, you might say, hey, this is a 75-year-old treaty. Why does this matter anymore? And that, actually, would be a good question. Really, all of these alliances-- it's a very healthy debate you can have as to whether these are the direct causes of why one of these powers declared war on the other. Or whether these were just excuses."
Social Studies,"These were a legal pretext for saying, oh, I need to declare war on you. When in reality, they really did want to declare war for a whole set of reasons to keep the other person's empire in check, to flex their military muscle, to go after more territory in their empires. Who knows what it might be? But needless to say, 1839 was the legal basis for the British Empire to protect Belgium. Now, you fast-forward 40 years, you get to 1879."
Social Studies,"You have a newly born German Empire out of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. That newly born German empire, they just had-- essentially, it's an extension of Prussia, fundamentally, a German kingdom. They just had a war with France. They took some very valuable territory from France. They're paranoid that France wants to get back at them. They're paranoid about the Russians. And they have some connection with the Austrians-- the Austro-Hungarians, I should say."
Social Studies,"And so in 1879, they sign the Dual Alliance Treaty between Germany and Austria-Hungary to protect each other if Russia attacks. They have this common enemy right over here, Russia. So they are going to-- let me do this in a different color. They are going to protect each other. So this makes the new German Empire feel a little bit better about its position in Europe, in case they were to get into a war with either of these characters."
Social Studies,"Then in 1892-- you could imagine, if you ever play a game of Risk or if you ever play the game of Diplomacy, which is actually based on what happened in World War I. If you see some people that you might be at war with starting to become friends, you want to look for other friends, other alliances that you can form in case they declare war on you. So in 1892, you have an alliance between the French and the Russians, the Franco-Russian Military Convention. So this is an alliance."
Social Studies,"Let me do this in the magenta color again. You have an alliance between France and Russia. And then finally, in the early 1900s, 1904 to 1907, you have a series of agreements. ""Entente"" essentially means agreements. Agreements between the British Empire and France, between the British Empire and the Russian Empire, to essentially get on good terms with each other. These weren't as formally bonding that, hey, if someone's going to attack you, I'm going to attack them."
Social Studies,"But they were, essentially, able to resolve a lot of their issues on what's going on in their other imperial conquests. And they formed what is called the Triple Entente, the triple agreement between Britain, between the British Empire-- and right here, I just circled the United Kingdom-- France, and Russia. And on the other side of that, you had the Triple Alliance. You have Germany. You have Austria-Hungary. And you also have Italy."
Social Studies,"Now, the reason why, even though entering into World War I, Italy was formerly part of the Triple Alliance. And there were treaties between Italy and Germany to become part of this Triple Alliance. The reason I don't focus on those is once the war started, Italy did not go on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary. It went on the side of the Allies, on the side of the Triple Entente."
Social Studies,But this will give you a good background for why what would seem like a regional skirmish in southeast Europe turns into a pan-Europe and eventually pan-global war..
Social Studies,"of Yugoslavia which was quite ugly during the fall of Communism in the late '80s and early '90s. So first of all, it's a good idea to just understand where the word Yugoslavia comes from. It's literally referring to the southern Slavic states. So Yugo- is referring to southern. And -slavia, we're talking about the Slavic states. And when people talk about Slavic languages, they're talking about the languages that are spoken in this region, but also much of Eastern Europe, and in what is now Russia."
Social Studies,"Now, what we have here in blue is, we have shaded in where Serbo-Croatian is spoken, which is the dominant Slavic language in this region. And there are multiple dialects. Some people will say, oh, it's Croatian or Montenegrin or Serbian or whatever it might be. But mostly, linguists say, well, they're pretty close to each other. And you can categorize them as one language as Serbo-Croatian. And you see that it's now spoken in modern day Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro."
Social Studies,"And that is the commonality here, the thing that ties together this region. Now on top of that, the Slovenian language is also Slavic language that is closely related to Serbo-Croatian. In Macedonia, they also speak a Slavic language. It's closer to Bulgarian. But it has some close ties. It's not completely different than Serbo-Croatian. So you have this linguistic connection throughout this area. Now, what divides this area is really religion and history."
Social Studies,"So this area, if you look, go back hundreds of years, it was under the control of various empires, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire. Different-- the Austro-Hungarian Empire, you're dealing with the Roman Catholic Empire. When you're talking about the Ottomans, you're dealing with the Muslim Empire. And they held in different parts of this territory for hundreds of years. And so what you end up, is really a mix of religions."
Social Studies,"And that often gets tied to people's-- what they perceive as also their ethnicities. And so what I have here is a break down, the religious breakdown of the state, the former state of Yugoslavia. So in this pinkish color right over here, I have the areas that are predominately Roman Catholic. And I say, predominantly, because it really is all mixed together. So Slovenia, Croatia, primarily Roman Catholic. If you look at Serbia and Montenegro, primarily Eastern Orthodox."
Social Studies,"Kosovo, you have a strong Muslim majority right over there. And it really gets-- and Kosovo, before its break up, was kind of part of Serbia and Montenegro. Despite it having this very different religious makeup. And then, Bosnia and Herzegovina is where things get really, really mixed up. Roughly half of the population, and it's been moving over the centuries. But the dominant religion there is Islam."
Social Studies,"And in general, and this is where it can be confusing, when people talk about a Bosniak, when they're talking about a Bosniak, they're talking about a Bosnian Muslim. But Bosnia and Herzegovina also has significant fractions of Serbs who are Eastern Orthodox. So that's why I put the brown here as well. It's about a third of the population. And it also has a pretty sizable Roman Catholic population. Or we could say Bosnian Croats. So just to be clear here, it can be very confusing."
Social Studies,"Even when you when you hear history of it or when you've heard it on the news. I remember the '90s hearing this on the news and getting very confused. If someone's referring to a Bosnian Muslim or Bosniak, that's a Muslim living in Bosnia. That's they tend to be referring to. If they say a Bosnian Croats, this would be an ethnically Croat who is living in Bosnia. And they are-- it would tend to be Roman Catholic."
Social Studies,"And then if you have a Bosnian Serb, this is someone who ethnically identifies themselves as a Serbian or as a Serb who lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But is probably going to be Eastern Orthodox. So you can imagine, you have the strong linguistic and even ethnic ties. But at some point, because of the religion and dialect changes, there's also significant amount of differences here. Especially when things got ugly, as you have the fall of Communism."
Social Studies,"So hopefully, this lays the groundwork of the commonalities and the differences here. And it'll help us understand what got us into World War I, or at least what triggered World War I. And also some of the ugliness that was seen in the early '90s. And just to finish up with a little bit of context, this was not a unified state until-- World War I, to some degree, was precipitated by a desire to make this a unified state."
Social Studies,"This ethnic grouping, this linguistic grouping tended to be broken up with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire. Entering into a World War I, you started to have the decline of the Ottoman Empire which started to allow these people to start to have more energy behind their desire to form a unified state. World War I was essentially the catalyst that allowed the state of Yugoslavia to unify. And in different forms, it stayed unified until the fall of Communism."
Social Studies,"And even though it was a socialist state, a communist state during the Cold War, it actually always had a strange and distant relationship with the Soviet Union. But after the fall of Communism, that was kind of holding it together, these, especially these religious differences, frankly, and these ethnic and religious differences broke it apart.."
Social Studies,"But then in 1908, it formally annexes it. And just as a little bit more backdrop, as the Ottomans were being pushed out of the Balkans, it helped rekindle or bring about more hope of unifying the Yugoslavic people, the southern Slavic people. When people talk about Yugoslav, they're literally talking about the southern Slavs. So that literally means southern. So you had these nationalistic hopes. But now in 1908, it was already being occupied."
Social Studies,"A significant state, that would be part of a potential future Yugoslav, was now formally annexed by the Austro-Hungarians. Now, you also had an independent kingdom of Serbia right here. And you can imagine that this was the home base of the nationalistic movement. If only they could add the other southern Slavic states to this, it could one day turn into a greater Yugoslavia. So in that context, we get to 1914. So let me draw a little line here. So we're getting to 1914."
Social Studies,"June 28, which is one of the most famous dates in all of history. And you have the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie. They're visiting Sarajevo which is now in annexed Bosnia. And when they are there, there is a ploy. There is a scheme to assassinate them, from a group-- they're called the Young Bosnians. They have ties to the Black Hand, which is this nationalistic group. That has ties, many, many people say-- all these things are all very shady and behind the back, behind the scenes."
Social Studies,"But it has ties to elements in the kingdom of Serbia. They attempt to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand. And it's actually a fascinating story because the initial assassination attempt is completely, completely botched. There's even one case of a guy, one of the guys who tried to be an assassin when it gets botched, he tries to bite on a cyanide capsule and then jump into a river. The cyanide capsule had gone bad. The river was only 10 inches deep. And so they were able to get their hands on him."
Social Studies,"And one of the conspirators, Gavrilo Princip-- at this point, once the whole thing was botched, he gives up on the whole assassination attempt. And he's having, literally, a sandwich at a cafe in Sarajevo, thinking about how botched their whole attempt was. And while that was happening, a mistake on the part of those planning Archduke Franz Ferdinand's route as he was traveling within Sarajevo has them driving right near Gavrilo Princip."
Social Studies,"So he sees, all of a sudden, that they've taken the wrong route, that they're driving right by him again. Remember, his people already knew that there was an assassination attempt on him earlier in the day. So they should have been more careful. Now, Gavrilo Princip gets up, puts his sandwich down, and starts walking over to where he sees Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Sophie's car going. Now, the drivers, once they realized that they had made a mistake, they had taken a less safe route."
Social Studies,"They tried to back up, which makes things even worse because then the car starts stalling. And Gavrilo Princip literally walks up to the car and is able to shoot Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Sophie. And just to give you a sense of how important this is, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria is the heir. He's the nephew of Franz Josef, who was the ruler of Austria-Hungary. And so he is the heir to the empire. And so he gets assassinated by Gavrilo Princip. So Franz Ferdinand assassinated by Gavrilo Princip."
Social Studies,"And we have right over here a picture right after Gavrilo Princip-- I believe this is Gavrilo Princip right over here, right after he was arrested. And just to get a little sense of how this was tied to this whole Yugoslavian nationalistic movement. This is what he said once he was arrested."
Social Studies,"""I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be free of Austria."" So this act, this assassination motivated by a nationalistic movement, motivated by a desire to maybe merge Bosnia and Herzegovina with Serbia and maybe eventually Croatia, with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. This assassination, as we'll see in the next video, is the trigger for all of World War I."
Social Studies,"And the reason why it triggers it is because, well, there's many things you can cite. You could argue that many of the empires in Europe were already militarizing, already had a desire for conflict. But then you also had all of these alliances that essentially allowed the dominoes to fall in all of Europe. And because they had these empires, essentially much of the world to be at war with each other.."
Social Studies,"And they viewed them as this small, little, weak country right below them. And so they use this to, essentially, issue an ultimatum. Essentially say, look, immediately bring all the people who did this to justice, all the people who might have conspired with the Gavrilo Princips to allow this assassination attempt to occur, and do it or else, and accept full responsibility."
Social Studies,"And actually, the kingdom of Serbia was in no mood to get into a war with Austria-Hungary, and so they tried their best to comply, but their best wasn't enough. So then July 28, a month later, you have the Austrians declaring war on the Serbians. Now up until this point, the Austro-Hungarian empire is thinking, OK, Serbia is a small, little kingdom here. It has some ties and obviously, it's a Slavic nation so it has some linguistic ties with the Russian empire."
Social Studies,"The Russian empire also had some political ties to it, but Russia is not going to get into a war with us over this. We're justified in attacking them. They've just killed the heir to our throne. So we're going to go in there and Russia is probably not interested in actually creating a larger skirmish here. That was a severe miscalculation on the part of the Austrians. The Russians were not happy about this."
Social Studies,"They felt close ties to the Serbians and they felt a need to protect the Serbians, or you could argue, that maybe they wanted to mobilize just to scare the Austrians. Whatever it might be, whether it was Russia wanted to get into a war, whether they were really looking to protect the Serbians, or whether they were looking to mobilize to scare the Austrians from actually attacking, the Russians began to mobilize. So the Russians began to gather their troops. So the Russians mobilize."
Social Studies,"And now, this is where all of the alliances start to come into effect. If you remember about the alliances we talked about several videos ago, if you go to 1879, you have the Dual Alliance Treaty between Germany and Austria-Hungary to protect each other if Russia attacks and actually, if Russia attacks or mobilizes. So now, Germany is like, hey, maybe I am obligated to protect Austria-Hungary from Russia. You also have to remember in 1892, the Franco-Russian Military Convention."
Social Studies,"Military assistance both ways in the event of attack. So Germany is thinking, look, we signed this treaty and we, to some degree, are maybe eager for war because we've been militarizing so much. And I can't just fight Russia. I also know that France and Russia have this alliance right over here. So Germany in quite surprising quickness decides to declare war on both. So on August 1, Germany declares war on Russia."
Social Studies,"And then on August 3, Germany declares war on France because they know or at least they feel that they can't declare war on only one of them. And they wanted to do it very quickly because they didn't want Russia a chance to mobilize too much. And the fact that they were able to do this so quickly-- we're talking three days after Austria declares war on Serbia and then another two days declare war on France-- kind of shows that Germany was already in a war footing."
Social Studies,"It's not a joke to all of a sudden invade or declare war on countries. So Germany was, essentially, preparing for this. And this right over here gave them the excuse to, essentially, declare war. So they declare war on both of these characters, Germany against Russia. Germany is declaring war on France. Now, the easiest way for them to move into France-- so they're literally going on the offense here-- is for them to go through Belgium. But the Germans were aware."
Social Studies,"They're aware that there's this 75-year-old treaty, the Treaty of London in 1839, Article 7 said that Britain was to protect the neutrality of Belgium. And Germany was in no interest to get into a war with the British. The British had a powerful military, especially a very powerful navy. The Germans said, hey, let's just take on the Russians and the French for now."
Social Studies,"And so they actually reached out to the British and said, hey, this little treaty that you got here from 1839, this 75-year-old treaty, you don't really take this seriously, right? I mean if we have to go through Belgium, you're not really going to hold true to this treaty? And the British said, no, we actually take that very seriously. Obviously, the British didn't want the Germans to be aggressive here. The British didn't want the Germans to be able to invade France."
Social Studies,"And so on August 4 when Germany, essentially, rolls through Belgium, Germany invades Belgium to get to France, this gave the legal justification for the British to declare war on Germany. And so in a matter of only-- I mean not even, we're talking a few months here from the assassination of Franz Ferdinand of Austria, you essentially have all of the major powers of Europe. And then as we'll see because they had these empires, in not too long most of the world is at war with each other.."
Social Studies,"Austro-Hungary , you're talking about this empire here. Huge economy, huge military industrial complex, huge army. Serbians, much smaller country, much poorer country. They had also fought several recent wars."
Social Studies,"They were very ill-equipped so any military analyst would thought that this would be a short war, but 1914 did not prove that way for the Austro-Hungarians and this actually could be viewed as a huge victory, a huge surprise, for the Serbians, that the Serbians were able to keep the Austro-Hungarians back. Serbians hold. Now this isn't to say that it wasn't incredibly, incredibly, incredibly bloody. You've had several offensives across the border into Serbia."
Social Studies,"The Austro-Hungarians briefly captured Belgrade. Then the Serbians capture it back. In the meantime tens and hundreds of thousands of folks were dying, but at the end of 1914, you would have surprised the military analyst and the Serbians were able to hold despite being less equipped and despite just being a smaller country. Now the luck for the Serbians did not hold out that well as we go into 1915. By 1915, other parties other than the Austro-Hungarians decided to get involved against the Serbians."
Social Studies,"In particular, you have the Bulgarians that prior to 1915, they were kinda trying to figure out which side of the war they want to fall in on, but they have had several battles or several wars recently with Serbia, one as recently as 1913."
Social Studies,"They were eager to capture back some territory so in 1915 the Bulgarians joined the war on the side of the Central Powers and as we exit 1915, you have a joint offensive between the Bulgarians, the Austro-Hungarians and the Germans against the small country of Serbia and the Germans interest other than the fact that they wanted to support their ally, Austria, they were also eager to take control of the railways between Berlin and Constantinople and that railway went into Serbia and so if they were able to capture this, take Serbia out of the war, then they would be able to send supplies much more easily to their other ally, the Ottoman Empire."
Social Studies,"So on October of 1915, October of 1915, you have a joint offensive between the German army and this is what this map right here is depicting right over here. This is the third Austrian army, this is the 11th German army. This is the first Bulgarian army, this is the second Bulgarian army and their joint offensive is hugely successful for the Central Powers. They're essentially able to roll into Serbia."
Social Studies,"It's actually impressive on the side of the Serbians that it took this much force to be able to roll through Serbia, but they were able to roll through Serbia, essentially occupy all of Serbia."
Social Studies,"They put the Serbian army on the run and the only redeeming thing for the Serbians is that some element of the Serbian army was actually able to escape through Montenegro and Albania and some of the civilians and then they were transported by the allies, by the entente, to be able to recuperate and then join as we'll see on the Macedonian front. So 1915 you have the Central Powers roll through Serbia so to any observer right now, Serbia is essentially lost."
Social Studies,"Now right when that was happening, the allies had recognized that Serbia was in a very difficult situation and as we got to the end of 1915, they did start... The French and British troops did start to land in Salonica right over here in order to, one would think, help the Serbian forces. Now they weren't able to arrive and act in enough time to prevent what happened in October of 1915."
Social Studies,"You have some French forces that were able to essentially distract the Bulgarian second army that aided to some degree the Serbian retreat, but essentially they started to build their own forces right over here in Salonica. Now this is interesting because we're talking about this region right over here, kind of Macedonia and Greece and at this point in the war, Greece had stayed neutral. The king was leaning towards..."
Social Studies,"King Constantine the first, he was leaning towards the Central Powers while the prime minister and I'm sure I'm going to say this incorrectly, Venizelos, he was leaning toward the ally parties so you started to have this kind of disconnect between the two and the prime minister resigns, but he has active support, especially in kind of Macedonia and Greece and obviously he has support amongst the allies."
Social Studies,"So as you go into 1916, you have a coup for Venizelos in Macedonia and Greece, especially in around Salonica, which is essentially being held by the allies, even though Greece is essentially... Is officially neutral. So coup for Venizelos, which leads to a very interesting situation."
Social Studies,"So after the coup for Venizelos, you essentially have Greece, kind of Macedonian and Greece is under the control of the supporters of Venizelos and supporters of the allies while the rest of Greece is still loyal to the king and the king is leaning towards the Central Powers, but it's not really clear what he wants to do about it. Then you get into 1917, the allies start to get a little bit forceful about it. In 1917 they have a blockade. They apply a blockade of southern Greece."
Social Studies,"Obviously blockades are always inflict a lot of hardship, economic hardship, human hardship, on civilians, but this essentially forces in June of 1917 Constantine the first... Constantine goes into exhile and essentially at this point, all of Greece is under..."
Social Studies,"Is kind of supporting the allies and Greece goes on the side of the allies so in this map right over here that shows kind of the Allied Powers, the entente powers and the Central Powers, Greece right over here is depicted as an Allied Power, but it was officially neutral as we go through 1917 only after the overthrow as... Only after Constantine the first goes into exile, do we have Greece formally becoming an ally. And so that set gives us the set up into 1918."
Social Studies,"So you had regrouped Serbian forces and at this point , it would be called the Macedonian front. Serbia has been lost to the Central Powers. You have regrouped Serbian forces at Salonica. They've been transported to Salonica and in Greek Macedonian general. You now have the Greek army who is now on the side of the allies."
Social Studies,"You have the British and the French army and so as we get into September 1918, they are ready to go on the offensive and you need to remember what's happening in the rest of Europe at this point. You might remember August 1918, this is the beginning of the 100 days offensive that marked the allied victory on the western front so news was already getting in there."
Social Studies,"You had great morale amongst the allies, you had not so great morale amongst the Central Powers and so in 1918, September, you have the allied offensive coming out of Greece, coming out of I guess you could call it Macedonian Greece. Hugely successful."
Social Studies,"They were able to retake Serbia and actually some of the British forces are able to go east and retake Constantinople and so this part, this Macedonian front, is part of this overall we saw on the western front, kind of the end to the Central Powers ambitions in World War I and it ends with an armistice on this front and as we know, as we get into November of 1918, you have essentially armistices or cease fires on all the major fronts and the allies have essentially won.."
Social Studies,"And they were able to roll through in 1915. And then we wait until 1918 for the Allies to essentially recapture Serbia. Now what is noteworthy-- there's many noteworthy things in World War I and obviously we can't cover all of them-- is just what a huge loss World War I was to the Serbian people. Just as a little bit of context, very small country-- we're talking 4.5 million people as we enter into World War I-- with a reasonably, I guess relative to the size of the country, it was a decent-sized army."
Social Studies,"But with an army we're talking on the order of 400,000 soldiers. And this was pretty much everyone in the country who could be in the army was essentially in the army. Over the course of the Serbian campaign and the Macedonian front, you essentially have the Serbian army getting decimated. You have 60% of the Serbian army dies. Roughly 60% of the Serbian army is killed. And even from a population point of view, the Serbian population is reduced by 16%."
Social Studies,"16% of the Serbian population, civilian and military, is dead by the end of World War I. So a lot of countries suffered horribly during World War I. There's many notable ones, France, the Russian Empire. We could go on and on and on. But it would be hard to argue that any country suffered more than what the Serbians did. 60% of their military dead, 16% of their population.."
Social Studies,"Despite being part of that defensive pact, that they would defend each other if any of these other parties like Russia were to attack them, or France were to attack them, it was an awkward alliance because Italy was a historical enemy of Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary had some territory, especially some territory where some Italian speakers were. Some Italian nationalists were interested in recapturing or having claims on some of that territory. I've circled some of that right over here."
Social Studies,"Right from the get-go it was an awkward alliance. Even in that first Triple Alliance, Italy got an exception for this defensive alliance. It says we don't want to be at war with Great Britain. Then in 1902, Italy gets into another secret ... or I guess this is the first of many secret deals ... with France. If you've ever played Diplomacy, this is what Diplomacy's all about. You make a deal with one person, but maybe in secret you're making exceptions with other people."
Social Studies,"They get into a secret pact with France where Italy's essentially saying, ""Look, you know, even though we're a member of this Triple Alliance and we've already said we're not going to be at war with Great Britain, we're also going to say that for France as well."
Social Studies,"We're really not in a mood to be at war with you."" Then when you fast forward to 1914, and we're now at the beginning of World War I, August, Germany declares, July, Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia, Russia begins to mobilize, Germany declares war on Russia and on France, Italy, because of this kind of awkwardness in this Triple Alliance, actually decides to stay neutral. Italy stays neutral. Their justification for staying neutral is that the Triple Alliance is a defensive pact."
Social Studies,"It says, ""Hey, we're going to defend each other if anyone attacks us,"" but they're saying that in 1914 at the beginning of World War I it was Austria-Hungary that decided to take the offensive. It was Germany that took the offensive, just based on mobilization in Russia, that took the offensive against France and in terms of declaring war on Russia. So Italy says, ""Hey, look, this is a defensive pact. The other two members of the Triple Alliance, they're being offensive. We don't want ..."
Social Studies,"That means that we aren't bound to it. We're only bound to it in the event of defense. As you can imagine, a lot of it was them just trying to figure out who's likely to win this, in which scenario are they likely to gain the most. So you fast forward to 1915, in particular April 26. The Italians are negotiating with the allies thinking about what type of territory they could capture especially from Austria-Hungary. On April 26 they sign the Treaty of London, which at this point is a secret."
Social Studies,"Treaty of London. It's not broadcast to the other members of the Triple Alliance, but it's an agreement with the triple entente that hey, look, we are on your side. We are going to declare war on the central powers imminently. They do so in May 1915, on May 3. They back out of the Triple Alliance ... out of Triple Alliance ... out of Triple Alliance. Then on May 23 they declare war on their historical enemy, but one of the co-signers of the Triple Alliance declare war on the Austro-Hungarian empire."
Social Studies,"On the Austro-Hungarian empire. As we'll see, this was actually, Italy's entering into the war on the side of the allies against Austria-Hungary, actually played a major role in the eventual downfall of the Austro-Hungarians and I'll go into that into more detail in the next video.."
Social Studies,"Then in May, it actually declares war on Austria-Hungary. It actually wouldn't formally declare war on Germany until 1916. And so that lays the setting for the actual combat along the Italian Austro-Hungarian border that they share right over here. And so this next map I'm going to show you is essentially a zoom in of this part of this map. So that's this map right over here. So we can start in 1915. So we're going to start right over here in 1915. We already saw that in May Italy declares war on Austria."
Social Studies,"They didn't war on Germany until the next year. The first combat happens in June with the first Battle on the Isanzo River. I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it. The Isanzo River contours the then border between Italy and the Austro-Hungarian empire. So it goes right along this area right over here. It's actually a very mountainous region. And as we'll see, the Italian front involved many, many battles along the Isanzo River, in fact, 12 battles in all. June 1915, it was the first battle."
Social Studies,"And these continue into 1916. We get all the way until the Fifth Battle of the Isanzo River. So actually, let me draw that arrow a little bit longer. These continue all the way into 1916. And these essentially end up in a stalemate. A lot of people die in these battles. It's incredibly difficult terrain. It favors the defending forces. And so, nothing really happens to the border here. So far, all the offenses that the Italians had taken, nothing really happened."
Social Studies,"Then, as we get into May of 1916, the Austro-Hungarians decide to go on the offensive. And they go on the offensive in this part of the border right over here. And their offensive is called the Battle of Asiago, which is right over here. They are able to get as far as Asiago. But once again, even though they were able to claim some ground, they weren't able to keep the ground. There were spreading their troops out. They weren't able to maintain their supply chain, their supply lines."
Social Studies,"So by the end of that battle, the Italians had reclaimed that territory. And the actual front had not moved dramatically. So really the first two years of the conflict ended up in a bit of stalemate. In fact, it continues. We then to pick up in 1916 the Sixth Battle on the Isanzo River. And then these battles on the Isanzo River continue into 1917. So let me show you. These are the battles on the Isanzo River. These continue all the way into 1917."
Social Studies,"Now, as we enter into 1917, several interesting things are happening. One, as you might remember, on the Eastern Front in 1917, the Russians are starting to fall apart. They are starting to have revolutions at home. They're losing on Eastern Front. This allows the Germans to redeploy some troops. Also, at this point, Italy is formally at war with the Germans. So as we get to October of 1917, the Austro-Hungarians are able to get reinforced by the Germans. And it was just in time."
Social Studies,"Because frankly, by the 11th Battle of the Isanzo River in late 1917, the Austro-Hungarians aren't quite sure whether they can handle a 12th Battle on the Isanzo River. So the Germans essentially show up just in time. In October of 1917, along with the Austro-Hungarians, the Germans then launch their own offensive on the Isanzo River. And this one is actually the first dramatic movement that we see along the Italian front. And this is often called the Battle of Caporetto, which is right over here."
Social Studies,"But as you could imagine, it's right along the border between these two states and it's along the Isanzo River, so this is also referred to as the 12th Battle of the Isanzo River. And this one is a very successful offensive. They focused their troops near Caporetto at this point of the front. They're able to break the Italian front. And then push deep into Italian territory."
Social Studies,"So through October and early November, they're able to, over the next several weeks-- this is in October, November 1917-- they're able to push the Italians all the way back to behind it the Piave River, so this right over here. You may or may not be able to read it. That says the Piave River. So they're able to push the Italians roughly back to this boundary right over here. And so this takes us into 1918. Now at this point, the Germans are planning their last ditch spring offensive."
Social Studies,"They say, hey, look Austro-Hungarians, it looks like this war is taken. We're going to leave this front to you guys. You guys should be able to do the knock out blow on the Italians right now. We're going to go return to the Western Front, so that we can take care of the Allies, especially because if we don't do it sooner than later the Americans are going to be able to reinforce the Western Front. So the Germans redeploy to Western Front, away from this front."
Social Studies,"And essentially leave the Austro-Hungarians to try to essentially take out the Italians. And so in June 1918, the Austro-Hungarians attempt their final-- what they hope is their final-- offensive. And its along this boundary right here on the Piave River. Unfortunately for the Austro-Hungarians, and fortunately for the Italians, the Austro-Hungarians did not plan that assault well."
Social Studies,"Instead of doing a point offensive like they did with the Germans in the Battle of Caporetto, where they were able to break the trenches, break the lines, here it was less planned, less coordinated. It was more spread out along the entire line. On top of everything, the Italians got word of the exact time and date that the battle was going to start. It was literally going to start 3:00 AM on June 15."
Social Studies,"The Italians decide, well, it the battle's going to start at 3:00 AM on June 15, that means that all of their soldiers are going to be in the trenches ready to attack at 3:00 AM on June 15. So they started lobbing artillery into these densely packed trenches knowing that it was likely to hit a lot of people because there were a lot of people who were waiting in the trenches for an offensive."
Social Studies,"And so even before the battle began, they were able to inflict a lot of carnage on the soon to be invading Austro-Hungarians. The invasion itself was a bit of a debacle. When they were able to get on top of the Piave River, it isolated their troops. The Italians were able to take advantage of that. And those troops that were isolated the south bank of the Piave River, they were able to take care of them. And they were able to push the Austro-Hungarians back. And they secured huge losses."
Social Studies,"The Austro-Hungarian army was incredibly weakened. And some people believe that the Italians could have just done an immediate counter offensive and taken the Austro-Hungarians out. The Italians, on the other hand, they were still licking their wounds from the Battle of Caporetto and they decided to wait their chance and regroup a bit. And so they wait until October of 1918. You have a very weakened Austro-Hungarian army."
Social Studies,"And this is when the Italians do their decisive offensive of the Italian front, the Battle of the Vittorio Venito. Vittorio Venito is right over here. And once again, I apologize to all of the Italians out there for my mispronunciations. But this is what's essentially able to break the back of the Austrians. The Italians are able to pour through. They're able to, essentially, take out the Austrians. The Austrians were already weakened. They're starting to have internal strife."
Social Studies,"The empire is starting to fall apart. And so by November, the Austro-Hungarian empire essentially surrenders. And not just with the Italians, but surrenders relative to the Allies, which is essentially the end of the Italian front of World War I.."
Social Studies,"And so Japan proceeded to do this. In particular, it took a siege of Tsingtao, which we already talked about, was a German possession. These are Japanese boats landing there, Japanese troops. And this was actually of technological significance. It was the first time that you had a naval-based aerial assault. This wasn't really using what we would consider aircraft carriers, although they did carry the aircraft."
Social Studies,"But they would place them into the water, and then the aircraft would take off from the water as they tried to take the town of Tsingtao, which they were eventually able to do by the end of 1914. On top of that, they were able to take control of many of Germany's other possessions in the Pacific, specifically the Pacific Islands. And on top of that, Japan did send some aspects, or some parts of its navy, to help protect Allied fleets as far away as the Mediterranean. So Japan did play a role here."
Social Studies,"The other interesting historical note, because of Japan's involvement in World War I, is what came out of the negotiations. First of all, by being involved, it kind of put Japan at the seat of major powers. And as we'll see, in World War II, Japan ends up being one of the major players in World War II, and it's essentially going on the other side by that point. But because of its help of the Allies, Japan does have a seat at the table at the Paris Peace Conference."
Social Studies,"And as they are negotiating the Treaty of Versailles and coming up with the League of Nations, Japan is eager to kind of have an equal footing with all of the other European powers. And so it attempts to place this in the charter for the League of Nations."
Social Studies,"""The equality of nations being a basic principle of the League of Nations, the High Contracting Parties agree to accord as soon as possible to all alien nationals of states, members of the League, equal and just treatment in every respect""-- let me underline that-- ""equal and just treatment in every respect, making no distinction either in law or in fact, on account of their race or nationality."" Essentially the Japanese were saying, hey, look, you Europeans, you guys have to view us and-- based on the way this is phrased-- other people as equals."
Social Studies,"Just to get a sense of what the world was like then, this was not passed. Even though the League of Nations was the product of these very idealistic thoughts by Woodrow Wilson, it did not get passed. Obviously the British, they had subjugated many people in their empires. Woodrow Wilson was afraid that if this were to be included in the League of Nations, it would have trouble passing-- getting ratified in the segregated South. We now know later that the League of Nations wasn't ratified anyway."
Social Studies,"And so this essentially does not happen. And even the Japanese themselves, they were eager for equality for themselves. But as we'll see as we enter into World War II, they themselves had a sense of racial superiority and they subjugated many of the other people in Asia, especially the Chinese and the Koreans. This is an interesting quote from the Chinese delegation."
Social Studies,"""We are not too proud to fight but we are too proud to accept a place of admitted inferiority in dealing with one or more of the associated nations. We want nothing but simple justice."" So it tells you how different the world was. This is not even 100 years ago. And the real relevance of World War I for Japan was it elevated it to becoming one of the powers of the world.."
Social Studies,"They were able to capture some very valuable territory from France, in particular Alsace and Lorraine, which is very mineral rich. And so the Germans were plotting too, well, what are we going to do if we get into another war with them? At the same time, once France and Russia had this alliance, Germany fully recognized if there is a war with France, it's likely to not be just with France. It's likely to be a two front war. On the Western Front, they'll be in conflict with France."
Social Studies,"And on the Eastern Front, they'll be in conflict with Russia. And so to deal with this eventuality-- this is all the scheming that Germany did in the decades going up to World War I-- they came up with the Schlieffen Plan. And I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it. Named for Alfred von Schlieffen, he was chief of the German Empire's general staff from 1891 to 1905. And it was based on how do you deal with a two front war? And the general ides here were that Russia had a large and almost inexhaustible army."
Social Studies,"But because it was so large it would take a long time for it to mobilize. And the Germans are actually able to approximate it correctly because this is how long it did take the Russians to mobilize at the beginning of World War I. They estimated that it would take them about six weeks. So the Schlieffen Plan called for enough German troops on the Eastern Front, initially, in order to keep the Russians at bay."
Social Studies,"But then the main fighting force of the Germans, while the Russians are mobilizing, is to go after France and try to essentially knock France out of commission, so that they're not facing a two front war anymore. And then have those troops go back to fight against the Russians. And the way that they wanted to do it is by rolling through Belgium in a wheel like pattern like this."
Social Studies,"And the reason why they wanted to do this wheel like pattern is that they correctly predicted that the French were very eager to get this territory right over here. And the French actually had a plan-- they called it Plan 17- for going after Alsace and Lorraine. It was an offensive plan. And the view is if the French army is going in that direction, if the German army rolls through Belgium and is able to get them from the rear, they could put the French army out of commission."
Social Studies,"So in early August 1914, the Germans, once they declared war on France and on Russia, the Germans tried to put the Schlieffen Plan into action. And they frankly, almost succeeded. So through August and early September, the Germans were able to essentially roll through Belgium and keep the combined, mainly French forces, but there was also some assistance from British, to keep them on their heels."
Social Studies,"And this happened all the way until early September when they get near the Marne, or a little bit past the Marne River in France. And it was here that the Sixth French Army-- and when we talk about armies we're talking about huge numbers of troops. The Sixth French Army had over 200,000 troops in it. When we're talking about the Battle of the Marne-- which I'm about to talk to you. We're talking about the first Battle of the Marne. We're talking about a battle that involves two million troops."
Social Studies,"So these are battles that are occurring on an epic scale. Just each of these armies-- this army or this one, or even the German armies-- we're talking about tens to hundreds of thousands of troops. In general, an army characterize you're talking about over 50,000, 60,000 troops. So what happens as you go to early September, especially September 5, 1914, the Sixth French Army recognizes a mistake that the First German Army made. By trying to roll around like this, they exposed their right flank."
Social Studies,"So right over here would be the right flank of the German army. And just as most mammals, our flanks are our weak spot, that area between your ribs and your hips, the same thing is true for armies. The front of the army tends to be where you have the strongest forces. And then you have your supply routes going back. So if you can outflank an army-- and that's what a lot of military strategy is designed around-- you can hit an army in its weaker points."
Social Studies,"So by September 5, the First German Army recognized this, but it was too late. By September 6, they were essentially being confronted by the Sixth French Army. And by essentially turning to meet them they created an opening between them and the Second German And that opening was able-- the French and the British were able to take advantage of that to essentially put the Germans on their heels after a month of advancing. And so right over here, you have the various French armies."
Social Studies,"And they were assisted by the British expeditionary force. And so from the Battle of the Marne, which was essentially, most historians would say, between September 6, or September 5, September 6 and September 12, they were able to put the Germans on the retreat. The Germans retreated past the Aisne River. And then once you get into November and the end of the year of 1914, the Germans essentially entrenched themselves."
Social Studies,"They were literally building deep trenches in northern France and a little bit of western Belgium. And what I have right over here-- let me see if I can draw it. What I have right over here, what the boundaries are eventually happened after the Germans suffered, essentially, their first big defeat. They had to retreat and they had to literally retrench. And this is what the borders would then be like. And these were literally trenches getting dug here. This first stage of the war was hugely dynamic."
Social Studies,"You had armies moving fairly rapidly over a period of weeks and months. But then once the Germans retrenched, you have roughly this position being static for the next three years and the famous trench warfare of the Western front that you might have seen movies on. And I want to emphasize this was a big deal."
Social Studies,"The first Battle of the Marne-- sometimes it's called the Miracle of the Marne-- if the French, with British help, were not able to push the Germans back, they might have accomplished the Schlieffen Plan and actually maybe would have won World War I, or at least been able to win the Western front fairly quickly. And then been able to deal with the Russians a little bit better. But because of the Miracle at the Marne-- which was hugely bloody. We're talking about 500,000 casualties on both sides."
Social Studies,"We're talking 100,000 to 200,000 dead on both sides. But because of that, that was able to hold off the Germans. But it got the Western front into this ugly three year long trench warfare.."
Social Studies,"The Eastern Front was essentially this entire region right over there. And because of that, trench warfare did not become as major of a factor on the Eastern Front. In fact, was fairly useless on the Eastern Front. If you imagine trying to dig a bunch of trenches. So if you're trying to dig a bunch of trenches, trenches are huge advantage for the defending army as long as you can block off the entire region with trenches."
Social Studies,"So over here, you can't go around the trenches, you essentially, if you want to make some ground, an attacking army has to cross the trenches. And because you have now machine guns and the defending soldiers could essentially sit behind the trenches, they could essentially mow down the attacking army very easily. And that's what caused the Western Front, especially after the Schlieffen Plan was not able to be executed on as quickly as possible, it turned into just a stalemate."
Social Studies,"So you just had a stalemate, a hugely defensive stalemate. Because both parties had their trenches, it was very, it was hugely advantageous for the defending side. On the Eastern Front, you had this huge front. It was very hard. You couldn't have. They didn't have enough people to dig trenches across this entire front. And so you could imagine if you tried to dig a trench, but you weren't able to cover the entire front, then the attacking army doesn't have to storm your trench."
Social Studies,"They don't have to do that anymore. They could just go around your trench. And because trench warfare was not as significant of a factor on the, or wasn't as anywhere near as much of a factor on the Eastern Front, it was a much more fluid front. You had offensives and counter-offensives between the Germans, Austrians on one side and the Russians on the other. Now the other factor-- and this was mainly with Russia as a variable-- the other factor was just what was going on in Russia."
Social Studies,"So Russia had several things going for it. The main thing is, it had a huge army. It had a huge standing army, even before the war. And it was able to amass even more. So it had a huge army. But what was going against it-- and this is why it eventually had to get into a very unfavorable treaty with the Central Powers near the end of the war-- is it had huge internal problems. And I'm not just talking about the military. I was talking about, I'm talking about the entire empire."
Social Studies,"And it arguably was due to the war, due to the economic and the human cost of the war. But as we enter into 1917, you first have the February Revolution. Tsar Nicholas II has to abdicate the throne because of the riots that are going on, because of the unhappiness, the unease with people literally going hungry. People, obviously, the morale of the troops going down."
Social Studies,"And then on top of that, the Russian military, even though it had a huge army in the beginning of the war, the Russian industry wasn't ready to fully supply that army in as good of a way as, say, the German army was. And on top of that, it had communication problems. And even in the beginning phases of the Eastern Front, it even had issues in terms of coordinating its actual armies. And so what we'll see, and we'll cover this in much more depth in a future video, but what we'll see is, Western Front."
Social Studies,"Schlieffen Plan not executed as fast as possible. Ends up in a stalemate. This did allow the Germans to bring some of their troops back to the Eastern Front to fight the Russians. This goes back and forth as we'll see. But once you enter into 1917, you have a revolution in Russia. First, you have the February Revolution. Tsar Nicholas II has to abdicate. And then later that year, you have the Bolsheviks overthrow the interim government. And you now have Communist Russia."
Social Studies,"The Bolsheviks were in no mood to continue to fight the Germans. The military was in no mood to continue to fight the Germans and the and Austria-Hungary. And so they, essentially, get into a treaty with them and kind of take themselves out of the war. So we'll cover that in a little bit more detail in a future video.."
Social Studies,"The Germans have an alliance with the Austrians. So they feel the need to fight the Russians. And then, because the Russians have an alliance with the French, to fight the French as well. The first actual combat on the Eastern Front actually happens with Russia on the offensive. And you actually have two Russian armies. The Russian First Army and the Russian Second Army attacking the Germans up here in Eastern Prussia."
Social Studies,"And they were going against one German army, the German Eighth And in theory, it should have been a route of the German Eighth Army. They had them outnumbered. You had two Russian armies coming from different directions. But because of really bad coordination and, one could even argue, bad leadership and other tactical problems, it was actually a route the other way. So the war, World War I, on the Eastern Front, starts very badly for the Russians."
Social Studies,"You actually have a huge route of them at the Battle of Tannenberg. And Tannenberg's interesting because it actually did not even happen in Tannenberg. Tannenberg is right around here. It wasn't far from the point of the battle. But there was other cities that would have been more, the battle could have been named for."
Social Studies,"But since the Germans won the battle, they named it Tannenberg because there was an ancient battle in medieval times in the 1400s where the Slavic, some Slavic peoples were able to route German Teutonic knights. We're talking about medieval battles with knights. And in order to redeem that, they labeled this other war where it was Germans against Slavic people. They said, oh, this is our second battle for Tannenberg. So it helped bring out more German patriotism."
Social Studies,"But this was a major, major, major route for the Russians. The Second Army, in particular, got completely decimated. The Second Army, the Russian Second Army went into the battle-- I've seen estimates of 150,000 to 180,000 troops. Roughly half were killed. And only about 10,000 escaped the Battle of Tannenberg."
Social Studies,"And it was such a humiliating defeat for the Russian Second But that the general of the Russian Second Army, General Samsonov-- and I'm sure once again, I'm mispronouncing everything-- General Samsonov actually shot himself. He committed suicide. He was so humiliated and so embarrassed by that defeat. So the war did not begin well for the Russians. But by the end of 1914, they were able to get back into gear. And they stayed on the offensive."
Social Studies,"And they did have some victories up here in Galicia which, at the time, was part of northeastern Hungary. And so they were actually able to capture a good bit of territory right over here. Now, as we enter into 1915, and we've already covered this on the videos on the Western Front. We know that the Western Front was entering into a stalemate. The Schlieffen Plan did not happen as quickly as possible. But the defenders had a huge advantage."
Social Studies,"So that gave the Germans an opportunity to bring some troops back to the Eastern Front, to bring troops back to the Eastern Front. They also got better at coordinating with the Austro-Hungarians. And so you have 1915, you have the Central Powers go back on the offensive. And they're essentially able to drive the Russians out of Russian Poland roughly to this border that I have drawn right over here, roughly to this border, give or take, right over here."
Social Studies,"When we talk about Russian Poland, the modern state of Poland, I'm making this video now in 2013. The modern state of Poland was essentially split between what you see on this map between the Russian Empire and the German Empire. The modern state of Poland is roughly this region right over here. And so you see, it's almost completely split, almost like a yin and yang symbol between these two empires. But by, but through 1915, the Russians were pushed out of Russian Poland roughly to this border."
Social Studies,"And essentially, to a large degree, it was because Russia, even though they had this huge army, this huge manpower, they had bad communication lines. And actually had bad technical supplies. Russian industry wasn't able to keep up with the demand of the war and wasn't able to supply the munitions in proper quantities and the arms in proper quantities to their troops. As you enter into 1916, the Russians, once again, were able to get their footing back."
Social Studies,"As you can see, it's starting to become a little bit of a back and forth. So Russian industry, I guess you could say, picks back up in 1916. And it essentially puts the Russians more on the offensive. They were driven out of Russian Poland. But now by 1916, they're able to keep the Central Powers a little bit more on the defensive. But the boundaries of the front roughly stay in line with this line right over here."
Social Studies,"And by the end of 1916, you actually have the Romanians joining on the side of the Triple Entente, on the sides of the Russians, in order to fight the Central Powers as well. Now, this might look like it's starting to look better for the Russians. The Russians, their industry is finally picking up. They're starting to put the Central Powers a little bit more on the defensive."
Social Studies,"But the entire time that we're talking about this battle, the economic situation in the Russian Empire is deteriorating dramatically. By the time you get into 1917, the Russian economy is really falling apart. You have food shortages. You have riots. Food shortages. You have riots. And in February of 1917, you have the February Revolution. You essentially, the overthrow of the Romanov Dynasty. It's been in power for 300 years. But you have Tsar Nicholas II. So this is in February."
Social Studies,"And then in early March, you have Tsar Nicholas II abdicates the throne. And this is the gentleman right here. And we'll do more detailed videos about the entire Russian Revolution and what happens to his family and all of the rest. And you have an interim government that takes place. And this is actually a little, this is an interesting fact of history. This interim government all of a sudden becomes a democracy. This is February 1917. Remember, the United States has not entered the war at this point."
Social Studies,"But you might also remember that in April, the United States uses the idea of fighting on the side of democracy as a justification for entering the war. Which is very nice, because by April, all of the major powers on the side of the, I guess you would say, the Triple Entente, they were all democracies. You're talking about, now, the interim government for the Russians. You have the French. And you have the British Empire. Obviously, it's a democracy only for those who are voting."
Social Studies,"And actually the United States was the first country to recognize the interim government after the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II. But we're not just done with 1917. 1917 is one of those huge years in the history of the world and especially in the history of Russia. The situation continues to deteriorate. And it starts to deteriorate, as well, for the army. The morale and the troops breakdown. You start having, the Bolsheviks start to create unrest."
Social Studies,"By the end of 1917, now we're talking about September 1917. So that's maybe right around here. You have the Central Powers. Germany's able to capture Riga, which is a major city right over here on the Baltic. Which brings the Central Powers very, very close to the Russian capital. It contributes to the ongoing unrest that's going on. And so in November 7, you have coup d'etat of that ostensibly democratic interim government, provisional government. And you have the communists take power."
Social Studies,"You have the Bolsheviks take power under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin right over here. So November 7, 1917, very famous date in history. You have the Bolsheviks. So this is Lenin leading the Bolsheviks into power. Now, they were in no interest to continue fighting this battle with Germany. They had their own civil war to worry about. They were trying to consolidate power in Russia. So in December, they essentially get into, start to negotiate an armistice with the Central Powers."
Social Studies,"And they did not have a lot of leverage in this negotiation because they weren't, they really did not want to be in this war. And so by March of 1918, you have the treaty-- this between Russia and the Central Powers-- the Treaty of Brest-- and I'm sure I'm mispronouncing everything-- Brest-Litovsk."
Social Studies,"The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, in which the Russians, because they were so desperate, the Bolsheviks were so desperate in order to get, to focus on the internal civil war that had emerged in Russia, in order to consolidate power, they gave over a huge amount of territory to the Central Powers. And essentially a large part of European Russia that is not predominantly-- of Russian ethnicity went over to the Central Powers."
Social Studies,"Now this treaty is important because it essentially was the end of World War I for the Russians. It essentially was the end of the Eastern Front. And it allowed the Germans to then refocus on the Western Front, which allowed the Germans to start bringing troops back over to the Western Front. And they were actually able to do quite an aggressive Spring Offensive on the Western Front."
Social Studies,"And if it wasn't for the US at the time, now being able to reinforce the Western Front-- remember, they declared war in mid-1917-- it's not clear that the German offensive might not have been successful in the spring of 1918. So the importance of Brest-Litovsk is it was the end of the Eastern Front. It allowed the Germans to do an offensive on the Western Front. And it was a very strong offensive. But with the help of the Americans, it was not a successful one."
Social Studies,"But the actual territorial gains for the Central Power of Brest-Litovsk-- I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it-- were not that significant. Because in November 1918-- and here I'm probably falling off my timeline a little bit. But right over here in November 1918, this is maybe 19-- this is 1919 right over here. You have the Central Powers essentially saying, oh my God, we're not going to be able to win this war. And you have the, essentially, what was for a long time known as Armistice Day."
Social Studies,"The 11th the day of the 11th month-- or the 11th hour of the 11th month-- or the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, you have an armistice. And you have the end of World War I with the Allies winning. And so the Allies got to say what happened to this territory right over here.."
Social Studies,"That's not to say that it was not incredibly bloody. In fact, it was so bloody that some of the most famous battles, not just in World War I history, but in world history, occurred during this period. And in particular, they occurred in 1916. In 1916, the first of these happened in February, where you have the Battle of Verdun, or ""Ver-done""."
Social Studies,"Battle of Verdun, where you have the Germans, who want to do an offensive on the French that most historians believe was intended not to necessarily gain this territory, but to try to make the French put so many troops here and inflict so many casualties on the French that they might not be able to overcome that. And they might have to throw the French out of the war."
Social Studies,"And they especially thought this part of the front was vulnerable because the French could be attacked from multiple sides, this little bulge right over here. And so in February of 1916, they attack primarily with artillery. So they're shelling the French right over here, this whole area. The French keep bringing troops into the mix."
Social Studies,"And to get a sense of how ugly and how scary this whole scene was, this is a quote from the journal of a French soldier who was serving in Verdun during the Battle of Verdun, or serving in the Battle of Verdun. And he wrote-- and he was unfortunately later killed due to artillery fire-- ""Humanity is mad. It must be mad to do what it is doing. What a massacre. What scenes of horror and carnage. I cannot find words to translate my impressions. Hell cannot be so terrible."
Social Studies,"Men are mad."" And this battle would continue through most of the year. As you go into the summer, that's the maximum of the German offensive. This is some of the territory that they are able to capture. But as you get into the late summer, in July of 1916, the British and the French decide to do an offensive on another part of the front, right over here near the Somme River. So this right over here is the Somme River. So this right over here is the German offensive."
Social Studies,"In July, you have the Battle of the Somme, sometimes referred to as the Somme Offensive, named after the Somme River. It occurred where the Somme River intersected with the front. And this was an Anglo, British and French, Anglo French offensive. And it's also famous-- both of these were incredibly bloody. That's what really made them noteworthy. But this was also famous for the first use of the tanks. This was a picture of a British tank at the time. But both of these were incredibly bloody."
Social Studies,"It was lucky for the French at Verdun that the offensive at the Somme happened because this forced the Germans to go off of the offensive as we get into the late summer of 1916. They had to bring troops back over here to help support it. But the end result of both of these is you do not have a major movement of the front. In fact, by the end of 1916, because the Germans had to go fight at the Battle of the Somme, the French were able to recapture much of this territory."
Social Studies,"So the real end result of both of these offensives, one on the German side, one on the British side, was just a massive, massive, massive loss of human life. Each of them, it's estimated, had on the order of a million casualties, roughly half on each side. At Verdun, it was slightly more on the French side than the German. But it was roughly 55, 45%. So a million casualties in Verdun. A million casualties on both sides at the Somme."
Social Studies,"I've seen estimates on the death toll being a third of a million to half a million for each of these battles. So both of these were incredibly, incredibly ugly battles for both sides. The end result for the Germans though was even more interesting because you have to remember what was happening at the Eastern Front. On the Eastern Front, 1916 was the year that the Russians finally were building up their war machine. They were finally able to equip the munitions necessary."
Social Studies,"It was also the year that the Romanians joined on side of the Entente along with the Russians on the Eastern Front. The Austro-Hungarians were suffering huge losses. So in 1916 the Germans were in a very tough situation. Huge losses at Verdun, huge losses at the Battle of the Somme, the Russians are starting to get more aggressive on the Eastern Front, the Austro-Hungarians are starting to have trouble. So they decide to essentially re-trench."
Social Studies,"So they're going to start bringing more troops back to the Eastern Front. But in order not to lose too much ground on the Western Front, they essentially try to hold a smaller front. So they back up to this line. This is the line at the end of the Battle of the Somme. The Germans recognize that they can't protect this entire front. They want to protect a shorter front. So they begin preparing to move back right over here. And this line right over here is named after the field marshal of the German army."
Social Studies,"It's called the Hindenburg line. It's no coincidence. It's the same name of the zeppelin that blew up in the late '30s. It was actually named after Field Marshal Hindenburg for whom this line is named. But the Germans do this in order so that they can take more troops to the Eastern Front and hold a shorter line. So by the end of 1916, they start making the preparations for the Hindenburg line. And in February of 1917, they actually move back to the Hindenburg line."
Social Studies,"So this is 1917 February you have the Germans move to the Hindenburg line. So 1916, incredibly, incredibly ugly year. Two million casualties, not a lot of movement of the actual front.."
Social Studies,"You have the Western Front, you have the Western Front right over here, and you had the huge, you had the huge Eastern Front right over here. By 1917, the major conflict on the Eastern Front, especially with Russia, which was the major power there, had come to an end. You had a February Revolution in Russia. The czar had to abdicate the throne. You had a provisional government. Then in November of 1917, the Bolsheviks have a coup, they take over."
Social Studies,"They have no interest in prosecuting World War I, because they have their own civil war to worry about, so they sign an armistice with the Central Powers, by the end of 1917. And then we get into 1918, just let me write all this down, so by the time we get into 1918, they're ready to sign a treaty in March, in March, the Russians sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Litovsk, which cedes over all of this territory to the Germans and takes the Russians out of World War I."
Social Studies,"So I'm not gonna, I've gone into detail in other videos, but a huge amount of territory, and I'm gonna do it very informally right over here. I'll give a rough sense of where that territory was. And the treaty itself, its main significance, 'cause the treaty didn't last, as you might already know, the Central Powers lost World War I, so that treaty was later nullified."
Social Studies,"But the key importance of that treaty, is one, it took Russia out of the war, it allowed the Central Powers, especially Germany, to focus on the Western Front. But the other element of it is, by giving so much territory to the Germans, the Germans couldn't just leave that territory as is. If they wanted any claims to it, they had to devote some of their troops to occupy, or at least attempt to occupy some of it."
Social Studies,"So even though it was a huge opportunity, and the Germans were able to, after the treaty, or even before the treaty, after the armistice, they were able to start bringing many more of the Eastern-Front troops over to the Western Front. They didn't bring over as many as they could have, because they left some to attempt to occupy some of the territory that had been gained on the Eastern Front. But if you view things from a German perspective, at this point, March 1918, you're gonna be feeling pretty good."
Social Studies,"You are holding your own in a two-front war now, and at one point you thought Russia was the major threat there. That threat is gone, you can now focus on a one-front war, maybe you should be able to kind of put the decisive blow against the allies now. And that is how the Germans felt. But they were worried about a couple of things."
Social Studies,"They were worried about the British industrial capacity, and the Allied industrial capacity, that was stronger than the Central Powers, and so the British could produce more tanks and more guns and more weapons, so it was a race against that, and there was also a race against significant American entry."
Social Studies,"Remember, April 1917, Woodrow Wilson gives a speech to Congress, they declare war on the Central Powers, and so the Germans wanna get this thing over with before the Americans have a chance to send in significant number of fresh troops. So in March 1918, not only do you have the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, you also have the beginning of Germany's attempt to deal that decisive blow to the Allies, and it's known as the Spring Offensive. So you have the Spring, the Spring Offensive."
Social Studies,"And the goal of the Spring Offensive was to essentially try to end the war for the Germans. And the goal was to separate the British from the French forces. The British, for the most part, were in control of the line right over here, north of the Salm River, while the French were in control south of it. So the Spring Offensive, especially the first phases of the Spring Offensive, in March 1918, focused on this area, right over here. And at first it was actually very successful."
Social Studies,"They were able to make huge territorial gains, drive through the lines, drive the Allied Powers back. Now, the problem was is that it wasn't a real big strategic gain."
Social Studies,"The Germans were just hoping it would be such a demoralizer, that it would throw at least, maybe the French out of the war, and then maybe they could take care of the British or whatever else, but that didn't happen, and all of a sudden they found themselves with these huge territorial gains, in very short amount of time, they had to supply themselves, and they didn't really quite, and they had spread their troops thin, and so it frankly just let the opportunity arise for the Allies, in August, to lead a counteroffensive."
Social Studies,"And this counteroffensive by the Allies, is referred to as the 100 Days Offensive. It began in August, went roughly into November, so 100 Days, 100 Days Offensive, during which the Allies, between August and November, were able to push the Germans, not only back beyond what they had captured during the Spring Offensive, but all the way well back of the front that was kind of the stalemate line for most of World War I."
Social Studies,"And it was during this 100 Days Offensive, that to most objective observers, it was clear that the Allies would win this war. And it was clear to several of the Central Powers, or those Allied with the Central Powers. As we go into September, as we go into September of 1918, Bulgaria drops itself out of the war, just to remind ourselves where, what we're talking about. So you have Bulgaria right over here. It, Bulgaria, right over here."
Social Studies,"It signs an armistice with the Allies, so, let me just, you have armistice, I'll use a little peace symbol for armistice, that's a, armistice is just the fighting has stopped, you still, in theory, could be at a state of war, so maybe I shouldn't do the peace symbol, I'll just write armistice. Armistice, Armistice, with Bulgaria."
Social Studies,"And this is really starting to tighten the noose around the remaining Central Powers, because this allowed the Allies to gain control of Serbia and of Greece, which essentially tied, removed the last source of food for Austria, Hungary and the German Empire."
Social Studies,"There was already a blockade, the kind of the harsh, British blockade that we've already talked about, up in the North Sea, and so their last source of food was from the south, but now with Bulgaria signing an armistice, and ceding over territory, now the strangle hold was really, was really, really coming into effect."
Social Studies,"Now, by October, and remember, at this point it was reasonably clear, and even by this point, even clear to the German people that the war is pretty much done for, and they're just waiting for their leaders to make it official. So several of the leaders of the German Navy wanted to do this last-ditch, what could easily be considered suicidal, offensive against the British Navy, and as they're planning it and the sailors catch wind of it, they mutiny, they revolt. They say hey, look, the war is over."
Social Studies,"We're not gonna die in a futile attempt to just kind of, for pride or whatever else, and so you have a naval mutiny begins. Naval mutiny, and eventually this spreads to the mainland and leads to revolts and revolutions, so revolution in Germany, in Germany. And this culminates in November, in November, November 9th, famous date in history, November 9th, 1918."
Social Studies,"You essentially, Kaiser Wilhelm II, right over here, let me make sure you see his picture, this is him right over here, Kaiser Wilhelm II, is forced to abdicate, give up his throne. He flees to the Netherlands, and on November 9th, 1918, Germany is declared a republic. So Germany no longer has a king or emperor in charge. Germany becomes a republic."
Social Studies,"And a little bit before this, November 3rd, the writing was already clear to the Austrians, in fact, they even, in 1917, attempted to make some peace overtures, thinking that they were pretty much done for, but by November 3rd, 1918, the Austrians also signed an armistice, armistice, armistice, with the Austrians, with the Austrians, and with the Kaiser Wilhelm II fleeing to the Netherlands, Germany becoming a republic, this sets up the armistice, finally, with Germany on November 11th, and this is one of the most famous dates in history, known for a long time in the US as Armistice Day, and so it was November 11th, 1918, and it was actually 11am, 11am, so you might remember the famous, the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, war, or World War I, or the fighting in World War I, was over with the Allies victorious, and the Central Powers losing it, and the terms of what would happen for those that lost and those that won would be dictated by the Treaty of Versailles."
Social Studies,"The Treaty of Versailles in 1919. The terms of which were finally finalized about six months later. So this is June, you have the treaty, Treaty of, Treaty of, Treaty of Versailles."
Social Studies,"Which, incidentally, this is like one of those little footnotes in history, the Americans did not actually ratify it, mainly because it had the League of Nations in it, which was this project of Woodrow Wilson, but the American people and the American Congress was not a fan of this whole trans-national government, League of Nations thing, so the United States did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles but in effect, on Armistice Day, November 11th, 11am, the war was over, Treaty of Versailles dictated the terms, many would argue, overly-harsh terms, of the Treaty of Versailles, and we're done with World War I.."
Social Studies,"But it was really the end of the more traditional empires. It was the end of kingdoms. It really reshaped much of the globe much more around states defined by nations rather than states defined by monarchies or states defined by empires. And it was also the first war where technology, or I would say modern technology-- technology has always played a major role in wars. In fact, wars have been a catalyst for technology often."
Social Studies,"But it was the first time that much of what we consider to be modern technology played a huge role in the actual carrying out of the war. And to a large degree, this is what made the war so much bloodier, and one could argue, even more protracted. So here I have a bunch of pictures of the various technologies used in World War I. Here in this picture you have a machine gun, which obviously allows you to indiscriminately mow down folks. These guys, it looks like they might be in some type of a trench."
Social Studies,"And so you could imagine that combination if viewed from above. So let's say that this is a trench. This is a trench right over here. We're looking from above. So there's some people sitting in the trench. A couple of these folks have machine guns. The rest of the guys just have rifles over here. If you wanted to storm this trench, you'd be in a bad situation. The guy with the machine gun essentially could just mow people down. They also tended to use barbed wire."
Social Studies,"Barbed wire wasn't invented in World War I. It was invented many decades before in the 1800s. But that would make it very hard for someone to cross this period. They would get stuck in it. At which point these guys in the trench could shoot him down. And it would be very hard to shoot the guys in the trench. So it also, other than making it very deadly, it gave all the advantages to the defense."
Social Studies,"So any time someone wanted to gain ground, especially in one of the fronts where trench warfare was being used, it was a hugely, hugely, hugely bloody affair. The other technology that came into mainstream use in World War I was the use of gas, and in particular poison gas. And as you see these gentleman right over here, they're wearing gas masks because they're afraid that their opponent is going to use poison gas."
Social Studies,"And the benefit of gas in particular is let's say you have an artillery shell that you throw over and it doesn't hit anybody. But then it starts releasing a canister of-- let me do that in a different color-- it starts releasing a canister of gas. So the gas I've drawn in this purplish color. And so it doesn't have to be a direct hit. It can just linger there and infect that trench. And it'll affect everyone there. And gas warfare was-- actually, the Germans weren't first to use just gas warfare."
Social Studies,"But they were the first to use very lethal, what we would call poison, gas. And in particular in 1915, they used chlorine gas. So let me write that down. Chlorine gas, which immediately attacks the respiratory system of the person who inhales it. And they essentially choke to death within seconds or minutes. They also used phosgene gas because this did not stimulate that choking. And in some ways it could infiltrate the respiratory system even more. It had a delayed effect. So it would linger around."
Social Studies,"And you have the use of mustard gas. Mustard gas was very hard to protect against. It wouldn't immediately have you choke to death like chlorine gas. It would be severe blistering. It would essentially take you out of the battle. It was very hard to protect against. And it would also linger around in the trench. So it made the trench a very toxic environment to work in. So these are very, very, very ugly weapons. I mean, war itself is ugly. Weapons themselves are ugly."
Social Studies,"I mean, the machine gun is not a pleasant weapon. It can mow people down. But even folks who view something like a machine gun as an acceptable thing tend to view these things as particularly ugly things to use. Other weapons that showed up in World War I, we talked about this in other videos, but the tank started to become a factor. This right over here is an American tank. Obviously, with these treads it can go in tough terrain. It's heavily, heavily armored."
Social Studies,"When you talk about this trench type of thing, well, if you've got a big hulking beast, maybe that could roll through the barbed wire and take some beating and maybe eventually-- so you could imagine a tank over here, it could eventually-- and actually the tanks at this time did not have these big turrets. So they might have looked something more like that. But this might be able to actually be part of an offensive against a trench like this. We've talked extensively about submarine warfare in World War I."
Social Studies,"The Germans especially used it, essentially to have a chance against the dominant British Navy. Unrestricted U-boat warfare was one of the primary reasons given by the Americans as to why they entered the war on the side of the entente. These are World War I era US submarines, just to give an idea of how they actually looked. And in some ways the best foreshadowing of what would play a major, major, major role in future wars it was the bringing of heavier than air craft into the war."
Social Studies,"So in particular, we're talking about airplanes. So before this, you had stuff like balloons and zeppelins used for reconnaissance, used to see where we should aim the artillery, things like that. But now you had the Wright brothers only, frankly, several years before inventing the engine powered heavier than air craft. And at first the airplane, in the beginning stages the war, was used for reconnaissance. But as the technology improved, as the engines improved, it started to be used for bombing."
Social Studies,"It started to actually used for air to air combat. And out of all of the folks involved in air to air combat, this gentleman right over here is probably the most famous. Although you might not recognize his name. He's been turned into a bit of a caricature in the modern world. But this is Manfred von Richthofen. And he was a pilot for the Germans. And he's more famously known as the Red Baron. And he was called the Red Baron because he was actually a Baron. It is a title of nobility in imperial Germany."
Social Studies,"And he painted his plane red. So this is a picture of his plane right over here. So if I were to color it in-- I guess this isn't quite red. I should actually probably try to get a more reddish color. So maybe this is more of a red. So this is obviously a black and white photograph, but maybe if I color it in for you, you'll get more of the feeling of what his plane might have looked like. And it was a triplane. It had these three wings right over here, or three levels of wings."
Social Studies,"So whatever, his plane was red. That's why he was called the Red Baron. And he was famous for being the most lethal pilot in all of the war. He has 80 confirmed kills. He was able to down 80 enemy aircraft. So 80 confirmed wins, I guess you can say in combat, which is more than any other folks in World War I. So very, very famous pilot. He himself-- when you're talking about any of the combatants in World War I did not have a long life expectancy. The pilots especially this was a dangerous game."
Social Studies,"And he also, despite being the top pilot, the top ace, amongst all the pilots in World War I, he also ended up getting shot in the air in 1918. He literally got shot through the lungs and the heart. He somehow managed to land his plane. And when the people ran up to him, the accounts say, that his famous last words as he died, right when they ran up to him, was ""kaput"". So interesting. And on top of that, he's now been turned into a bit of a caricature."
Social Studies,"I mean, us in the West, in the US, we recognize the brand Red Baron pizza. It is named for the Red Baron, for Manfred von Richthofen. Kind of a strange name, I think, for a pizza company. I mean, he's not even Italian. But that's, I guess, what we know him for. But you see, this guy right over here looks a lot more like Tom Selleck than look like the real Manfred von Richthofen.."
Social Studies,"And it was in November of 1914 that the British declared the entire North Sea area a war zone. Which essentially is telling any ship, come here at your own risk. You might be destroyed, and especially you're not allowed to carry any contraband. But they included food as a contraband. So this essentially began the blockade of Germany and Austria-Hungary. So this is the blockade of the Central Powers. And this had major implications for the war. It continued throughout the entire war."
Social Studies,"It essentially caused the Germans, or the Central Powers, especially the Germans and the Austrians to have to ration food. We're talking about 1,000 calories a day. You could look at the number of calories in your average Big Mac and think about how little food that was. And there's many estimates of what that caused. That obviously made it hard for the Central Powers to get war munitions and things like that. But it also made it very difficult for them to get food."
Social Studies,"And there are estimates that this rationing, this inability to get food, lead to malnutrition, even led to starvation. And there's estimates that this might have led to in excess of 400,000 civilian deaths either directly or indirectly due to malnutrition or starvation amongst the Central Powers. So this was a pretty serious tactic that was undertaken. Now, the Germans did not have as dominant of a Navy."
Social Studies,"Most of their Navy was actually focused right off of the coast of Germany, right around there, in the North Sea. But they also wanted to disrupt trade with the British. They recognized the British Isles, they're islands. They're dependent on trade for food and for supplies. So in 1915 in February, the Germans declared the seas around the British Isles, they declared this whole area, a war zone. Similarly, they declared that a war zone as well."
Social Studies,"And because their surface fleet was concentrated right over here, the way that they would enforce that, they would essentially try to keep people from trading with the British Isles is through submarine warfare. And World War I is the first time that submarine warfare becomes a significant factor. We're talking about very primitive submarines. But we are talking about these vessels that could go underwater and essentially send torpedoes into boats."
Social Studies,"Now, thinking about that as a backdrop, we now forward to May of 1915. So let's go to May of 1915. You have the passenger liner, the RMS Lusitania. And RMS literally stands for Royal Mail Ship because it carried some mail. It's a big ship. If you've ever seen the movie Titanic, think of a ship like that. And it was setting sail from New York to Liverpool, England. And it was apparently a passenger ship, but it was also carrying cargo."
Social Studies,"But the Germans, they said, look, this could be fair game for us, especially if it's carrying munitions, especially if it's a British ship. And in the advertisement that was in New York for the Lusitania that was going to leave on May 1, 1915, the German embassy actually placed an advertisement. And this is worth reading. They wrote, ""Notice, travelers intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage are reminded that a state of war exists between Germany and her allies and Great Britain and her allies."
Social Studies,"That the zone of war includes the water adjacent to the British Isles. That in accordance with formal notice given by the Imperial German government, vessels flying the flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies, are liable to destruction in those waters. And that travelers sailing in the war zone on ships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk. From the Imperial German embassy."" And this is dated April 1915. So that's the backdrop. The Lusitania sets sail May 1, 1915."
Social Studies,"On May 7, 1915-- the number 15 keeps jumping into my brain-- on May 7, 1915, it's almost reached its destination of Liverpool. That's Liverpool right over here. It's around 10 or 15 miles off the coast of Ireland. And right there it encounters a German U boat. So this right over here is a German U boat. And that German U boat sends a torpedo into the Lusitania. Now the torpedo, as you could imagine, rams into the ship. And then shortly after the torpedo hits, you have this huge explosion."
Social Studies,"And the huge explosion is actually one of those question marks of history. Now, the ship goes down, taking down with it most of its passengers. So there were 1,959 total passengers and crew. And 1,195 of them actually died. Now there were other ships that went down due to German U boats, but what was famous about this one, at least from an American history point of view, is that there were 128 Americans who also died on board."
Social Studies,"And so you could imagine, this led to a lot of people were concerned on the American side. Why did this happen? These were American civilians. And it essentially led to a harsh reprimand from Woodrow Wilson. And just as a little bit of context, once war broke out-- and war had broken not even a year before the sinking of the Lusitania-- the Americans' position was to be neutral. It did not want to enter into this European conflict."
Social Studies,"With that said, the Americans were disproportionately trading with the Allies not the Central Power. They were providing supplies, at a minimum, at a trading level. And they were providing monetary support. They were providing loans to the Allies disproportional to the Central Powers. So even though there was this formal neutrality, there was more implicit connection to the Allies. So Woodrow Wilson, he still wants to keep America out of the war at this point. So we're talking about May 1915."
Social Studies,"And so he essentially just sends a stern warning to the German empire. Says, you must apologize. You must take action to prevent this type of thing happening in the future. And the German empire actually complies. On September 9-- let me write this on the timeline. So right over here. So in May, you have the Lusitania sunk. And then in September, the Germans agree to not attack passenger ships."
Social Studies,"And so even though the sinking of the Lusitania, especially in a lot of American history classes, is often given as a trigger for America entrance into war, this whole thing happened and America stayed neutral throughout this entire period. And America wouldn't actually enter the war until April 1917. So the Lusitania was just one of many things that happened in the years running up to the war."
Social Studies,"And if we fast forward a little bit, in 1916 the next presidential election where Wilson won re-election, he ran on a platform of, he kept us out of war. So the sinking of the Lusitania was a significant event. One could argue because the Germans did not want the US to enter on the side of the Allies, it was why the Germans agreed to loosen up, at least for a couple of years, on their U boat campaigns."
Social Studies,"As we'll see, once we get into 1917, the Germans, out of desperation, start to become more aggressive on their U boat attacks again, which is one of the catalysts that the US claims drove them into World War I. But with that said, just as a little bit of context-- and oftentimes when we look back at history, it seems very cut and dry. It seems obvious. Oh yes, we had to go to war, et cetera, et cetera. I have a few quotes here from William Jennings Bryan, who was Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state."
Social Studies,"And a few of these are pretty telling. So this first one is September 1914. This was before any of the stuff happened with Lusitania, but war had broken out in Europe. And he had this message that he wrote to Woodrow Wilson to essentially advocate why we should stay out of the war and why there should be some type of mediation to try to get the war to end as opposed to just letting it run its course."
Social Studies,"And he wrote to Wilson, ""it is not likely that either side will win so complete a victory as to be able to dictate terms. And if either""-- and this is interesting and strangely foreshadowing-- ""and if either side does win such a victory, it'll probably mean preparation for another war."
Social Studies,"It would seem better to look for a more rational basis for peace."" Now, the other quotes here-- and this is the question mark around that second explosion-- William Jennings Bryan wrote, ""ships carrying contraband should be prohibited from carrying passengers. It would be like putting women and children in front of an army."" And so this is one of those big questions of history. It was known that the Lusitania was carrying light ammunition. So it was carrying a light munitions."
Social Studies,"Now, the Germans claimed that it was actually carrying heavy munitions. And to some degree, that second explosion tends to back that up. And there was all sorts of shady things about a lot of the cargo that the Lusitania was carrying, even though they claimed that it was these perishable goods. It wasn't being stored in a refrigerated part of the ship. And so there was reason to believe that it was carrying actually heavy munitions. And that second explosion seems to point in that direction as well."
Social Studies,"And then even after World War I, the British Navy actually spent multiple times trying to destroy the wreck of the Lusitania. And some people say in order to maybe get rid of some evidence that it was actually carrying far more munitions and maybe was, from the Germans' point of view, a fairer target than was actually made out. So regardless, it's a very interesting incident, not necessarily directly tied to America's entrance into World War I. But it is one of many events."
Social Studies,"And this whole idea of blockades and German U boats against civilians, this was something that was a cause of repeated concern for the Americans.."
Social Studies,"After the sinking of the Lusitania and how angered America had gotten, they said, OK, we're not going to attack passenger vessels anymore. We're only going to attack things that are definitely British, non-passenger vessels. But as we go into January 1917, the British blockade on the Central Powers was having its effect. And the Central Powers were getting desperate, in particular Germany. And so they are eager to essentially do the same to the British."
Social Studies,"Once again, go with the unrestricted submarine warfare. But the Germans knew that if they were to go back to this, that it's likely that the US would enter the war on the side of the Allies. So knowing that was likely to happen. They said, well, how could we slow the US down. And the thinking was, well, maybe we could somehow enlisted the help of Mexico which at the time was not the best terms with the United States."
Social Studies,"And so Arthur Zimmerman who was the German Foreign Secretary, the equivalent of the United States Secretary of State. The Foreign Minister, Arthur Zimmerman sends an encoded a telegram to the Mexicans. And it's encoded, especially because it has to go over lines that are controlled by the Americans. And in it, he actually proposes an alliance to slow the Americans down. So this is what he wrote. So this is a coded telegram."
Social Studies,"And then, it was actually intercepted by British intelligence and decoded and then shared with the Americans, and then that was also then made public to the American public. And so this is why it's fascinating to actually read this stuff. This is January 1917. This is the Germans talking to the Mexicans. ""We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare. We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral."
Social Studies,"In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico a proposal alliance on the following basis-- make war together, make peace together, generous financial support, and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to you. You will inform the President--"" they're talking about the president of Mexico."
Social Studies,"""--of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain and add the suggestion that he should, on his own initiative, invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves. Please call the President's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make peace."
Social Studies,"Signed Zimmerman."" Now, the Mexicans, when they read this, they really didn't take it too seriously. They didn't think that they could seriously engage the US in a war. They couldn't seriously take back or occupy these territories. So they didn't really think much of it. The real effect of this telegram was to make the American public angry. They were going to go back into the unrestricted submarine warfare."
Social Studies,"And the Germans, themselves, talk about ruthless-- ""ruthless employment of our the submarines."" So when people talk about, what were the causes. What brought the US into war? The ones that are typically cited are the unrestricted submarine warfare. The sinking of the Lusitania. The Zimmerman telegram that was trying to get Mexico to somehow get into a war with the US and reclaim these territories."
Social Studies,"And as we'll see, a few months after this, the US actually does declare war on Germany and enter into World War I.."
Social Studies,"And April 4, Congress passes the resolution to declare war. And then the President approves it on April 6. So by early April, the United States was at war with Germany. Which is a good time to start thinking about, why did all of this happen. Now, the things that are typically cited, and these are the things that are inflamed public opinion in the US and that many of which were cited by President Woodrow Wilson."
Social Studies,"And in this tutorial that this is part of on khanacademy.org, I put the entire text of his speech, which I highly recommend reading to see all of the things the President Wilson cited in his speech. But just as a summary of that, the things that tend to get cited most often are the unrestricted submarine warfare on the part of Germany. And particular cases or the most cited example of that is the sinking of the Lusitania. The Germans had stopped doing that for a little under two years."
Social Studies,"But then, as we enter into 1917, they began doing it again. And it also made the Americans quite angry to realize that the Germans were trying to incite the Mexicans against them. So you have the Zimmerman telegram. Zimmerman telegram is also a reason that the Wilson administration, and why people in general, were fairly angry about things. Now, on top of that, there were atrocities committed by the Germans in their march through Belgium as they were trying to execute on the Schlieffen Plan."
Social Studies,"So Belgian atrocities. And these were earlier in the war in 1914, which immediately made many Americans not like what's going on. Belgian atrocities. And to put on top of that, the British were able to leverage the Belgian atrocities to fairly, to execute a fairly effective propaganda campaign in America. Now on top of that-- and this is something that Wilson speaks very strongly about in his speech-- is the notion of fighting for democracy."
Social Studies,"And what you have here, in the First World War, the Central Powers. You're talking about the German Empire, you're talking about the Austro-Hungarians. These are monarchies. These are emperors who are controlling it. And even though the UK, the United Kingdom, was nominally a kingdom, it was really a democracy. At least for those who could vote. We're not talking about the entire British Empire. So UK is functionally a democracy, democratic. And so was the Third French Republic. And so was France."
Social Studies,"So there's this argument that the US is fighting for the representation of people. Now, there is a more cynical argument that some people have made. And I think it's reasonable to give that to due time. And one of the cynical arguments, or more cynical arguments, is that the US had close financial and trade ties to Britain, not to mention cultural ties. Financial ties to the British. On top of that, you had very successful British propaganda."
Social Studies,"One, talking about the atrocities in Belgium, which did actually happen. But the British were able to exploit this as a propaganda machine. Successful propaganda. But they also spread rumors that after the sinking of the Lusitania that the Germans had their school children celebrating. And these were all made up propaganda. And then, more cynical view of why the US entered the war-- and this is true of probably most wars-- is that there was a lot of lobbying on the part of war profiteers."
Social Studies,"In fact, in ""Little Orphan Annie,"" Daddy Warbucks, the name, the reason why his last name is Warbucks is because he made his fortune as a war profiteer during World War I. And war profiteers, these are people who might be selling arms to the Allies. Or who might sell arms to the US government if the US were to get into a war that might somehow supply the troops. And it includes, potentially, folks on Wall Street. There were significant lending to the Allies, and mainly the Allies, not the Central Power."
Social Studies,"And so the view is if the Allies win, those loans are going to be made good. And I had the entire text of the speech from Senator George Norris who was one of five senators, or sorry, one of six senators to vote against the resolution to go to war. There were 50 representatives who also voted against it. This is a little excerpt but also in this tutorial, I have the full text of his speech."
Social Studies,"And I highly, highly, highly recommend reading that along with Wilson's text of his speech to Congress in his war message. But I'll just read this part because it does, I think, point out that the US, from the beginning, did have biases that were more pro-British. And so this is part of his speech."
Social Studies,"""The reason given by the President in asking Congress to declare war against Germany is that the German government has declared certain war zones, within which by the use of submarines, she sinks, without notice, American ships and destroys American lives. The first war zone was declared by Great Britain. She gave us and the world notice of it on the 4th day of November 1914. The zone became effective November 5, 1914. This zone, so declared by Great Britain, covered the whole of the North Sea."
Social Studies,"The first German war zone was declared on the 4th day of February, 1915, just three months after the British war zone was declared. Germany gave 15 days notice of the establishment of her zone, which became effective on the 18th day of February, 1915. The German war zone cover the English Channel and the high seawaters around the British Isles. It is unnecessary to cite authority to show that both of these orders declaring military zones were illegal and contrary to international law."
Social Studies,"It is sufficient to say that our government has officially declared both of them to be illegal and has officially protested against both of them. The only difference is that, in the case of Germany we have persisted in our protest, while in the case of England, we have submitted."" And I encourage you, once again, to read the text of both Wilson's speech and Senator Norris' speech and come up to your, with your own decisions. And it might be a little bit of both.."
Social Studies,"of the Jewish people. It's the location of Jerusalem. In 135 of the Common Era the Roman emperor, Hadrian, is able to suppress a rebellion by the Jews in Judea and after suppressing that rebellion, he expels the Jews from Judea. Hadrian expels the Jews from Judea. Not only did he expel them from Judea, but he actually renamed the province. This province up here in red was Roman Syria. He merges these two provinces and calls them Syria Palaestina. Let me write that down."
Social Studies,"He renames it Syria Palaestina, which is essentially why for the next 1700 years or so and even parts of it today are referred to as Palestine. Now, we will fast forward over the next more than 1700 years. Over this period most of the Jewish people are not now living in what was then Judea. They have settled in groups in Europe, in the Middle East, in Africa. There were even groups of Jews who had settled in India."
Social Studies,"For the most part they thrived in their various communities, but unfortunately their history had a fairly large amount of persecution, of discrimination, of kind of using them as a scapegoat. This was particularly the case in Europe where you have the Christian church often kind of blamed the Jews on religious grounds. They were an easy scapegoat any time things went hard. You had ethnic cleansing. You had pogroms."
Social Studies,"This was the Russian empire, especially as we get into the 1800s, was especially infamous in its treatment of the Jews. You have this long history of Jewish persecution. In fact, much of Jewish tradition today is around remembrances of these various tragedies, these various persecutions. With that as the context, we then get into the late 1800s. Let's go to 1860. 1860. You have the birth of Theodor Herzl. 1860. You have the birth of this gentleman right over here. Theodor Herzl born."
Social Studies,"He's born to a German-speaking Jewish family in the Austro-Hungarian empire. The family he's born into isn't particularly religious. As a young man, he remains fairly secular. He's not a particularly religious person. As he grows and he becomes a journalist, he is able to observe the anti-Semitism, especially that's occurring especially in the late 1800s in Russia, but throughout much of Europe."
Social Studies,"In 1894, so at this point he's 34 years old, still a fairly young man, in 1894 in Paris he directly observes the Dreyfus affair. The Dreyfus affair, in which a French Jewish officer in the military is accused of treason, accused of spying for the Germans. This leads to all sorts of kind of public anti-Semitism. It later is shown that it was false claims on Dreyfus."
Social Studies,"Some people would debate whether this directly led to Theodor Herzl's articulation of a need for a Jewish homeland, but it was something that he directly observed, so it must have influenced him in some way. It was this and all the other anti-Semitism that he observed either directly or indirectly his entire life, or even that he was able to read in the history books."
Social Studies,"Taking all of that in, and this is coming from a fairly secular individual, in 1896 at the age of 36, he writes Der Judenstaat, which literally translates as the Jewish State. Der Judenstaat. This was a very articulate description or desire, or articulation I guess I should say, of the need for a Jewish homeland and a Jewish State. It's really the birth of political Zionism. Political Zionism. Now, where does the word Zionism come from? The root is Zion from Mount Zion."
Social Studies,"Mount Zion is essentially a hill in modern-day Jerusalem, but the word Zion is often equated with Jerusalem, with the Holy Land, with kind of the home of the Jews. That would be roughly right over here, Jerusalem is roughly right over here. I stress the modifier ""political,"" political Zionism, because there was already a movement to bring the Jewish people back to their ancient homeland in Judea, which could be referred to as Zionism."
Social Studies,"It was really Herzl who articulated a need to set up a political state and start to organize around trying to create a political state. Over here I quote some of what he wrote in Der Judenstaat. ""We are a people, one people. We have sincerely tried everywhere to merge with the national communities in which we live, seeking only to preserve the faith of our fathers. It is not permitted us. In vain we are loyal patriots, sometimes super loyal."
Social Studies,"In vain do we make the same sacrifices of life and property as our fellow citizens. In vain do we strive to enhance the fame of our native lands in the arts and sciences, or her wealth by trade and commerce. In our native lands, where we have lived for centuries, we are still decried as aliens often by men whose ancestors had not yet come at a time when Jewish sighs had long been heard in the country. Oppression and persecution cannot exterminate us."
Social Studies,"No nation on earth has endured such struggles and sufferings as we have. Palestine is our unforgettable homeland."" This ends up getting huge traction, resonates with the Jewish diaspora, gives him the power to essentially, the next year, organize in 1897 the first Zionist Congress, first Zionist Congress where he's able to bring together likeminded, or at least people who are looking to organize a way to eventually establish a Jewish State, preferably in Palestine."
Social Studies,"I say preferably in Palestine, and it's clear that this was the first choice, to go back to the historical homeland of Judea, but even Herzl himself had considered Argentina, which at the time was very open-minded, very open towards immigration. There was some talk of East Africa, British East Africa. In fact, the British offered Uganda in 1903 to the what would later be called the Zionist Organization. It was considered and I believe it was the sixth Zionist Congress."
Social Studies,"These were things that were actually considered. But Palestine was always, because of historical reasons, the hopeful home of the Zionist Movement. I fully realize this is an incredibly touchy issue regardless of where people stand on their views of Zionism or of Theodor Herzl. Some would view him as a visionary, view him as a hero, some would view him as starting the seed that led to the eventual occupation of Palastine and the settlements that are going on there."
Social Studies,"I will try my best to stay out of picking sides there. Regardless of where you are in that argument, it's pretty amazing how much foresight he actually had and his ability to get this thing going. Even from the get-go, he had some conversations with the Ottomans and other folks about being able to get land in Palestine and all the rest. He wasn't successful in his own lifetime."
Social Studies,"But even after that first Zionist Congress, which was held in Basel, he understood what he was doing and he was looking beyond his own lifetime. This is a quote here from his journal and it's pretty telling. ""Were I to sum up the Basel Congress in a word, which I shall guard against pronouncing publically, it would be this: At Basel I founded the Jewish State. If I said this out loud today I would be greeted by universal laughter."
Social Studies,"In five years perhaps, and certainly in 50 years, everyone will perceive it."" This is an amazing impresison because the state of Israel would come into a reality in roughly 50 years. With that said, and once again I know this is an incredibly touchy issue, the one thing that is probably surprising to many people is that he was not an extreme individual."
Social Studies,"It comes out from some of his other writing that even though he wanted this Jewish State, he was a fairly tolerant individual and he did not view this only for the Jews and he didn't feel that it should be taken by force or in any other way. It comes out in his writing right over here. This is from his diary."
Social Studies,"""It goes without saying that we shall respectfully tolerate persons of other faiths and protect their property, their honor and their freedom with the harshest means of coercion."" So protect their property, honor and ... using the harshest means of coercion to protect their property, their honor and their freedom. This is a tolerant thing to do. ""This is another area in which we shall set the entire world a wonderful example."
Social Studies,"Should there be many such immovable owners in individual areas who will not sell their property to us."" So, hey, if we want to go there and properly buy land but people don't want to sell it to us, ""we shall simply leave them there and develop our commerce in the direction of other areas which belong to us."" He wasn't in the mood to really get into a confrontation or to antagonize anyone."
Social Studies,"And he recognized that there were other people there that might not want to sell their land to those that might settle this new State. Later on his life, actually shortly before his death, he actually writes a novel about this potential State that might be created. He writes, and this is written in Altneuland, it literally translates to The Old New Land, ""It is founded on the ideas which are a common product of all civilized nations."
Social Studies,"It would be immoral if we would exclude anyone whatever his origin, his decent, or his religion, from participating in our achievements, for we stand on the shoulders of other civilized peoples. What we own we owe to the preparatory work of other peoples. Therefore, we have to repay our debt. There's only one way to do it. The highest tolerance. Our motto must therefore be, now and ever: Man, you are my brother.""."
Social Studies,"the modern world, especially the world of the twentieth century. You had fronts, campaigns in Africa, between the various colonies that the empires had in Africa. You had a front here in the Caucasus between the Ottoman empire and Russia. You had Japan involved. Japan, in World War I was on the side of the allies. It wasn't one of the major actors in World War I, but it helped provide naval support, it helped against some of Germany's colonies in the pacific and in China."
Social Studies,"What I really want to focus on in this video is in some ways one of the most interesting campaigns, or I guess several campaigns of World War I, because it really helped shape the modern Middle East and a lot of the way countries are shaped now and a lot of the conflicts we now see in the Middle East to some degree can be tied to what happened leading up to World War I and what happened after World War I."
Social Studies,"Just as a little bit of context, this entire region right over here, what we consider to be the Middle East now, especially Arabia, was nominally under Ottoman control. The Ottoman empire had been losing power for centuries leading up to the twentieth century, especially if you look at the Arabian Peninsula. It wasn't direct Ottoman control. It was very hard to control the various Arab tribes there."
Social Studies,"Egypt by this point, as we enter into World War I, in the late 1800s the British occupied, began to occupy Egypt, essentially took control of Egypt. As we enter into World War I, Egypt is officially a protectorate of the British empire. Egypt is, for all purposes, it is British. Egypt is of huge strategic interest at this point in time. In fact, it continues to be of huge strategic interest because it has the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal is right over here."
Social Studies,"It's a man-made canal, made in 1869 by the French, and it connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea. To see its importance, you just have to look at the map at a more global scale. It's the fastest way to get from Europe by ship into the Red Sea and into the Arabian Sea and to India, which was a significant part of the British empire there, or to go further East, go into the Indian Ocean and go to places further East. It was of huge, huge, huge strategic interest."
Social Studies,"That lays the groundwork for, essentially, the various campaigns. Oftentimes they would be collectively called the Middle East campaigns, or they're separated sometimes as the Sinai and Palestine campaign and the Mesopotamia campaign. Mesopotamia, that's in modern-day Iraq. The Sinai Peninsula, that's part of modern-day Egypt. Palestine in 1914, what was then considered Palestine, is now part of Israel, part of the West Bank, part of the Gaza Strip, part Lebanon."
Social Studies,"As we'll see, all of these countries that we now recognize as different countries, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, these were all kind of carved and shaped by what happened during World War I and at the end of World War I. As we get to the beginning, right at the outset in 1914, the British land right over here at the southern end of Mesopotamia. Over the course of the war they just keep driving northward along the Tigris River. They keep driving northward and northward and northward."
Social Studies,"By the end of the war, they've essentially captured what you would consider most of modern-day Iraq. For the most part, it was a very successful campaign for the British, although they did have some significant setbacks. In particular, at the end of 1915 you have the British who are held up in Kut. They were essentially sieged by the Ottoman empire, 147 days siege. After the 147 days they had to surrender. They were starving in there. They couldn't get supplies. They were dying of sickness."
Social Studies,"This is actually a picture of an Indian soldier after the siege of Kut, after they were taken by the Ottomans after they surrendered. Even though the Mesopotamian campaign was successful for the British, the siege of Kut is recorded in British military history, or global military history, as one of the biggest humiliations for the British army, where you had that many troops who had to surrender. They were starving, literally, to death."
Social Studies,"One thing I should point out: I'm going to be talking about the allies, the British troops, but in the Middle Eastern campaigns and the Sinai and Palestinian campaign and in the Mesopotamian campaign, Indian troops, which were part of the British empire, played a significant factor, especially in the Mesoptomian campaign, and so did the Australian and New Zealand troops. When we talk about British troops, we're also talking about all of the various nationalities that were part of the British empire."
Social Studies,"By 1918, they were able to capture much of what is now modern-day Iraq, or much of I guess you could say Mesopotamia. On the other side of, I guess you could call it on the Egyptian side of the campaign, the first few offensives were actually taken by the Ottomans. They say, ""Hey look, the British hold the Suez Canal."
Social Studies,"If we could take back the Suez Canal, that would be a pretty crippling blow for the British, especially in their ability to get to the various ports of their empire."" So in 1915, you have the Ottomans try to make an offensive to try to capture the Suez Canal. It's repulsed. It fails. They try again in 1916. That fails again. After that, the British then take the offensive. Once again, it's the British, but we're talking, they have Egyptian troops, they have Arab troops; well, Egyptians are Arabs."
Social Studies,"They have Australian troops with them. They have Indian troops with them. They start to make an offensive. That offensive essentially continues through the course of World War I. In 1915 they are able to defend the Suez Canal. In 1916 they defend it again. By 1917, they're making an offensive. After several tries, they're able to take Gaza in 1917. Then they're able to take Jerusalem, which was kind of a major source of prestige."
Social Studies,"Obviously Jerusalem has a thousands of years history of various armies trying to take Jerusalem. Then they continue on and as they saw that the end of the war was imminent, especially as we get into 1918, the British were, and the allies were, essentially on a land grab. They knew that as soon as an armistice is called, it's kind of your last chance to grab more land, and then it goes to the bureaucrats to start negotiating things."
Social Studies,"So in 1918 the British are essentially on a land grab, especially the allies. They take Damascus. They get all the way north to Aleppo. By the end of 1918 you essentially have the end of the war. You have an armistice at the end of October with the Ottoman empire. We know that the Austro-Hungarians signed their armistice in early November, and so do the Germans and World War I is over. Now, there's a bunch of interesting things here and I'm kind of doing a very broad survey of these campaigns."
Social Studies,"One is the famous movie Lawrence of Arabia. It took place during these campaigns. This is a picture of of T.E. Lawrence, who was many, many, many things, but he was this interesting character who helped the Arabs rise up against the Ottomans, against the Turkish rule. He was heavily involved in helping to coordinate the Arabs' uprising against the Ottomans. In this case, the Arabs were helping the allies essentially push the Ottomans back."
Social Studies,"The most interesting thing, the outcome of this, and we'll probably talk into a lot more detail about this in future videos, is because by the end of the war you have the allies in control of all of this territory ... in control ... let me do that in a better color ... in control of all of this territory, right over here, it was really left to them to carve up the modern Middle East. It was agreed to ahead of time that the French would gain control of what is now Syria and Lebanon."
Social Studies,"This is roughly, Lebanon's right over there. Syria, we're talking roughly this region, including Damascus, so roughly this region right over here, and it left the British in control of what is now Israel, Palestine, Jordan and Iraq. As we'll see as we go into the 1920s, this was all part of the British mandate."
Social Studies,"They carved it up and a lot of their decisions have led to a lot of what we now see as the modern Middle East, and the French essentially were in control up here in Lebanon and Syria as part of the French mandate.."
Social Studies,"Let's rewind back to October of 1915, or 1915 in particular. The British were already at war with the Ottoman's. Just as a reminder of some of what happened in 1915, the Gallipoli campaign, by the end of 1915 it was pretty clear that this was a disaster for the allies. The Ottoman's were able to fend off the allies, they were in retreat. The British were able to fend off the Ottoman's when they tried to attack the Suez canal in 1915."
Social Studies,"This is the background, you can imagine the British are eager to get any other allies they can in their battle against the Ottoman's. In particular, they are eager to get the help of the Arab's who have been under the rule of the Ottoman's for hundreds of years."
Social Studies,"That's the backdrop where you have this correspondence between the high commissioner in Egypt, the British high commissioner, Sir Henry McMahon and the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin ʿAli, who had his own aspirations to essentially be the king of an independent Arab state. They kept going back and forth from mid 1915 to early 1916 talking about what the state could be. Obviously the British want his support, wants him to lead a revolt against the Ottoman's."
Social Studies,"He's already articulated the boundaries for a state that he would like to see. So, that gives us a context for this correspondence in October of 1915. This is from Sir Henry McMahon to Hussein. ""... it is with great pleasure that I communicate to you ""on their behalf,"" the British government's behalf, ""the following statement, which I am confident ""you will receive with satisfaction."
Social Studies,"""The two districts of Mersina and Alexandretta ""and portions of Syria lying to the west ""of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama, ""and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, ""and should be excluded from the limits demanded."" This is referring to the limits that Hussein bin Ali had demanded in previous correspondence."
Social Studies,"""With the above modifications,"" so just that region right over there, this right over here is Mersina, Alexandretta, this is Hama, Homs, Damascus, so really what he's referring to is this region, the west, the west of those cities right over here. He's saying look, you can't really consider this to be purely Arab, I'm going to exclude this out of the boundaries of this potential independent Arab state."
Social Studies,"""With the above modification, and without prejudice ""to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs ""we accept those limits,"" we accept those limits."
Social Studies,"""As for those regions lying within those frontiers ""wherein Great Britain is free to act ""without determinant to the interest of her ally, ""France,"" so as long as I'm not getting in trouble with France, ""I'm empowered in the name of ""the Government of Great Britain to give the following ""assurances and make the following reply ""to your letter; Subject to the above modifications,"" so taking this part out, ""Great Britain is prepared ""to recognize and support the independence ""of the Arabs in all the regions within the limits ""demanded by the Sharif of Mecca."" So, essentially it included all of this region and actually much beyond what I'm showing here, kind of present day Syria, Jordan, Iraq, parts of present day Saudi Arabia."
Social Studies,"All of that is essentially, the British are saying, yeah we're going to allow you to have that, an independent state there. ""Great Britain will guarantee the Holy Places ""against all external aggression ""and will recognize their inviolability. ""..."
Social Studies,"I am convinced that this declaration will assure ""you beyond all possible doubt,"" beyond all possible doubt, ""of the sympathy ""of Great Britain towards the aspiration of her friends ""the Arabs, and will result in a firm ""and lasting alliance, the immediate results ""of which will be the expulsion of the Turks ""from the Arab countries and the freeing ""of the Arab peoples from the Turkish yoke, ""which for so many years has pressed heavily ""upon them."" This actually does help to convince the Arab's to rise up against the Turks, against the Ottoman Empire, they play a significant role in the Palestine Campaign, they rise up in June of 1916."
Social Studies,"Now, the video that I did on the Palestine Campaign, I got several comments of people being cynical about Britain's intentions and it does look like the British were, indeed, cynical. T.E. Lawrence famous for Lawrence of Arabia was often depicted as this mystical fellow, this guy who had this kinship with the Arab's. His actual correspondence with the British government actually do show that he did have a kind of ... he was doing, I guess, in the words of George W."
Social Studies,"Bush, a little bit of strategery, he had a more cynical view of this relationship with the Arab's. This is some correspondence that he wrote in early 1916, so right about the same time that all of this was going on. This says he's referring to a possible Arab revolt, or Hussein's activity."
Social Studies,"""Hussein's activity seems beneficial to us, ""because it matches with our immediate aims, ""the break-up of the Islamic 'bloc' ""and the defeat and disruption of the ""Ottoman Empire."" Assuming he didn't really talk about this, this being one of the ... the British didn't talk about that when they were talking to Hussein."
Social Studies,"""If we can arrange that this political change ""shall be a violent one, we will have abolished ""the threat of Islam, by dividing it against itself, ""in its very heart."" ""There will then be a Khalifa,"" kind of a seat of Islam, ""in Turkey ""and a Khalifa in Arabia, in theological warfare."" This is T.E. Lawrence, I got this from The Golden Warrior: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia. Even this, somewhat portrayed as a heroic figure, was doing things in very strategic, strategic terms."
Social Studies,"To make things worse for the Arab's, while the British were trying to convince them to revolt, they were also in secret negotiations with the French on how they would divide the Middle East if they were able to beat the Ottoman's. At this point in the war the British were already making some progress in Mesopotamia, but they really hadn't really started on the Palestine Campaign right here. So, this was all conjecture."
Social Studies,"The British representatives was Sykes, the French representative was Picot, this was done with the consent of the Russian's. You didn't have a revolution in Russia as of now, so in early 1916, in May this agreement was concluded, this secret agreement. You have the Sykes-Picot Agreement, it's secret. Let me write that, it is a secret agreement between Britain and France and essentially they are carving up the entire Middle East between them."
Social Studies,"This blue area right here, this would be occupied by the French, part of eastern Turkey or modern day eastern Turkey would be given to the Russian's. The British would be able to occupy, would occupy southern Mesopotamia essentially insuring protection of the oil that is coming out of Persia. Oil is becoming more and more of a relevant factor in kind of global power."
Social Studies,"Then you have these two protectorates right over here, which in theory could be independent or an independent Arab state, or two independent Arab states under the protection."
Social Studies,"Let me put that in quotes, because ""protectorate"" is always not as nice as it sounds, under the protection of the French or the British which means, ""Hey you're an independent state, but we will ""protect you in case anyone wants to invade."" The reality of protectorate is that it usually involves the people doing the protecting have all the real power and all the real influence. The Sykes-Picot Agreement also give this little carve out to Britain so they would have access to the Mediterranean."
Social Studies,"Palestine, or the Roman Kingdom of Judea, this is carved out as a separate international property something that would be administered by multiple states and I guess the argument would be, this is where the Holy Land's are, multiple religions have some of their holiest sites within here and so they carved it out like this. Once again, this is all in secret, they obviously don't want the Arab's to find out because they're about to convince the Arab's to join in a revolt against the Ottoman's."
Social Studies,"Now, to make things ... once again, this was all secret up to this point in 1916 when it was all agreed on. Then you forward to 1917 where we have the famous Balfour Declaration. This right over here is the Balfour Declaration and it was essentially a letter from the Foreign Secretary of the U.K., Balfour, to Lord Rothschild who was a leading [Briticizen] , a leading member of the Jewish community."
Social Studies,"In it he writes, ""Dear Lord Rothschild, ""I have much pleasure in conveying to you, ""on behalf of His Majesty's Government, ""the following declaration of sympathy ""with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been ""submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet. ""His Majesty's Government view with favor ""the establishment in Palestine of a national home,"" of a national home, ""for the Jewish people, ""and will use their best endeavors to facilitate ""the achievement of this objective."
Social Studies,"""It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done ""which may prejudice the civil and religious rights ""of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, ""or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews ""in any other country. ""I should be grateful if you would bring ""this declaration to the knowledge of the ""Zionist Federation."" Signed Artur Balfour. In here, he's not explicitly saying ..."
Social Studies,"and they're being very careful here, he's not saying we're supporting a state for the Jewish people, but he's saying he is supporting the return of national home for the Jewish people, but at the same time, he's saying that it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. Needless to say, you can imagine that this is making the Arab's fairly uncomfortable."
Social Studies,"On one side it seems, based on some of the McMahon-Hussein correspondences that were ... especially in 1915, that they were being promised an independent Arab state which included much of this territory, but at the same time, in the Balfour Declaration the British were promising to, kind of the Jewish diaspora, that they could have a homeland there and it might one day, who knows, it might one day turn in to some type of a state. To make the Arab's even more uncomfortable, this was in November 2, 1917."
Social Studies,"By the end of November, you have to remember that 1917 you first had a revolution, in Russia the Czar was overthrown in February and in March of 1917, and October the Bolshevik's take over. They want to get out of the war, they don't like all these secret deals, not clear that they would even get what they were entitled to these secret deals, so they actually release all the entire text of the Sykes-Picot Agreement."
Social Studies,"They released this, so in the same month you have the Arab's and the Ottoman's and the Ottoman's were very happy to see this because it would undermine the Arab's belief in maybe supporting the allies, but in one month you have the Arab's finding out about the Balfour Declaration, which was a pulbic declaration and then later that month because of the Russian release of it, the formally secret Sykes-Picot Agreement, so it makes them very, or at least a little bit more suspicious."
Social Studies,"So you can imagine the British Empire trying to have it both ways, to kind of have support from the Jewish Diaspora while at the same time have support from the Arab's in their revolt against the Ottoman's would lead to very significant conflicts over the decades to come. Regardless of which side of the issue you fall on, a lot of the seed is happening right around now, right around World War I. This has been admitted by the British government."
Social Studies,"This is right here, this was the then Secretary, or Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, U.K Foreign Secretary in 2002. This is a statement he made to the News Statesman Magazine in 2002. ""A lot of the problems we are having to deal with now, ""I have to deal with now,"" he's the Foreign Secretary, ""are a consequence ""of our colonial past ..."" Consequence of our colonial past."
Social Studies,"""The Balfour Declaration and the contradictory assurances,"" ""and the contradictory assurances ""which were being given to Palestinian's ""in private at the same time as they were ""being given to the Israelis ..."
Social Studies,"""again, an interesting history for us, ""but not an honorable one."" This is really just the beginning as we'll see in future videos as we go to the Interwar period, the British kind of go back and forth on this issue over, over, and over again, but needless to say, it's lead to a very messy situation in the modern Middle East.."
Social Studies,"The British also had Kuwait as a protectorate and this is from the 1800's and they don't get their independence until 1961. We also know that the British were eager to get the help of the Arab's, to essentially convince the Arab's to revolt against the Ottoman's so that they could successfully fight the Ottoman's on the Sinai and Palestine fronts and on the Mesopotamia front."
Social Studies,"In particular, they tried to convince this gentleman, Hussein bin Ali, who at the time, at the beginning of World War I is the Sharif of Mecca. In order to convince him they made promises to him. We have a whole video on the McMahon-Hussein correspondence. They say look if you help up us we will give you and independent state, an independent Arab state that would include all of this territory except for maybe, except for maybe this region right up here."
Social Studies,"So, with those British assurances he agrees to commit his forces to fight in the Arab revolt, to rise up and to help the British. From that point on in 1916 where you have the Arab revolt, he declares himself as the King of the Hejaz. Just as a little bit of a geography tangent right over here, this is the Hejaz. It's kind of the west coast of the Arabian peninsula and it contains the very influential towns of Mecca and Medina."
Social Studies,"You might say, well whatever happened to the Hejaz? Isn't all of this region right now Saudi Arabia? And you are correct. What happened shortly after, so in 1916 he declares himself King of the Hejaz but then you had another group, the Saudi's in the Nejd region, which is this area right over here. They are able to, in 1925, successfully, successfully, successfully conquer the Nejd and you have Ibn Saud who declares himself King of the Nejd and Hejaz from 1926 to 1932."
Social Studies,"He later merges them into Saudi Arabia and he's the first King of Saudi Arabia all the way until 1953. That's how you get Saudi Arabia. Now, let's continue, let's rewind back to World War I. You have the Arab revolt. Hussein bin Ali declares himself the King of the Hejaz. Two of his sons are very active in collaborating with the British to fight against the Ottoman's. This right over here is Faisal bin Hussein. Bin Hussein literally means son of Hussein. This right over here is Abdullah."
Social Studies,"By the end of the war, and we covered this in the Sinai, Palestine and Mesopotamia Campaigns, the combined British and Arab forces are able to move all the way into, all the way into what is now northern Syria. They're all able to move into what is now northern Iraq. You can imagine at this point, the Arab's are eager in a post world environment to have their state. The reason why they're a little bit unceratin about their future is based on what some of the things that came out during the war."
Social Studies,We now know that while the British were trying to convince Hussein bin Ali to get his forces to rise up against the Ottoman's they were dealing with the French in the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement to essentially carve up this whole territory between the British and the French. They really weren't talking about independent states for the Arab's.
Social Studies,"A few years later in 1917, this was still during the war, while the war was happening, you have the Balfour Declaration, which declared the British intent to create a homeland for the Jewish people. Then a month later, really the end of that month, November 1917, the Russian's make the Sykes-Picot Agreement public, so all of these things made the Arab's very uneasy. They got assurances from the British that oh that wasn't that serious of an agreement, just keep fighting with us."
Social Studies,"So, at the end of the war they were eager to get, what they thought, was their just claim. So you have Faisal bin Hussein, he attends the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. (writing) So in 1919 you have the Paris, Paris Peace Conference and just to be clear at that point in time it wasn't obvious that you necessarily had to have this, what we now have, is this conflict between what is now Israel and the Arab people."
Social Studies,"Faisal bin Hussein was actually eager to kind of reach out to the World Zionist Organization, to the Zionist movement to hopefully get their help in establishing an independent Arab state. He didn't think that they would, that it would establish an independent Jewish state, but he said hey look if they can have a homeland here but in order to get that homeland, they're willing to support me for an independent Arab state then I might kind of send out an olive branch to them."
Social Studies,"This right over here is a quote by Faisal bin Hussein. This is while he was trying to get support for an independent Arab state, one that he would argue, was promised to him by the McMahon Correspondences with his father. So, this is Faisal. ""We Arabs, look with the deepest sympathy ""on the Zionist movement. ""Our deputation here in Paris is fully ""acquainted with the proposal submitted yesterday ""by the Zionist Organization to the Peace Conference ""and we regard them as moderate and proper."
Social Studies,"""We will do our best, in so far as we are concerned ""to help them through, we will wish the Jews ""a most hearty welcome home."
Social Studies,"""I look forward, and my people with me look forward ""to a future in which we will help you and you will ""help us so that the countries in which we are ""mutually interested may once again take their ""places in the community of the civilized peoples ""of the world."" But he did throw in this caveat, he was doing this because he wanted their support for an independent state and he did throw in the caveat, look this only applies, I'm only supportive, essentially, of the Balfour Declaration if we get our independent state."
Social Studies,"He really wanted ... he really wanted an independent, (writing) independent state. He explicitly said, hey look if we don't get an independent state all the stuff I said here, doesn't really apply. So you end of with the Treaty of Sev in 1920. It turns out that the Sykes-Picot Agreement held a lot more weight than the assurances between McMahon and Hussein because in the Treaty of Sev, this area was divided, essentially, according to the Sykes-Picot Agreement."
Social Studies,"Up here, this whole region was given to France, they called it a mandate, which is essentially it was allowed to be occupied by France but they called it a mandate. The allies wanted it to be called a mandate so it didn't look like France was getting something. A mandate is kind of, hey you have to come help these people to transition them to establish a state, to help them transition institutions so eventually they can get independence."
Social Studies,"The allies wanted it to appear that, look central powers, look Ottoman's, you're not giving us something, you're not giving us this territory, you're giving us a responsibility. Needless to say, they were eager to occupy this territory, so eager that when Faisal bin Hussein, in 1920, declared himself King of Syria, they booted him out. He was in really no power to contest that booting out."
Social Studies,"This area right over here, this was pretty much in line with the Sykes-Picot Agreement, became a British, this whole area right over here became a British mandate. Now, in what is now Iraq, you essentially have an uprising in 1920, they don't appreciate, they thought that they were going to become independent now. They were free of the Ottoman's, but now all of a sudden the British come and say that they are in charge. So you have this revolt against the British in 1920."
Social Studies,"The British start to realize, gee this is kind of expensive trying to keep control of this maybe we should install someone, and we'll still kind of keep this as a protectorate as a mandated territory, but why don't we install someone, an Arab leader, as the King of this region. So, the install Faisal bin Hussein as a King of Iraq. He is a King of Iraq, essentially under protection, or under influence of the British from 1921 until 1933 and that's when they finally get independence of the British, in 1932."
Social Studies,"When they get booted out of Syria, his brother Abdullah, son of Hussein bin Ali, he's allowed to become King of trans Jordan. They later get independence in 1946 after World War II at which point he becomes the King of Jordan. Syria and Lebanon, they don't get independence until during or after World War II. Lebanon gets independence in 1943, Syria gets independence from the French in 1946."
Social Studies,"And we know that the mandate of Palestine, which the British kept, this would continue to be a sore point through World War II and then with the establishment of the state of Israel shortly afterwards, it becomes a very, I guess we could say, hot point in international affairs.."
Social Studies,"It's probably a good thing to look for those images because it will remind you how disgusting and gross and crazy wars can be. Sometimes we abstract it when we look at it in hindsight and we just talk about the numbers. World War I was gruesome, especially because this was the first time that industrialized weapons were really put to use in a war context. There was far more bloodshed than I think any of the fighting powers actually believed there would be."
Social Studies,"Just to put things in to numbers, and these are huge numbers, and these are frankly abstract numbers; numbers that are hard for us to comprehend. We don't know the exact numbers, as you can imagine, it's not easy to take a census. The military's have a better count of who might have been killed or who might be missing. The civilian casualties are almost impossible to count. You have people who are inadvertently killed by a bomb, you have people who are dying of starvation, who are dying due to famine."
Social Studies,"These are very hard numbers to count, but there is some consensus on the rough estimates on the total casualties in World War I. In particular, I'm going to focus here on the deaths, when people talk about casualties that often will also talk about injured. Just the deaths alone, the estimates I've seen, and I encourage you to look up your own and try to figure out what consensus you could get to, but the estimates I've seen have on the order of 16 million, million deaths during or due to World War I."
Social Studies,"If we were to break down those deaths, we have 8-10 million in the military. So, directly military these are death of soldiers, so this is the military. It was roughly, based on the accounts that I've seen, about 60% of these deaths were amongst the Entente, and about 40% were amongst the central powers, but in either case, we're talking about millions on either side of World War I and then the rest, if we're talking on the order of about 6-7 million were civilians. (writing) 6-7 millions civilians."
Social Studies,"The estimates I've seen were about 1 million plus that were directly due to military action. This is military action impacting civilians. This was disproportionately felt on the side of the Entente, on the side of the allies. If you look at where, especially the western front was fought, it becomes clear and also much of where the eastern front was fought."
Social Studies,"The eastern front, a lot of it was fought on Russian land, or what was controlled by the Russian Empire at the time and on the western front, much of the, or most of the battle was in France and in Belgium and also in Italy, that was also where you had a significant amount of the battle actually going on. So, this is why the allies, the Entente, felt a disproportionate number of the civilian that's directly due to military casualties."
Social Studies,"But then on top of that, the rest of the civilian count, this is what's, frankly, very hard to get an exact number on, this would be due to famine, starvation, disease. (writing) disease. We've talked before about the blockade of the central powers. You had definitely people not being able to kind of eat properly, you had the Spanish Flu."
Social Studies,"It was just an all around ugly situation and then to make matters worse, and this is what the history books often forget, you often had an explicit extermination of peoples' trying to happen during World War I. In fact, the, I guess, most notable, but often forgotten was the Armenian genocide. There was actually an explicit campaign on the part of the Ottoman's and this actually started before World War I, but it kind of hit full pace during World War I where 1 to ..."
Social Studies,"I've seen estimates of 1 million to 1.5 million Armenian's were systematically ... I'm talking about men, women, children, systematically killed by the Ottoman government. War is ugly and it brings out the worst in people and you see it just from these numbers. Just to give a context of all this is ... it's very easy for us just to abstract these things, but I really wanted to sit in how horrible this was, but just to kind of bring it all into focus."
Social Studies,"This right here is a passage from The Atlantic Monthly, Volume 129 that was published in 1922 and it's a passage on Joseph Tumulty's book. Joseph Tumulty was the Private Secretary, what is now called the Chief of Staff, of President Woodrow Wilson. This is about his account of being with Woodrow Wilson after the war was declared in World War I. It's fascinating because it applies, frankly, to most wars, or all wars. The War President and the War."
Social Studies,"""At the time of delivering his far-echoed ""war message, in April 1917, the President was ""cheered by dense multitudes thronging the streets ""as he passed from the White House to the Capital ""and back again. ""This is from Tumulty's,"" that's Woodrow Wilson's Chief of Staff, or it was called Private Secretary then. ""This is from Tumulty's own description of the return: 'For a while he,'"" and we're talking about Woodrow Wilson, ""'For a while, he sat silent and pale in ""'the Cabinet room."
Social Studies,"""'At last he said, 'Think what it was they ""'were applauding.'"" ""'My message today was a message of death ""'for our young men. ""'How strange it seems to applaud that.'""."
Social Studies,"The main argument they give is this unrestricted submarine warfare that the Germans are undertaking. You also have the fall of the Russian Empire. ... Fall of Russian Empire... You have the revolution that overthrows the Czar in February, March of 1917, and then in October, you have the Bolsheviks take over in a coup. This essentially, the Bolsheviks, once they take over, they have no interest in terms of continuing the war with Germany."
Social Studies,"So you have an armistice declared and the Russians are in the process of negotiating the terms of a treaty with the Central Powers. They're kind of negotiating the Brest-Litovsk Treaty as we speak. On top of that, you have, because the central powers don't have to focus on Russia on the eastern front anymore, they're trying to bring their, especially Germany, is trying to bring its troops back to the western front, and they want to do it before the U.S. can mobilize in any significant way."
Social Studies,"So, race on western front ... western front ... Between, essentially, can Germany get its troops and do an offensive that can put probably France out of the war before the U.S. has a chance to significantly reinforce the western front? This is essentially between German, redeploy troops from the eastern front, German troops ... troops from eastern, from eastern front versus new American troops ... versus new Americans. This is the backdrop."
Social Studies,"No one really knew what exactly was going to happen on the western front. Certain military analysts will say Germany was able to prosecute this two front war against a major empire and Russia, now they're going to be able to focus completely on the western front, Germany might be able to deal the decisive blow. Others would say the U.S. it's this emerging power, it's bringing fresh troops in, it has a major industrial capacity. The U.S. could, especially if the war were to last a good bit, the U.S."
Social Studies,"might be the decisive element for the allies. So that's the background in which President Wilson, President Woodrow Wilson on January of 1918, January 8th, gives a speech to the joint sessions of congress. This is part of the text of the speech, I'm just going to read through it, I'm not going to read the entire speech. He talks about many things, essentially; why are we in World War I, what is the moral causes of World War I, and his speech is most famous for his articulation of the ""Fourteen Points""."
Social Studies,"Let's just read into it because it really informs a lot of what happened in the Treaty of Versailles, which is essentially the peace treaty with Germany, which the U.S. ironically did not ratify, but it also lays out the tension in the Paris Peace Conferences after World War I between those who were more idealistic like Woodrow Wilson, and those who might have been a little bit more vengeful, especially against the Central Powers."
Social Studies,"Here we go, this is part of the speech: ""We enter this war because violations of right had occurred which touched us to the quick and made the life of our own people impossible unless they were corrected and the world secured once for all against their recurrence. What we demand in this war, therefore, is nothing peculiar to ourselves. it is that the world be made fit and safe to live in ..."" This is very idealistic."
Social Studies,"Remember, all these others, especially these European powers are all about who gets what land, who gets what empire, who gets to take advantage of whatever colony. ""... and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine is own institutions, be assured of justice and fair dealing by the other peoples of the world as against force and selfish aggression."
Social Studies,"All the peoples of the world are in effect partners in this interest, and for our own part, we see very clearly that unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us. The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, all we see it, is this:"" These are his Fourteen Points and I'll try to kind of give some context for each of them."
Social Studies,"The first is: ""Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view."" The context here is actually after the Bolsheviks took over, they started releasing all these secret covenants and understandings that the Russian Empire had been getting into."
Social Studies,"We've already talked about all the entanglements and the alliances that led to World War I, so this is Wilson's attempt to say, ""Hey, let's just do everything out in the open."
Social Studies,"That'll let everyone kind of know, give more transparency, what may or may not occur, based on their actions."" Number 2, ""Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants."" So no more of these British blockades, no more of this unrestricted submarine warfare, the only time we can dictate what happens in open waters is if the international community trying to decide that it wants to enforce international covenants."
Social Studies,"Number 3, ""The removal of all economic barriers and the establishment of equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance."" So essentially, it's free trade. ... free trade ..."
Social Studies,"Number 4, ""Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety."" So he's trying to undo some of this militarism, this buildup of arms that essentially allowed World War I to happen with the ferocity that it did and with the quickness with which it did."
Social Studies,"Number 5, ""A free,open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance ot the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined."" This is a big deal that probably did not make the British or the French happy."
Social Studies,"This is essentially saying self-determination, the people who are in those nations, in those states, their interests matter just as much. ""A free open-minded absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims."" This is a pretty big deal. Remember, we're kind of exiting this period of empires, most of the European powers still think that these international empires are essentially part of their prestige."
Social Studies,"Number 6, ""The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing ..."" This is still one sentence and then you put period there, semi-colon ..."
Social Studies,"And I guess he had to read that himself, "" ... And, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come ..."" Remember, they're negotiating with the Central Powers on Brest-Litovsk, "" ..."
Social Studies,"to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy."" So it's saying look, Wilson doesn't know whether the allies or the Central Powers are going to win on the western front, but they know that the Central Powers are dictating terms to Russia with Brest-Litovsk."
Social Studies,"It's like, this is going to be a test of your good will, of your comprehension of the need of this newly-emerging of state now that the Bolsheviks have taken over. Obviously at this point, you don't have the antagonism between the U.S. and the future Soviet Union that is going to emerge. They're saying give Russia a chance to be herself."
Social Studies,"Number 7, ""Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations."" This is kind of obvious. When the Germans rolled through Belgium, that's how they got to France. It was a justification that Great Britain used for entering the war, so get out of Belgium."
Social Studies,"Number 8, ""All French territories should be freed and invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest of all."" Alsace-Lorraine, we've touched on it several times. That's this region right over here."
Social Studies,"It was taken by Germany, essentially the unification of Germany during the Franco-Prussian War, which was a [unintelligible] region. This was one of the justifications, this was why France might have gone into a war with Germany, and what Germany almost wanted to be preemptive against France because they said France might want to take some of that territory back."
Social Studies,"9, ""A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality."" Hey, where do people speak Italian? 10, ""The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity of autonomous development."" This is another big deal. It's another breaking up of an empire. It's another self-determination point of the ""Fourteen Points"". Austria-Hungary, we've already said it was an empire."
Social Studies,"It included many, many, many nationalities. You have the Czechs right around there. You have the Slovacs right around there. You have the Austrians, German-speaking people, right over there. You have the Hungarians, roughly over there. You have the Slovenians roughly over there. You have the Croatians roughly over there. You have the Bosnians roughly over there. You have many, many other nationalities especially as you get close to the border with Romania and the border with the Ukraine."
Social Studies,"It's like, let these people determine, let them determine their own fate to some degree. There are all these nationalities. That was number 10. ""The freest opportunity to autonomous development."" He's not saying that they necessarily need their own states, but that they should have the opportunity to self-govern in some way."
Social Studies,"Number 11, ""Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated; occupied territories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relations of the several Balkan states to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan states should be entered into."" This is kind of laying the groundwork for the future state of Yugoslavia, which is going to be roughly over there."
Social Studies,"It's kind of the state of the southern Slavs, which is what the whole motivation [unintelligible] for assassinating Archduke Ferdinand which some would argue was kind of the spark that lit World War I. ""The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of an autonomous development ..."" Once again, self-determination."
Social Studies,"""... and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees."" So the Dardanelles, we've talked about it before, that is, that's this right over here, so that you have access between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. And we are almost there."
Social Studies,"So then you have, ""An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant."" Poland did not exist as its own state prior to World War I. Now you have Woodrow Wilson is advocating it. It will be carved out roughly of this area right over there."
Social Studies,"Then finally, point 14, ""A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike."" This is essentially, this is the point, that leads to the formation of the League of Nations. When we talk about big ideas, this is a big idea, especially back then. You have Europe who keeps getting into wars with each other."
Social Studies,"Hey, why don't we all cooperate at this middle level and we have this club of all of the nations to resolve disputes and make sure that we don't have another World War I. So, very, very, very big idealistic idea, it gets formed as an outcome of the Treaty of Versailles, which is drafted during the Paris Peace Conferences after World War I."
Social Studies,"The unfortunate thing of the League of Nations is that even though this was kind of, the idea was coming from Woodrow Wilson, the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations was not ratified by the U.S. The U.S. never entered the League of Nations, which kind of made it a little bit hollow, and the League of Nations did not have the power to stop World War II from happening only a few decades later, and would later be replaced by the United Nations. This is a really, really, really, really big idea."
Social Studies,"Because of these big ideas, Woodrow Wilson, these very idealistic ideas, everyone in Europe is talking about territory and imperialism and how do they take control of other people, take control of their resources, and now you have the American President saying it's all about self-determination. It's about making the world safe for democracy, safe for commerce, about open agreements. It's a very powerful idea."
Social Studies,"This would kind of form the basis, the more idealistic side of American Foreign Policy over the 20th Century. Some would say that there's another very cynical side that takes into account self-interest, but this is the idealistic side of American Foreign Policy, especially through the 20th Century. For this, for his work in this in this area, Woodrow Wilson wins the Nobel Prize a few years later. This right here is a picture of the Nobel Prize looks like, both sides of it."
Social Studies,"Now, just to kind of foreshadow some of the tension as we get into the Paris Peace Conference, not everyone was as idealistic. You obviously these European powers who bled much harder than the Americans did, although the Americans did contribute significant cost, or troops, to the effort and they lost many, many folks. Obviously if you're French, you had these Germans on your territory. You lost a significant fraction of your population, a huge fraction of your male population."
Social Studies,"You might be a little bit angrier. So of course, you have Georges Clemenceau who was the Prime Minister of France. He was a little bit more skeptical of the ""Fourteen Points"". This is a quote from him, he actually has many slightly entertaining quotes, ""Mr. Wilson bores me with his ""Fourteen Points"" while God Almighty has only ten."" This will kind of foreshadow some of the tension between Clemenceau and the British, and European allies on one side, and the Americans as we go to the Paris Peace Conference."
Social Studies,"They were a little bit looking out more for revenge, especially against the Germans while the Americans, especially Woodrow Wilson, was a lot more idealistic.."
Social Studies,"At this conference, you have all the parties of all the major warring parties, but the terms of peace are dictated by the winners. The major powers among the winners are led by these gentlemen right over here. This is Prime Minister Lloyd George of the UK, Vittorio Orlando of Italy, Georges Clemenceau of France, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States. They come to the Paris Peace Conference with very different outlooks of what the peace should look like."
Social Studies,"We already learned about President Wilson's ""Fourteen Points"". It was very idealistic. It talked about making the world safe for democracy, how people should determine their own fate, how we should have the self-determination, the end of empires, free trade, creating a League of Nations so that you can avoid things like World War I again. The European side was not quite as idealistic, especially the French. As you can imagine, the U.S."
Social Studies,"lost a lot of soldiers in World War I, but the French lost a significant fraction of their adult males in World War I. The ugly western front was fought in their country, so they were much more eager to make Germany pay for what it's done. The terms of the treaty with Germany, the Treaty of Versailles, and the Treaty of Versailles, it's important to note, is only one of several treaties that came out of the Paris Peace Conference."
Social Studies,"It tends to get the most attention because it was a treaty with Germany, Treaty of Versailles, and many people blame it for being part of the cause for World War II. It so humiliated Germany that it was so unacceptable, that it allowed a character like Hitler to come along and lead Germany back into war. The Treaty of Versailles was the treaty with Germany ."
Social Studies,"You have other treaties; with the Austrians and now since the Austro-Hungarian empire is being broken up, the Hungarians, the Ottomans, so on and so forth. The Treaty of Versailles did several things. First, this was kind of in line especially with the French-thinking, is it assigned the guilt to Germany ... So war guilt. War guilt for Germany. And depending on where you view, you could view this as a fairly strong thing."
Social Studies,"The argument for saying Germany is responsible for the war is in late July, early August of 1914, it didn't take much for Germany to declare war on Russia, then on France, and then invade Belgium. This was literally a matter of days. It was pretty clear that Germany was already mobilized to do this, it was eager to do this, and it did do this without much provocation. At that point, it was really just based on Russian mobilization."
Social Studies,"Those who would argue this was a little strong, would say Germany definitely played a role in the war, in maybe escalating the war, but it didn't start the war. You have the assassination of the Archduke of Franz Ferdinand, of Austro-Hungary. It was supported by elements in Serbia. Then you have the Austro-Hungarians who put out these very hard terms to the Serbians, bring these people to justice immediately, otherwise we're declaring war. It seemed like they wanted to declare war."
Social Studies,"They do declare war in July of 1914. The Russians, they don't let that be a little regional conflict, the Russians decide to start mobilizing, giving the Germans the pretext to justify their invasions, to kind of trigger this blank check that they've given the Austro-Hungarians. There's a lot of blame that could go around, but the Treaty of Versailles places it with Germany. This justifies the rationale to make Germany pay for the war. This leads to reparations ..."
Social Studies,"Reparations for Germany, which is essentially is like, ""Look, Germany, you don't have to pay the ally powers for all of their lost, especially their losses to their economy due to the fact that you are guilty of starting of this war guilt."" The reparations were not just in paper currency, the reparations were in gold, in resources. It was a very tangible reparations. It's an interesting question because these reparations are often referred to when people talked to, these were disabling reparations."
Social Studies,"They brought the German economy down. It is an open question. They were large. In modern dollars, the estimates I've seen, they were approximately $400 billion in 2013 money. That is a very, very large number, but it's not a huge number for a reasonably-sized economy like Germany. Although the economy was in bad shape at the end of World War I. It's not clear whether it by itself would have debilitated their economy."
Social Studies,"More likely, or if you were to think it's a cause, it's more the humiliation of it, that generations of Germans, many of them; 10, 20, 30 years in the future, had nothing to do with World War I, would be continuing to pay reparations to the allies. So there's a question of its impact on the economy and there's just the question of how humiliating it was. As we go, the reparations only last for about 10 years and Germany pays the equivalent of about $60 billion in modern terms, $60 billion in 2013 dollars."
Social Studies,"That's equivalent to about $5 billion in 1920 money. On top of the reparations, the allies were not interested in fighting another war with Germany, although ironically, by having very harsh terms of the treaty, they might have triggered the next war in World War II, The Rise of Hitler. Since they didn't want to have another war with Germany, they essentially limited the German army to 100,000 men, which is a very small army, as we've seen in many of the battles."
Social Studies,"You had battles with 400,000 or 500,000 men, so this is pretty much just like a police force, it's not really an army. They weren't allowed any longer to have submarines, U-boats, any kind of heavy military equipment, artillary, heavy artillary, military airplanes, battleships of any kind. It was really just a scaffold of an army so that there wouldn't be another, or they hoped there would not be, another German invasion. On top of that, Germany was stripped of territory. ... Territory ..."
Social Studies,"Some of that was directly in Germany. Poland was carved out of part of the German empire. This is the new Poland that's carved out out of the Paris Peace Conference. You see right over here, it cuts Germany into two pieces. East Prussia is still part of Germany, but it's all by itself right out here. Poland is cut out, Germany loses Alsace-Lorraine, which it captured in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian war. Mineral-rich region, the French had been eager to get it back."
Social Studies,"The Germans, actually that was one of their arguable justification why they wanted to premptively attack France, because they knew that France was eager to capture it back at some point in the future. On top of that, Germany lost its colonies. Germany was nowhere near as big of an empire as the British or even the French, it was actually a fairly new country formed in 1871, but it did have an empire."
Social Studies,"It had colonies in southwest Africa, I'll do this in darker colors, actually throughout Africa and had colonies in the Pacific. It even had a colony in China. All of that was then given over to the allies. The big idea, from the Treaty of Versailles, is that, most historians would say it was really kind of sticking it to the Germans. The Germans felt it was humilating and one could argue that it led to some of the extremism that we'll see in the next few decades of Germany."
Social Studies,"The one win that Woodrow Wilson was able to get out the Treaty of Versailles, is it did set up the League of Nations. The League of Nations. The irony here is that the US does not ratify the Treaty of Versailles because it's suspicious of these kind of extra national organizations. It actually wasn't happy with some of the territorial distribution, that it was just giving it from empire to another as opposed to having self-determination."
Social Studies,"The US was not actually a signatory, it did not actually sign the treaty. It did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Regardless of that, the Treaty of Versailles had a huge impact in sticking it to the Germans."
Social Studies,"On top of that, the Paris Peace Conference, as we've already said, had various treaties with the other central powers and some of the, and I'm not going to go into detail on what happened, especially the Ottoman Empire, that's worth another video, but the big effect on the Austro-Hungarian Empire is that it essentially is not an empire anymore. It was split up into various countries. Austria was set up as a separate country."
Social Studies,"Actually the Treaty of Versailles, in the Treaty of Versailles, Germany is forbidden from in any way merging with Austria, a German-speaking country. You have Hungary becoming a separate state. You have a new state of Czechoslovakia. You have a new state of Yugoslavia. All of a sudden, the trigger of World War I, the desire of having this unified southern Slavik state is now becoming a reality. You have Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia ... and Slovenia are taken out of the Austro-Hungarian empire."
Social Studies,"You have a major redrawing of the map of Europe. Some of these new nations here in eastern Europe are out of the old Russian empire. They were able to declare their independence, some of it short-lived before becoming satellite states or becoming part of the USSR, but they had their short-lived independence after the fall of the Russian empire."
Social Studies,"The map of Europe is dramatically changed due to the Paris Peace Conference, the Treaty of Versailles, the fall of the Russian empire, the other treaties that were outcomes of World War I.."
Social Studies,"Russia had already mobilized, but then the counter-counter-argument, well Germany gave a blank check to Austria, said it would back up Austria no matter what Austria had done. Needless to say, this applied a lot of, the Germans were not happy about being assigned the full blame of war guilt."
Social Studies,"On top of that, we've already talked about the notion that it really diminished the Treaty of Versailles, really forced the German military to be diminished dramatically down to 100,000 troops, which is really now more of a glorified police force. It was also forbidden from forming a union with Austria. You might say why Austria in particular? Well, Austria is a German-speaking state."
Social Studies,"You could imagine there's a lot of ethnic affinity or linguistic affinity between Germany and Austria, so this is not allowed according to the Treaty of Versailles. On top of that, Germany loses its colonies. These colonies we've already talked about. These are colonies in Africa, colonies in Asia and colonies in the Pacific. On top of that, we have the reparations. We have the reparations estimated at the equivalent in 2013 terms of about $450 billion US dollars."
Social Studies,"That doesn't get fully paid, but it still has a huge toll on the German economy, especially because the reparations were not just paid in currency, they were paid in resources. To make sure that they were paid in resources, the allies actually occupied the Saar region, the Saar region right over here which was coal rich, and for the next 15 years, it would ship coal to France. The allies weren't just getting paid in currency, they were getting paid in dollars."
Social Studies,"This would also have the effect as Weimar Germany, the Weimar Republic, this is the government of Germany after World War I, called the Weimar Republic because its constitution was drafted in the city of Weimar. In order to try to pay the currency portions of the reparations, left the printing presses go free, tries to convert into other currencies, and then you essentially have hyperinflation in Germany through the early '20s, through 1923."
Social Studies,"On top of that, once this hyperinflation happened and they no longer can pay the reparations, then in order to continue to extract resources from Weimar Germany, France goes ahead and occupies the Ruhr region, which is right about here. It's also very rich in steel and coal, and they began shipping the resources out which was another huge humiliation for the Germans and on top of that, it's crippling the German economy. They're taking all of the main resources out of the German economy."
Social Studies,"This happened in 1923 as well. The combined effect of one, just the humiliation of World War I, the shipping away of resources, now this occupation of the Ruhr region which was never even part of the already bad Treaty of Versailles, from the German's point of view, this helped bring support for fairly more and more extreme parties in Germany."
Social Studies,"As you go into the end of 1923, it gave some energy for Hitler's, at the time fairly small national socialist or their Nazis, to attempt a coup d'etat of the government, attempt their Beer Hall Putsch. It ends up failing, but does give a lot of energy to what was before a very marginalized, or very small party, because of this occupation, it allows that party to grow by a significant amount. On top of that, let's talk about the actual territorial losses, all of the territorial losses."
Social Studies,"You have this little region up here, the north part of east Prussia, at first becomes a French protector according to the Treaty of Versailles, but it's later taken over by Lithuania. We've already talked about this whole region of Germany, of the former German empire that's carved away in order to give it to the new state of Poland. Most of Poland is carved out of the former Russian empire, part is carved out of the former German empire and also part is carved out of the former Austro-Hungarian empire."
Social Studies,"Then you have this region right here inside [Lejon], part of it goes to Poland, part of it goes to Czechoslovakia. You have the famous Alsace Lorraine region right over here, had been a cause of contention between Germany and France for many, many, many years. Now this goes back to France. You have a little piece right over here that goes to Belgium, and then you have the north [slushig] region, goes to Denmark."
Social Studies,"On top of that, as you can imagine, the diminished troops, the taking resources away, France really wanted to cripple Germany's ability to be able to invade at any future point in time, but on top of that, they also set up a demilitarized zone in the Rhineland. The Rhineland is included both ... The demilitarized zone included the west bank of the Rhine River, all of Germany that was west of the Rhine River, so this entire region right over here, and then it was also occupied by the allies."
Social Studies,"Germany was also forbidden from militarizing or mobilizing troops anywhere 50 km east of the Rhine River. East of the Rhine River as well. So, you see going out of Treaty of Versailles, every attempt was made to attempt to cripple Germany's war-making abilities. They were forbidden from trading in arms and they couldn't have a lot of many types of offensive weapons. It really was to try to prevent Germany from being able to do what they did in World War I."
Social Studies,"As we see, in a large degree, it really was maybe a catalyst for giving energy to more extreme elements in Germany and would be one of the things pointing to for Germany's involvement in World War II.."
Social Studies,"The British also had Kuwait as a protectorate and this is from the 1800's and they don't get their independence until 1961. We also know that the British were eager to get the help of the Arab's, to essentially convince the Arab's to revolt against the Ottoman's so that they could successfully fight the Ottoman's on the Sinai and Palestine fronts and on the Mesopotamia front."
Social Studies,"In particular, they tried to convince this gentleman, Hussein bin Ali, who at the time, at the beginning of World War I is the Sharif of Mecca. In order to convince him they made promises to him. We have a whole video on the McMahon-Hussein correspondence. They say look if you help up us we will give you and independent state, an independent Arab state that would include all of this territory except for maybe, except for maybe this region right up here."
Social Studies,"So, with those British assurances he agrees to commit his forces to fight in the Arab revolt, to rise up and to help the British. From that point on in 1916 where you have the Arab revolt, he declares himself as the King of the Hejaz. Just as a little bit of a geography tangent right over here, this is the Hejaz. It's kind of the west coast of the Arabian peninsula and it contains the very influential towns of Mecca and Medina."
Social Studies,"You might say, well whatever happened to the Hejaz? Isn't all of this region right now Saudi Arabia? And you are correct. What happened shortly after, so in 1916 he declares himself King of the Hejaz but then you had another group, the Saudi's in the Nejd region, which is this area right over here. They are able to, in 1925, successfully, successfully, successfully conquer the Nejd and you have Ibn Saud who declares himself King of the Nejd and Hejaz from 1926 to 1932."
Social Studies,"He later merges them into Saudi Arabia and he's the first King of Saudi Arabia all the way until 1953. That's how you get Saudi Arabia. Now, let's continue, let's rewind back to World War I. You have the Arab revolt. Hussein bin Ali declares himself the King of the Hejaz. Two of his sons are very active in collaborating with the British to fight against the Ottoman's. This right over here is Faisal bin Hussein. Bin Hussein literally means son of Hussein. This right over here is Abdullah."
Social Studies,"By the end of the war, and we covered this in the Sinai, Palestine and Mesopotamia Campaigns, the combined British and Arab forces are able to move all the way into, all the way into what is now northern Syria. They're all able to move into what is now northern Iraq. You can imagine at this point, the Arab's are eager in a post world environment to have their state. The reason why they're a little bit unceratin about their future is based on what some of the things that came out during the war."
Social Studies,We now know that while the British were trying to convince Hussein bin Ali to get his forces to rise up against the Ottoman's they were dealing with the French in the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement to essentially carve up this whole territory between the British and the French. They really weren't talking about independent states for the Arab's.
Social Studies,"A few years later in 1917, this was still during the war, while the war was happening, you have the Balfour Declaration, which declared the British intent to create a homeland for the Jewish people. Then a month later, really the end of that month, November 1917, the Russian's make the Sykes-Picot Agreement public, so all of these things made the Arab's very uneasy. They got assurances from the British that oh that wasn't that serious of an agreement, just keep fighting with us."
Social Studies,"So, at the end of the war they were eager to get, what they thought, was their just claim. So you have Faisal bin Hussein, he attends the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. (writing) So in 1919 you have the Paris, Paris Peace Conference and just to be clear at that point in time it wasn't obvious that you necessarily had to have this, what we now have, is this conflict between what is now Israel and the Arab people."
Social Studies,"Faisal bin Hussein was actually eager to kind of reach out to the World Zionist Organization, to the Zionist movement to hopefully get their help in establishing an independent Arab state. He didn't think that they would, that it would establish an independent Jewish state, but he said hey look if they can have a homeland here but in order to get that homeland, they're willing to support me for an independent Arab state then I might kind of send out an olive branch to them."
Social Studies,"This right over here is a quote by Faisal bin Hussein. This is while he was trying to get support for an independent Arab state, one that he would argue, was promised to him by the McMahon Correspondences with his father. So, this is Faisal. ""We Arabs, look with the deepest sympathy ""on the Zionist movement. ""Our deputation here in Paris is fully ""acquainted with the proposal submitted yesterday ""by the Zionist Organization to the Peace Conference ""and we regard them as moderate and proper."
Social Studies,"""We will do our best, in so far as we are concerned ""to help them through, we will wish the Jews ""a most hearty welcome home."
Social Studies,"""I look forward, and my people with me look forward ""to a future in which we will help you and you will ""help us so that the countries in which we are ""mutually interested may once again take their ""places in the community of the civilized peoples ""of the world."" But he did throw in this caveat, he was doing this because he wanted their support for an independent state and he did throw in the caveat, look this only applies, I'm only supportive, essentially, of the Balfour Declaration if we get our independent state."
Social Studies,"He really wanted ... he really wanted an independent, (writing) independent state. He explicitly said, hey look if we don't get an independent state all the stuff I said here, doesn't really apply. So you end of with the Treaty of Sev in 1920. It turns out that the Sykes-Picot Agreement held a lot more weight than the assurances between McMahon and Hussein because in the Treaty of Sev, this area was divided, essentially, according to the Sykes-Picot Agreement."
Social Studies,"Up here, this whole region was given to France, they called it a mandate, which is essentially it was allowed to be occupied by France but they called it a mandate. The allies wanted it to be called a mandate so it didn't look like France was getting something. A mandate is kind of, hey you have to come help these people to transition them to establish a state, to help them transition institutions so eventually they can get independence."
Social Studies,"The allies wanted it to appear that, look central powers, look Ottoman's, you're not giving us something, you're not giving us this territory, you're giving us a responsibility. Needless to say, they were eager to occupy this territory, so eager that when Faisal bin Hussein, in 1920, declared himself King of Syria, they booted him out. He was in really no power to contest that booting out."
Social Studies,"This area right over here, this was pretty much in line with the Sykes-Picot Agreement, became a British, this whole area right over here became a British mandate. Now, in what is now Iraq, you essentially have an uprising in 1920, they don't appreciate, they thought that they were going to become independent now. They were free of the Ottoman's, but now all of a sudden the British come and say that they are in charge. So you have this revolt against the British in 1920."
Social Studies,"The British start to realize, gee this is kind of expensive trying to keep control of this maybe we should install someone, and we'll still kind of keep this as a protectorate as a mandated territory, but why don't we install someone, an Arab leader, as the King of this region. So, the install Faisal bin Hussein as a King of Iraq. He is a King of Iraq, essentially under protection, or under influence of the British from 1921 until 1933 and that's when they finally get independence of the British, in 1932."
Social Studies,"When they get booted out of Syria, his brother Abdullah, son of Hussein bin Ali, he's allowed to become King of trans Jordan. They later get independence in 1946 after World War II at which point he becomes the King of Jordan. Syria and Lebanon, they don't get independence until during or after World War II. Lebanon gets independence in 1943, Syria gets independence from the French in 1946."
Social Studies,"And we know that the mandate of Palestine, which the British kept, this would continue to be a sore point through World War II and then with the establishment of the state of Israel shortly afterwards, it becomes a very, I guess we could say, hot point in international affairs.."
Social Studies,"And by most accounts, this is where he finds meaning. He finds meaning in being part of the military. He finds meaning in frankly, the war itself. But then in 1918, we, of course, have the end of the war. Well, first you have the abdication of the Kaiser. You have the Republican government, people who want to form a republic, take control. And then they sign an armistice with the Allies in November. And this is not well received by Hitler. And frankly, it's not well received by many in the military."
Social Studies,"From their point of view, they somewhat delusionally believed that Germany would have won World War I if they weren't stabbed in the back by these November Criminals, by the folks who had taken over after the Kaiser. So you have this whole stab in the back theory by those who had taken over and signed the armistice. And this wasn't just believed by folks like Hitler. This was believed even by very senior people in the military."
Social Studies,"This right over here is General Ludendorff, one of two people-- the other gentleman, Hindenburg-- who were in charge of the entire German military. He believed in the stab in the back theory. He thought that they would have won if they didn't sign the armistice, if these November Criminals, these people who had taken control of the government, did not sign this with the Allies. And then you go to 1919. From the point of view of people of like Hitler, things only got worse."
Social Studies,"You have the Treaty of Versailles that applied all the war guilt to the Germans. You have these huge reparations that would even be paid in resources. You have the former German Empire, a significant amount of its territory is given over to the Allies, or to form new states. Then, you also have the formal establishment of the Weimar Republic. It's called the Weimar Republic because the new German constitution is drafted in the town of Weimar. And it sets it up as a parliamentary democracy."
Social Studies,"That's why it's called a republic. But it's a little bit of a bizarre parliamentary democracy. It actually gave a good bit of power, a directly elected president that had a reasonable amount of power, especially in emergencies. And that would become relevant later on when Hitler actually comes to power over a decade later. But then in 1919, Hitler was still looking-- he was very upset about the war ending. He stays part of the military."
Social Studies,"And part of the military he's assigned to start infiltrating or spying on the German Workers' Party. And the acronym in German is the DAP. But the English translation would be the German Workers' Party. But he actually gets quite impressed by the German Workers' Party, which is really ultra-nationalist. And when we talk about ultra-nationalist it's all about German race superiority. It's in line with this whole idea that they would have won the war if they weren't stabbed in the back."
Social Studies,"And it's also anti-communist. It's anti-capitalist. And it's anti ethnic minorities, in particular anti-Jewish. And all of these ideas Hitler found very impressive. And just to be clear, a lot of times when people talk about ultra-nationalist groups they often will call them as ultra-right wing. And this bears some clarification because the right wing is also often viewed as very capitalist."
Social Studies,"But ultra-nationalists really put the nation, and the race that they view as indicative of the nation, above all other concerns. So yes, they were anti-communist. They were anti-distribution of wealth. Communists believe in no classes, as little private property as possible. The German Workers' party didn't believe in that. They were anti that. But they were also anti unfettered capitalism, especially capitalism that might get in the way of the nation's interests. But he becomes very impressed with them."
Social Studies,"And he actually joins as the 55th member. So you can imagine, this, at this point, is a very, very small party. But then we fast forward to 1920. By 1920, the party leadership has taken note of Hitler. They actually notice him when he's arguing with people and that other people are listening. He's actually a really great orator. And so they allow him to give more and more talks. He has more and more authority."
Social Studies,"And in order for the party to have more of an appeal, especially to nationalists in general, they change their name. To German Workers' Party they add the Nationalist Socialist German Workers' Party, DAP, German Workers' Party, or the NSDAP. And if you pronounce nationalist in German, it sounds something like-- and I'm going to butcher it right now-- Nazionalist. And so, if you were to shorten it, they called themselves the Nazis."
Social Studies,"And Hitler actually designed the logo for the Nazis, which included this symbol right over here, the swastika. And the swastika is worth talking about because it was really this bizarre corruption of a very ancient symbol. Hitler and the Nazis created this entire mythology around the Germans being the descendants of the Aryans, or being the purest example of the Aryans. And the Aryans are the superior race that's responsible for all of civilization's advancement."
Social Studies,"It was a delusion because frankly, there was an ancient Aryan race. But the most indicative descendants of them are frankly, the Persians or the Indians. And actually, the swastika symbol here, you might actually even see it at a Hindu temple. It does not mean all of what we associate with Nazism now. It actually is an ancient Hindu symbol of auspiciousness, of good luck. But the Nazis usurped it."
Social Studies,"But for them, this was a very important idea to create this mythology around race superiority and to even have a symbol like this as opposed to say something like a cross that's a religious symbol. Anyone could believe in Christianity and say, hey, I'm a Christian. But the swastika, at least in Hitler's mind and the Nazi's mind, was a racial symbol. So it represented their superior race."
Social Studies,"And obviously, if their race was superior, a lot of what they consider the ills of Germany were caused by being infiltrated with what they considered less pure races, like Jews, and also infiltrated with less pure ideas, like the ideas of communism. But Hitler gets more and more recognition with the party. The party membership continues to grow. And by 1921, you have some disagreements in the party. Some people threatened to splinter off."
Social Studies,"And when Hitler says, hey look, if this is going to happen, I'm going to leave the party, they realize that he has so much value to the party that the party would just dissolve if Hitler leaves. And so they make him the chairman. Hitler takes control. Hitler is the chairman of the Nazi party. And by this point, he's becoming more and more well known on the speaking circuit. And we now have several thousand members of the Nazi party. Although, it's still a fairly small group."
Social Studies,"But then, things start to get a lot worse in Weimar, Germany. You start having hyperinflation. The government keeps printing more and more currency. The economy is weak. It's trying to pay reparations. And so what you have here-- and this is actually one of the most famous cases of hyperinflation in world history-- you see the value of their currency, it devalues from 1919 to 1923 not by a factor of 1,000 or a million or a billion, but nearly a trillion. So the currency becomes, frankly, worthless."
Social Studies,"The hyperinflation is happening this entire time. And you see, it accelerates through 1922 and then 1923. But then in 1922, you have Mussolini comes to power in Italy. And he comes to power through his March on Rome. And Mussolini is a fascist. That's where the word comes from. He's a member of the Fascist Party. And the Fascists' ideas were very similar to the Nazis. It was all about extreme nationalism, all about racial superiority, a very strong government. And this Hitler finds quite inspiring."
Social Studies,"The Weimar Republic is having economic difficulty. You have many other groups, including the communists, attempt their own coup d'etats. They fail. But things are getting less and less stable. And then you fast forward to 1923. The inflation is getting super bad, about as bad as inflation can get. The currency is worthless. The economy is going into a tailspin. And on top of that, because Germany can't pay the reparations to France anymore, France occupies the Ruhr."
Social Studies,"So the Ruhr region is occupied by France. And you might remember from the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the Saar region was already being occupied. And all that coal was being shipped out to France. The Ruhr region was another significant region of coal and steel production. And now the French are fully occupying this. They're forcing a lot of the civilians out of the region. They're forcing a lot of the workers to work in the mines and the factories."
Social Studies,"And then they're shipping all of that supply out to France. So this further debilitates the economy, but it's a huge humiliation. The Treaty of Versailles, in the minds of Germans, especially in the minds of nationalists, was bad enough. But now you have this huge humiliation by the French. And this isn't just amongst the nationalists. The general German population is getting very, very, very, very upset about this. And so this gives a lot of fuel to extreme nationalist groups, like the Nazis."
Social Studies,"So this fuels the Nazis. And based on the estimates I've seen, entering into the year they're starting to have in excess of 10,000 members, starting to be several tens of thousands. And as we get into the later part of the year, we're approaching, I've seen estimates of 40,000 to 55,000 members of the Nazi party. And that's just formal members. And then on top of that, you might have non-members who are growing increasingly sympathetic."
Social Studies,"And so what we'll see in the next video, at the end of 1923, Hitler sees this as his chance. He's inspired by Mussolini, the economy is in a tailspin, the Germans have been further humiliated by the French, and the Nazis, in particular, are starting to get quite popular.."
Social Studies,"It isn't just regular people who are starting to support the Nazis, it's very notable people as well. This right over here is General Ludendorff, we've already talked about him, he's one of the believers in the 'stab-in-the-back' theory that Germany would have won World War I if it wasn't stabbed in the back by the November Criminals who had taken control of the government during the revolution in October and November. He becomes a supporter of Hitler as well."
Social Studies,"In 1922 you have Mussolini come to power, this inspires Hitler. So, as we get in to November, Hitler sees this as his chance and the way that he wants to take control, is he wants to abduct or kidnap the leaders of the Bavarian region, and there's three of them, in particular at this time. Then from there, try to take control of the nation as a whole."
Social Studies,"So, in November of 1923 you have a gathering of the three gentlemen who are essentially in charge of Bavaria, a gathering of them and several thousand officials in Bavaria at a local beer hall in Munich. (writing) at a beer hall. Hitler sees this as the opportunity to take control. This is where he launches his Beer Hall Putsch, and I know I'm mispronouncing it, but Putsch literally means coup d'état, to try to overthrow the government."
Social Studies,"So, Hitler and his Nazi's the go to that Beer Hall meeting of the government officials, they surround it with their paramilitary group, their storm troopers, Hitler enters into the hall, gets on stage, shoots into the air twice and says, look this is the revolution, it is beginning. He forces the three leaders of Bavaria at gunpoint to pledge allegiance to the Nazi party and to this Putsch and to Hitler, in particular. Then things start to go a little bit ... get a little bit ... start to dissolve."
Social Studies,"As Hitler tries to address some issues that are going on outside, the members who they were going to kidnap are allowed to leave, you have chaos in the area amongst the Nazi's and, frankly, amongst the government throughout that evening, into that morning, at which point Hitler and his followers, and Ludendorff is one of them, decide to march (writing) decide to march into central Munich. All of this is happening ... all of this is happening in Munich, which is in Bavaria."
Social Studies,"They decide to march, and it's during that march that they have a confrontation with the official government troops. It's unclear who fired the first shot, but you do have an exchange of fire and during that exchange of fire, I've seen estimates of about 14-16 Nazi's are shot. A few days later ... and a few policemen, or a few soldiers are shot as well, and then a few days later Hitler is arrested. (writing) Hitler, Hitler is arrested."
Social Studies,"He's tried in early 1924 and then he is sentenced to jail, so all of his ambitions were lead to nothing. In jail, he still continued to develop his philosophy. He actually continued to develop his following. He spent roughly the second two-thirds of 1924, in 1924, he spent it in jail."
Social Studies,"(writing) 1924 was spent primarily in jail, but while he was in jail he had dictated his autobiography and his, frankly, his belief system in Mein Kampf, which literally means 'My struggle.' It's actually banned in many countries, it's not banned in the U.S. It does make for interesting reading because you get a sense for, on one level, how bizarre Hitler's brain was and how disturbed Hitler's brain was, but on the other side, you can appreciate that he was a very, he was a strong communicator."
Social Studies,"Even before any of this people would talk about how transfixing his eyes were, how much attention people paid to him when he would give a speech. You can even see this in his writing, and you can do a web search on it and you can get the entire text of Mein Kampf. It's disturbing and fascinating at the same time, but this is a little passage."
Social Studies,"In this passage, it gives you an idea of Hitler's view of why Germany was having these failures and what he, in his bizarrely disturbed mind, thought what the solution was. ""If we pass all the causes of the German collapse ""in review, the ultimate and most decisive ""remains the failure to recognize the racial problem, ""and especially the Jewish menace."" He's blaming all of Hitler's difficulty on a racial problem and in particular on Jews."
Social Studies,"""The defeats on the battlefield in August 1918 ""would have been child's play to bear. ""They stood in no proportion to the victories ""of our people."
Social Studies,"""It was not they that cause our downfall, ""no, it was brought about by that power which ""prepared these defeats by systematically, ""over many decades, robbing our people of ""the political and moral instincts and forces ""which alone make nations capable, ""and hence worthy of existence."" If you read a lot of the other text, what he's talking about is this decades of, essentially, watering down their society, watering down their society with other people."
Social Studies,"If they didn't water it down, they say the defeats in the battlefield would've been child's play to bear. ""In heedlessly ignoring the question ""of the preservation of the racial foundations of our ""nation, the old Reich disregarded the sole right ""which gives life in this world."" He views this racial, in his mind, racial impurity as the reason why Germany was facing all of this difficulty. As we'll see over the next few videos, this leads to one of the ugliest and bloodiest periods of human history.."
Social Studies,"They had issued new currency, it was far more stable. To a certain degree the Nazi's and Hitler were starting from scratch, although even at this point Hitler continues to be an ever growing influence. He's a famous speaker, there are more and more people who are knowing about him and who are following him."
Social Studies,"Over the next few years his book does get published and it sells, actually, tens of thousands of copies over the next several years, but for the most part he's still a relatively small actor in German politics. But then we fast forward as we get to the late 20s, the Nazi's are gaining some influence, but then in 1929, (writing) in 1929, you have a global change for the economy of the world and that's the beginning of The Great Depression."
Social Studies,"In particular, what's often the first sign that The Great Depression was at hand is you have the U.S. stock market crashes in October of 1929, famous Black Tuesday. That was the mark of the beginning of a, not just American Depression, but a global depression. So you have the whole world going into a depression."
Social Studies,"Anytime you have economic turmoil it tends give more energy to the more extreme parties, whether it is the parties like the Nazi's, who one could consider maybe to be on the extreme right, or often considered to be on the extreme right, or maybe you could say very nationalistic, or even the extreme left parties who are obviously against capitalist systems and whatever else. So, by the election of 1930, now we're talking about Parliamentary elections and the Parliament in Germany is the Reichstag."
Social Studies,"(writing) The Reichstag, and I know I'm mispronouncing it. In the Reichstag elections, the Nazi party, for the first time is able to have a significant showing. It gets 18, it gets roughly 18% of the vote and a proportional representation in the Parliament. Now all of a sudden, this kind of marks the beginning of the Nazi's being significant, significant players in German politics. Then we get to 1932 and the economy is not improving, it is only getting worse. (writing) 1932."
Social Studies,"Adolf Hitler actually makes a run for President. The current President at that point is Paul von Hindenburg, famous for the Hindenburg line, later for the Hindenburg, the Zeppelin, the famous exploding Zeppelin disaster. He was, with Ludendorff, one of the two leaders of the German military effort during World War I. He's President of the Weimar Republic since 1925 and in 1932 he is able to get re-election, but Hitler has a fairly good showing. Hitler is able to get 35% of the vote."
Social Studies,"(writing) Hitler gets 35% of the presidential election votes, (writing) of the vote. The Weimar Republic had this strange system. It wasn't quite a Presidential system like the U.S. and it wasn't quite a pure Parliamentary system like the current-day Germany. The President was independently elected and had some powers, and then the Parliament was also independently elected and then they would try to build coalitions to have a ruling government."
Social Studies,"Needless to say, 1932 Hitler is now a major actor, the Nazi's also have a many, many, many seats in Parliament. Now, you have several Parliamentary elections as well in 1932 and as we just talked about two in particular. In order for a government to form in Parliament, in order to find the Cabinet and the Chancellor, who essentially is the Prime Minister, you have an election and the different parties get different amounts of votes."
Social Studies,"If no party has a majority, the parties have to form a coalition that can make a majority. There's a lot of horsetrading going on with parties negotiating, hey why don't we form a coalition with each other, if we do that maybe someone from my party can be Minister of the Interior, someone of your party could be the Chancellor and maybe we can get a coalition together to rule over the government. But you have two Parliamentary elections and no majority coalition forms. (writing) So, two, two elections."
Social Studies,"So this is Parliamentary. So this is in the Presidential election, Hindenburg is still President, but Hitler has a good showing and then you have two Parliamentary elections. (writing) Parliament elections, or Reichstag elections where you have no majority, no coalition. (writing) no majority, majority coalition. The Nazi's continue to be a major actor here, they continue to have more and more of a showing inside the Reichstag. Then by 1933 it's a bit of crisis."
Social Studies,"So as we get in to early 1933 we have a little bit of a crisis. We have no government, we have no Chancellor, we have no Cabinet to essentially be the executive, the government of the country because there's been no major coalitions. The Weimar Constitution allowed a strange thing, it allowed the President to appoint a government, appoint a Cabinet, a Chancellor that might not even be representative of what's going on in Parliament. So, Paul von Hindenburg is convinced that ..."
Social Studies,"hey look, he was no fan, he was no fan of Adolf Hitler but he's convinced that look, Adolf Hitler was your opponent if you make Adolf Hitler the head of an interim Government, the head of an interim Cabinet then that might be a way to create some national unity and then maybe we could have some Parliamentary elections that there can be a majority coalition and you could have, I guess you could say, a more legitimate government take hold."
Social Studies,"So, Paul von Hindenburg is convinced and so he does, even though the Nazi's are still a minority party, even though they weren't part of any type of a majority coalition, Paul von Hindenburg who is not a fan of Adolf Hitler appoints him as Chancellor. This is in January. So in January, Hitler, (writing) Hitler is appointed Chancellor, Chancellor, which is essentially the Prime Minister of the Reichstag of Germany. Then we get to February and events get really, really, really interesting."
Social Studies,"In February of 1933 you have a fire in the Reichstag building in Berlin. This is the Reichstag building right over here and it is on fire. They find this gentleman here on the scene, Marinus van der Lubbe, he is a Dutch communist. It is essentially the blame is placed as this was some type of a, the beginning of some type of a communist revolution. This is used as a pretext."
Social Studies,"Hitler then advises Paul von Hindenburg to essentially use some of his emergency powers as President, which is another strange thing that the Weimar Constitution allowed for, it allowed the President under emergency conditions to start to suspend civil rights. This was an emergency situation and so Paul von Hindenburg does that. He essentially issues ... once you have the Reichstag fire (writing) Reichstag fire, and then Hindenburg is convinced by the Nazi's to pass the Reichstag Fire Decree."
Social Studies,"(writing) Fire decree, which essentially suspends, it gives the government emergency powers and it suspends civil liberties, which everything up to this point now is actually legal, this was actually allowed for in the Weimar Constitution. (writing) Suspends, suspends civil, civil liberties."
Social Studies,"And since there's no coalition, the whole point that Hitler's Cabinet was going to be an interim one, you have another Parliamentary election coming in March with the hope of maybe a majority coalition forms, but that March election, especially with civil liberties suspended you could imagine that the Nazi's ... and they have their paramilitary troopers started intimidating other parties, making sure that they had a better showing at the polls, they started intimidating other candidates."
Social Studies,"The March election start to swing hugely in the Nazi's favor, so in the March election they're able to get 44% of the vote, which is still not enough, by themselves, to form a government. It's still not a majority, but they're able now ... they're now the largest part in the Reichstag, in the Parliament. They're able to now form a majority coalition, and I guess you could say more legitimately ..."
Social Studies,"although this was a election of intimidation, they were able to now form a government, they're able to now form a government based on a majority coalition and Hitler remains Chancellor. But then, this new Parliament passes the Enabling Act in March."
Social Studies,"(writing) Enabling Act, Enabling Act, which is essentially an amendment to the Weimar Constitution which gives the Cabinet, especially the Chancellor, effectively the Chancellor who's the head of the Cabinet, legislative powers, unlimited legislative powers for the next four years. So, it gives legislative powers and remember we already have suspended civil rights."
Social Studies,"So, the Reichstag is essentially giving over the legislative powers, (writing) legislative powers, to the Chancellor who happens to be, who happens to be Hitler. There was some check on this by the President, but then we have Hindenburg dying the next year. After this, after the suspension of civil rights and then the Enabling Act shortly afterwards, Hitler is essentially in full control, Hitler and the Nazi's are essentially in full control of the German government."
Social Studies,"At this point, Hitler is the dictator, (writing) the dictator of, he is the dictator of Germany. They start to act fast, they start to intimidate other parties, they use violence, they start to imprison people and by July of 1933 ... so they're acting very, very fast, by July of 1933 Nazi's are the only legal party. (writing) only legal Pot party and they essentially have full control."
Social Studies,"Now, this is how Hitler came to power and the question that's probably circling in your mind is, ""Who did this fire?"" This fire was the catalyst, although Hitler was already Chancellor and maybe he would have found some way to get to power regardless, but this fire, even though there was evidence that it looked like maybe Marinus van der Lubbe did it, it was blamed on the communist, it was the pretext that was used to give the government even more power, especially the Nazi's even more power."
Social Studies,"This is an open question, one of those great open questions, one of those great open questions of history. Some people feel that maybe it was just a communist plot, maybe it was Marinus van der Lubbe acting on his own and maybe it just happened to fall into the hands of Hitler and they were able to use it, while other historians think that this was actually a plot by the Nazi's to create this emergency state and Marinus van der Lubbe was kind of a puppet in this whole plot."
Social Studies,"So, open question of history, but needless to say as we go from 1919 to 1933, Hitler goes from a fairly unknown individual to full dictator of Germany.."
Social Studies,"And so as we get into 1934 they continue to consolidate their power and now more directly start eliminating their opponents. And when I say eliminating, they are actually directly killing these individuals. And there is an entire Nazi power apparatus that is at play, but the three figures here are the ones that are most notable other than Hitler."
Social Studies,"This is Joseph Goebbels who is the head of Nazi Propaganda, Hermann Göring, who is the head of the Nazi's secret police, the Gestapo, which later goes under the control of the SS, under Heinrich Himmler. He is a major player in the rearmament of Germany for war footing. He eventually helds the Luftwaffe which is the German airforce during the World War II."
Social Studies,"We have Heinrich Himmler who is the head of Schutzstaffel, more famously known as the SS, which is the paramilitary group of the Nazi party, used to intimidate and eliminate (as we will see) their opponents and they are also responsible for the execution of the actual the planning and the execution - of the actual holocaust."
Social Studies,"And so as we get into 1934 Hitler is eager to eliminate more of his opponents - and we are not just talking about opponents outside of the Nazi party, we are also talking about rivals within the Nazi party. And the most notable of these was Ernst Röhm who as you see at this picture was clearly a Nazi."
Social Studies,"He was head of the Storm Battalion or the SA, which was the paramilitary group that the SS splintered out of and it was far more independent than Hitler would have liked and it was not popular amongst the German people because of its violence - and Hitler and his lieutenants viewed Röhm as a potential rival to Hitler's authority within the Nazi party."
Social Studies,"And so in 1934, June 30th in particular - or we could say June 30th to July 2nd - you have what's called the Night of the Long Knives and it really should be called the Nights of the Long Knives but the Night of the Long Knives, where under the pretext of a supposed a coup d'état or a putsch on the part of Ernst Röhm The SS and the Gestapo start rounding up Röhm, his allies and any perceived enemies of Hitler. Start rounding them up and eliminating them and shooting them..."
Social Studies,"And Ernst Röhm is arrested and when he refuses to kill himself in his jail cell he is shot at point-blank range. Gregor Strasser, who is a former rival of Hitler within the Nazi party, he is eliminated. Kurt von Schleicher who is a previous chancellor of Germany, perceived as a rival to Hitler - he and his wife are gunned down. Gustav Ritter von Kahr who is in no way anymore a rival to Hitler but he was one of the major actors for putting down the Beer Hall Putsch - the fail the Beer Hall Putch of 1923."
Social Studies,He is hacked - he is hacked to get dead. And these are just four of the more notable folks. On those few nights over 85 major officials in Germany were eliminated. And as we will see this is just the beginning of the consolidation of Nazi power and now they are doing it through extra legal means..
Social Studies,"They, in fact, were doing this as soon as they had taken power, in 1933. But now, they felt confident enough to publicly state their intention -- which is another way of publicly stating that they [could n't] care less about the Treaty of Versailles, which had said that Germany was limited to a 100,000-soldier military. Then, we get into 1936. 1936, you might remember -- another term of the Treaty of Versailles was that Germany was not allowed to occupy the Rhineland -- this area in yellow right over here."
Social Studies,"And then that was actually reaffirmed in 1925 by the Treaties of Locarno, where Germany, itself, agreed to not occupy the Rhineland. But by 1936, Hitler decides to ignore all of those, and occupies the Rhineland. But once again the allies -- The French are not so happy about this. The UK, in particular, once again, [was] not super happy about this. But they decided this is not reason to potentially start another war over. So they really don't push back on Germany."
Social Studies,"Then, we get into 1938, and German aggression really goes into full gear. In March of 1938, you have a coup d'état, orchestrated by the Nazis in Austria, that really overthrows the Austrian government and allows the Germans to unify the two countries. So, you have the Germans come into Austria -- really a bloodless takeover. And there was already popular support for the Nazis in Austria. There was a Nazi party in Austria."
Social Studies,"There had been popular sentiment for many years, amongst many Austrians, to possibly be unified with the Germans. Austria [was and] is, fundamentally, a German-speaking nation. And so in March, this actually happens. This 'Anschluss' -- or unification. And, if you remember, that was also another forbidden term of the Treaty of Versailles. So now, the Germans are pretty much ignoring the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of St."
Social Studies,"Germain, which was the equivalent of the Treaty of Versailles -- but with the Austrians. So, you have the unification of Germany and Austria. Then, as we get into late 1938 -- in September in particular -- Hitler and the Nazis are interested in bringing the German-speaking populations of Czechoslovakia under German control. And this region, right over here in magenta, this is where you have large populations of German speakers."
Social Studies,"These regions are collectively referred to as the 'Sudetenland.' And really, just continuing the policy of not wanting to rock the boat with Germany, you have France, Great Britain, and Italy agreeing -- And Italy was an ally of the Germans. But France and Great Britain, in particular, are not interested in rocking the boat with the Germans."
Social Studies,"And so, in September of 1938, they sign the Munich Agreement, which did not actually -- where they actually did not consult the Czechoslovakian government -- where they allowed Germany to take over this region right over here -- the Sudetenland."
Social Studies,"And that, frankly, with the Germans taking over this significant part of the population of Czechoslovakia, a significant part of the industrial capacity of Czechoslovakia, this eventually leads to early 1939, where all of what we would now consider the Czech Republic -- this area right over here, all [of] this -- becomes a protectorate of Germany. So, they call it the 'Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.' So, Bohemia and Moravia go to Germany. And, so this is 1939."
Social Studies,"So, [by] 1939, [we have seen this pattern repeat itself during the previous] four years -- Nazi Germany ignoring the Treaty of Versailles, by rearming, by occupying the Rhineland, by unifying with Austria. Now, they're expanding their territory. They are actively allowed to take over the German-speaking areas of Czechoslovakia, under the Munich agreement."
Social Studies,"And eventually, they're able to take over Bohemia and Moravia -- all of what we would currently call the 'Czech Republic.' And this general pattern of German aggression, [allowed] by the other powers in Europe essentially allowing it to happen -- and, in particular, Great Britain allowing it to happen -- has been referred to as a 'policy of appeasement.' Obviously, the word 'appeasement' means there is someone who is angry about something, and you just don't want to make them any angrier -- you just let them do whatever they want -- this is, essentially, what was happening over here."
Social Studies,"And in hindsight, it might be easy to say, ""Hey, look!. They were allowing Germany to take over more and more -- to become more aggressive, which made [Germany] more and more confident. And this would eventually lead to World War II."" But at the time, you do have to remember [that[ everyone still had a very strong memory of what had happened in World War I. And no one was interested in starting another [pan-European] war."
Social Studies,"And so, even [though] in hindsight, it's easy to say that the British -- in particular Neville Chamberlain, who was the Prime Minister from 1937 on -- were weak and allowed German[y] -- Hitler -- to gain confidence, which eventually led to the Nazi invasion of Poland in the fall of 1939. But it's easy to say that in hindsight. But what we see, as we get into 1939, is an aggressive Germany, a Germany that's not being checked by the other powers of Europe."
Social Studies,"And this is what eventually leads to September of 1939, where, actually, the Germans and the Soviets agree to partition Poland into their own spheres of influence, which allows Germany to invade Poland in early September [of] 1939 -- which is, you could kind of say, 'the straw that broke the camel's back,' and is the beginning of -- So, Poland invasion. The invasion of Poland. -- which is the beginning of World War II.."
Social Studies,"And the root of fascist and fascism come from the Italian word ""fascio,"" which literally refers to a bundle. It comes out of this idea that a bundle of things will be stronger together than individually. And this is actually the symbol for fascism. And this symbol of this bundle, this sheath of sticks, this actually predates Mussolini by thousands of years. It goes back to Roman times."
Social Studies,"And even, based on some of the things I've read, even predates Roman times as a symbol of unity, a symbol of official strength. And even before Mussolini came around, the term was used by many, many, many groups that viewed themselves as a league of revolutionaries. A group of people somehow fighting for change. And Mussolini was no different. When in the end of 1914 and then in early 1915, he establishes the Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria. And I'm, once again, so sorry for my butchering of an Italian word."
Social Studies,"But this literally translates to group action revolutionary, or you could say the revolutionary action group, founded by Mussolini in 1915. And it was really a splinter of the Socialist Party. Well, there's an irony there because Mussolini and fascism, in particular, is associated with strongly anti-socialist ideology. But as Europe was entering into World War I in 1914, some of the mainstream of the Italian Socialist Party was against Italy entering the war. They wanted Italy to maintain their neutrality."
Social Studies,"But you had splinter groups, more nationalist groups, that said, hey, look, this is Italy's chance to claim its right. It should join the war on the side of the Entente. And Mussolini was one of these individuals. And because of his strong pro-war stance, he was actually kicked out of his-- he was head of a socialist paper in 1914. And then he eventually, by 1915, establishes the Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria."
Social Studies,"And by the end of World War I, as we get into 1919, it regroups under the name Fasci Italiani di Combattimento. So this literally translates as, you could view Fasci as a group, or league, or revolutionary league of Italians of Combatants. Or the Combatant Italian Revolutionary Group-- I guess is one way to think about it-- or the Group of Italian Combatants, is another way to think about it. And their ideology-- and their ideology wasn't well established right when they set up."
Social Studies,"It was just really around this idea of being super pro-nationalist-- but it began to develop over the course of the '20s and the 1930s. The core idea, and I've already said it multiple times, is an extreme nationalism. And when we talk about extreme nationalism, or nationalism in general, it's talking about the interests of one nation, of one group, above all others. About putting the state above all other things. Oftentimes, fascism is viewed as a right-wing group."
Social Studies,"But in its purest form, it's neither left- or right-wing. At the left end of the spectrum, you could imagine communist or socialism. I'll write communism, which you could view as an extreme form of socialism. Communism. And at the extreme right, you could imagine just complete free-market. Complete, unfettered, free-market. Ultra small government. And fascists and extreme nationalists, they didn't view themselves as either end of the spectrum."
Social Studies,"They kind of viewed themselves as a separate way where everything was subordinate. The economy itself was subordinate to the state. Now with that said, they tended to align themselves more with folks on the right. So even though they weren't completely free-market capitalists, they were staunchly anti-communist and anti-socialist, which caused them to form alliances a little bit more with the right."
Social Studies,"But from their point of view, it wasn't one of these extreme right-wing ideologies that the government should be subordinate to the economy, that the government should be as small as possible. It was much more that the economy was there to serve national interests. Some of the other ideologies that the fascists began to hold is this idea that force was a legitimate part of politics. So force in politics."
Social Studies,"And you would see this when Benito Mussolini's fascists, through the use of the Black Shirts, which was their paramilitary group, which allowed them to eventually take political control and enforce political control. And we later see it with other groups like the Nazis. Who are also tended to be associated with fascism. And their storm troopers and their storm battalions, their paramilitary forces, that are used to, essentially, take political control."
Social Studies,"The other aspect of them-- and, as you could imagine, when we're talking about either Mussolini or the Nazis-- is that they weren't really fans of democracy. Not only did they think that everything should be subordinate to the state, but that the state should have absolute control. So it's not about democracy. It's about having a strong leader at the top. A strong one party at the top. And in the case of Mussolini it was the fascists. In the case of Hitler it ends up being the Nazis. So totalitarian."
Social Studies,"Completely totalitarian. And then, they also-- and these all gel together-- this idea of aggressive foreign policy. And this aggressive foreign policy is really rooted in this belief of cultural superiority. And, if you take the case of the Nazis, this belief in extreme racial superiority, cultural superiority. And I'm making a slight distinction there because in Mussolini's eyes, he was actually quite disparaging."
Social Studies,"Even though Hitler looked to Mussolini as something of a role model when Mussolini took power in 1922, it inspired Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch. Mussolini did not think much of Hitler through much of the 1920s and even early 1930s. He thought Hitler's ideas of racial purity were really an illusion. That there was no racially pure race. He didn't really appreciate Hitler calling the Italians a mongrel race. But Mussolini himself did think that the Italians were culturally superior."
Social Studies,"And that would be their justification for an aggressive foreign policy. For them taking over other territory in Europe and in Africa. And as we'll see, because they shared so much in common ideologically, the Nazis were, you could kind of view as a more extreme form. And the fascists themselves were quite extreme. But the Nazis were a more extreme form of the same ideology."
Social Studies,"They will, even though in the '20s and early '30s Mussolini is more eager to align himself with some of the other powers in Europe, in particular Great Britain and France. As we go into the second half of 1930s, Mussolini and Hitler find themselves to be kindred spirits. They both want to be aggressive in their foreign policy. They both want to secure other territory."
Social Studies,"They both have this idea that they need space for their superior populations, to their culturally superior, and in the case of the Nazis, racially superior populations to grow and thrive. And so as we enter into the second half of the 1930s and World War II, you have Mussolini and the fascists become close allies of Hitler and the Nazis.."
Social Studies,"He says, no this is Italy's chance for glory, this is Italy's chance to build its empire. So, in 1915 he's ousted from the Socialist Party and he decides to start his own group called the Fasci d'azione rivoluzionaria and I talk about that in the video on fascism, but it was often referred to as the Milan fascio (writing) the Milan fascio which was a group that was strongly nationalist that was pro entering the war."
Social Studies,"Italy does eventually enter the war, not necessarily because of these guys, this was still a fairly insignificant organization. The reason why I'm mentioning it is it shows Mussolini even before the war was showing these very strong nationalistic tendencies and this tendency to start organizations that were pro-nationalist and he tended to call them fasci. He get's this notion of fasci ..."
Social Studies,"The term had been used well before Mussolini for a kind of league of revolutionaries, league of people who are looking to take action on something. Then he enters into the war as a soldier and then exiting the war in 1919, he decides to reorganize or to start leading a group again. This time he calls it the Fasci di Combattimento. (writing) Fasci di Combattimento, battimento which could literally be translated as the league of combatants."
Social Studies,"This isn't even a formal party at this point of time, it's really a collection of a couple of hundred people. The estimates I've seen is about 200 individuals who group together. What unifies them is a strongly anti-socialist ideology. There's an irony here because Mussolini was in the socialist party before the war, but is a strongly anti-socialist ideology and a strongly nationalist ideology."
Social Studies,"To understand where this strong anti-socialist or anti-Bolshevik ideology came from you have to understand the context of Italy and Europe of that time. You have to remember that the Russian Empire fell during World War I, it was now run by the communists. You have a fear that that is going to spread throughout Europe. You have the leading party in Italy at the time is the Italian Socialist Party, you have a left-leaning government."
Social Studies,"There is a desire to react against that seeming spread of socialism or of communism. These guys don't view it as hey let's meet together and talk about and maybe try to run for elections. They want to actively coerce people. They want to actively intimidate people and these groups that would rise out of this, that would be strongly anti-socialist and the anti left-leaning government they would wear these black shirts and they were often called The Black Shirts."
Social Studies,"Which I wont write in black because then you wouldn't see it, so I'll write in this blue color. (writing) These Black Shirts. These were very loosely organized bands, they were often called fasci, it would often be young men who would gather together in towns throughout Italy and say we believe in this anti-socialist ideology, we want to take up arms and intimidate socialist, intimidate people on the left. So, you have these Black Shirts, this paramilitary group starting to arise."
Social Studies,"In 1919, I want to emphasize, very small, very, very small, very, very insignificant, but their influence grows. You have more and more of these fasci forming throughout Europe. Not through Europe, throughout Italy. This is very appealing to, especially young boys in Italy. Mussolini, himself, is a very inspiring orator. He's kind of this larger than life personality."
Social Studies,"Sometimes what he says didn't necessarily make complete logical sense, but it really appealed to people's emotions, that he was a strong leader, that someone that they would actually want to follow. In two short years you forward to 1921, (writing) 1921. This Fasci di Combattimento had now morphed into a real national party, it's now ... and they renamed themselves the nationalist or the National Fascist Party. (writing) Fascist Party. Obviously it wasn't called that in Italian."
Social Studies,"In Italian it was the Partito Nazionale Fascista and Mussolini is the leading figure here. He gets elected to the Chamber of Deputes. (writing) Chamber of Deputes along with several other fascists, but they're still a fairly small party. Although they've already now they're gaining steam, they're becoming mainstream, but even though they're becoming more mainstream they still haven't given up their use of force and their use of intimidation."
Social Studies,"Then we forward to 1922 and all of this is happening quite rapidly, but by 1922 Italy is not in a good situation. People aren't happy with the left-leaning government, they feel that it's weak, that it's not able to turn the economy around, that it's not able to bring order, that the extreme left is having too much power, that they're too many strikes, that the country isn't being run properly; the middle class and the elite aren't happy with this."
Social Studies,"So, the fascists are getting more and more and more followers. One, kind of you could say civilian followers, but they're also getting more and more fasci that are forming. They're showing that their use of violence actually can sometimes get goals that the weaker government couldn't get, they were able to break strikes in 1922 with the perception that that was helping to bring order."
Social Studies,"So, by October of 1922, (writing) by October of 1922, you have Mussolini at this head, he has this conference of 40,000 fascists and they essentially come to the idea that they need to march on Rome, to bring order to Italy, that they should demand, they should demand a stronger government. (writing) So, in October you have a march on Rome and I've seen several accounts of the size of this march on Rome, but the numbers that I've seen is on the order of 200,000. (writing) 200,000 fascists march on Rome."
Social Studies,"This essentially causes the current government to be ... the Prime Minister to be ousted and the King appoints Mussolini as Prime Minister. (writing)So, Mussolini, Mussolini is now the Prime Minister. So this is a super rapid ascend, really based on peoples' unhappiness with the left-leaning government, peoples' desire for a strong leader, Mussolini's kind of charisma. Every picture you see of him he has these really stern looks, he has this impression of a really strong figure."
Social Studies,"Not only did he become Prime Minister, but he's able to get dictatorial powers. The legislator actually gives him dictatorial powers for a year. (writing) Dictata-, dictatorial powers for one year, so you can't, at this point call him the dictator. We'll see that that's going to come in a few years, but he's granted, essentially, absolute control."
Social Studies,"He can pass laws at will and it's an interesting question of history of why at this point the legislator was willing to give him dictatorial powers and why the King was fine with this fairly strong character being Prime Minister with dictatorial powers. My understanding is, and I'm curious to see what you guys say in the message boards, is that it really was around ... people were desire ..."
Social Studies,"on one level there was a desire especially amongst the middle class and the elite, of having this strong leader, of maybe someone who could bring order and pride to the country. Then on top of that he was backed up by these, he was backed up by the Black Shirts, this paramilitary group that was dispersed throughout Italy that could intimidate his opponents."
Social Studies,"You could imagine some legislators were actually keen to support a strong leader after many years of weak leadership, but on top of that they probably felt intimidated into giving Mussolini these absolute powers.."
Social Studies,"By 1923 he makes the Blackshirts actually become a formal national militia, essentially the volunteer militia for national security. In Italian the acronym is the MVSN. So, the Blackshirts become formalized as the MVSN. He also gets Parliament or gets the legislature to pass what's known as the Acerbo Law or Acerbo Law. I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it. Acerbo Law."
Social Studies,"This is an interesting one because this is a law that allowed whichever majority party, whatever the largest party in the Deputy of Ministers, whatever the largest party in Parliament is that party, as long as they get more than 25% of the vote, they will get 2/3s of the seats in Parliament. This is strange because traditionally in a Parliamentary system if you got ... Let's say you were the largest party and you got 26% of the vote, you still would not have enough seats to govern properly."
Social Studies,"You would have to form a coalition with several other parties so that you could essentially form a government. But this is saying whoever gets the plurality of votes, whoever gets the most votes without necessarily being a majority, they will be by default become a majority. And you could imagine why the fascists wanted this to happen."
Social Studies,"They felt that they could get 25% of the votes, one maybe through popular support but also with the help of the coercive tactics of the Blackshirts and then that would give them stronger control in the legislature. Now, the big question is is why would the legislature pass this? Because at this point the fascists were not the dominant party. They did not have a majority in the legislature. In fact, this was why they wanted to pass a law because they didn't have a majority."
Social Studies,And once again it's one of those questions of history. Some would say that people were enamored with the fascists. They were enamored with Mussolini. They were eager to have strong leadership. They didn't want this government of coalitions. They wanted one government to be able to take action. On the other side when the votes were happening you actually had Blackshirts in the room. One argument is that there was also an element of pure intimidation. But needless to say the Acerbo Law actually passed.
Social Studies,"There is irony here because it was unnecessary. In 1924 when you actually have elections you have the fascists getting 2/3s of the vote. Fascists get 2/3 of the vote. Now, many today and many in Italy at the time felt that this was a fraudulent election. They felt the reason why the fascists were able to get so many votes is because they were able to intimidate folks. They were able to commit fraud during the election."
Social Studies,"They were able to kind of throw other votes out, and one of the most outspoken individuals when it came to criticizing the fascists and their tactics of coming to power was Giacomo Matteotti. He wrote a book about the fascists. He gave two really strong speeches in the Deputy of Ministers where he talks about or the Chamber of Deputies I should say, where he talks about the corruption and the violence of the fascists. A few days after giving those speeches he gets killed by Blackshirts."
Social Studies,"So, he gets actually quite violently murdered by Blackshirts, and this puts Mussolini at least initially in a bit of a bind. He doesn't want to look like a thug, someone who goes out and just murders people. It's not clear that he actually, Mussolini, was involved in this in any way, but his followers had committed this act. To protest against the murder of Giacomo Matteotti you actually have the entire socialist party boycotts Parliament."
Social Studies,"This was known as the Aventine Secession or at least the 20th century Aventine Secession. Aventine Secession. It's called the Aventine Secession because if you go back to Roman times 2500 years ago you had the Plebeians secede out of protest from harsh rule and they go to the Aventine Hill. So, it was named after that same idea. The whole reason why the socialists did this is they hoped that by boycotting Parliament that that would convince the King to get rid of Benito Mussolini."
Social Studies,"Mussolini, as I say, he's also in a bind. He doesn't know quite what to do, and on top of all of this the Blackshirts are telling him, ""Look, if you don't take control of the situation, if you don't become a strong ruler we're going to do it without you. We might even overthrow you Mr. Mussolini."" In 1925, early 1925, Mussolini makes his famous January speech. 1925, his famous January speech. This is normally viewed as the formal start of his absolute dictatorship."
Social Studies,"In this Mussolini, instead of the Aventine Secession somehow undermining Mussolini's power because the King did not dismiss Mussolini it actually strengthened Mussolini's power. He used that as a pretext. He said, ""Look, all of these deputies they've decided not to show up at Parliament. They've essentially given up their seats, and he bans, he bans the Italian Socialist party. He embraces the Blackshirts. He takes responsibility for them."
Social Studies,"He doesn't take responsibility directly for Giacomo Matteotti's murder, but he takes responsibility for the Blackshirts, and he gives in kind of classic Mussolini style a somewhat convoluted argument about how strength and violence is going to give stability to the Italian people. Obviously he is an amazing orator. He's very charismatic."
Social Studies,"This essentially gives him the control he needs, and by the end of 1925 you have the Christmas Eve Law that's passed by Parliament that esentially puts no checks on Mussolini's power, and as you go then into 1926 they more, and more, the fascists under Mussolini take absolute control, absolute power of Italy. So in 1926 they're banning other parties. So, other parties are banned."
Social Studies,"They're starting to force people to become members of the fascist party if they want roles in the government or even in any type of institution. They're starting to take control of the press. They're starting to have a very strong state police architecture. If this looks familiar based on what we studied about the Nazis it's not a coincidence. Hitler, he admired Mussolini. In fact, Mussolini's march on Rome inspired Hitler to attempt his Beer Hall Putsch in 1923."
Social Studies,A lot of these tactics that brought Mussolini to power you see kind of a parallel in what brought Hitler to power only about seven years later..
Social Studies,"And they would use the threat of force. They did use the state security apparatus to enforce their will. They took over the press. They banned all other parties. But there was also a popular sentiment that was supporting them. People wanted a strong-- or there were elements in Italy that were in favor of a strong leader, a charismatic leader, like Mussolini. But then as we get into the '30s, in particular the mid-1930s, Mussolini starts to become more aggressive in terms of foreign policy."
Social Studies,"And this eventually leads to him becoming less and less popular. And also leads him to getting more and more aligned with the Germans. You might remember, going into World War I, he actually wanted to fight in World War I on the side of the entente, which Italy eventually does do. And throughout this entire period, he does not want to rock the boat with Great Britain and France."
Social Studies,"But as his imperial ambitions grow, he'll find that he has more in common with Nazi Germany-- or he's finding more sympathy with Nazi Germany-- than he is with the British and French. And so we go to 1935, so we're obviously skipping a huge gap right over here. But as we get into 1935, Mussolini feels that it's time to really exercise his imperial ambitions. Italy already had holdings in northeast Africa. It had colonies in Eritrea, Italian Somaliland. And he had aspirations to take over Ethiopia."
Social Studies,"Ethiopia, at this point in time, was one of the few African nations that was not essentially colonized, or not being controlled, by a European power. It was at the time Ethiopia was called Abyssinia. And so in 1935, the Italians invade Abyssinia, invade Ethiopia. And not only is it a very aggressive invasion, it's also a very cruel invasion. They use chemical warfare. It's very ugly. Many, many, many civilians die."
Social Studies,"And this isn't taken well by the other powers of Europe, in particular Great Britain and France. But you might remember, based on what we learned about in Nazi Germany, that they were in no mood to start wars. They were kind of in an appeasement mode. And even with Italy they were willing to make a secret agreement, the Hoare-Laval. And this was a secret agreement that actually would have allowed Italy to maintain control over significant chunks of Ethiopia. But this was eventually leaked to the public."
Social Studies,"And the British and French public at this time did not tolerate this. And so this whole incident, the Italians invading Ethiopia, the unpopularity of this amongst the civilians in Great Britain and in France, this further distanced those countries from Italy. And the only major nation that was not opposed to Italy's invasion of Ethiopia was Germany. And so this started to bring Mussolini-- who in the 1920s did not think much of Hitler-- started to bring him closer and closer and closer to Hitler."
Social Studies,"And their invasion of Ethiopia would continue into the start and through World War II. And it's a famously cruel attempted colonization, or invasion. But these trends continue, his imperialistic tendencies, his alignment with more and more nationalistic nations in Europe. In 1936, you have the Spanish Civil War breaking out. And Mussolini decides to support the Nationalists led by Francisco Franco, who eventually comes to power. But Mussolini decides to support him."
Social Studies,"And this isn't a super popular thing amongst the Italians. They're like, what are we doing in these other countries trying to fight other people's war? But he decides to support the Nationalists. And once again, this brings him closer to the Germans and further away from Great Britain and the French who are not supportive of Francisco Franco. Then you forward to 1937, and as you remember Mussolini was vehemently anti-communist, vehemently anti-socialist. So were the Nazis. So were the Japanese."
Social Studies,"And so in 1937, Italy joins the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany and Japan. And this is essentially the nascent Axis powers. And this literally stands for anti-International Communism. So they're going to join together and aggressively fight communism wherever it might show, international communism. And this would eventually be the basis of the Axis powers as we go into World War II. And so then we get into 1939. And by 1939 Germany is already aggressively expanding its territory."
Social Studies,"It had already executed on the Anschluss. It had merged with Austria, or you could say it had unified with Austria. It had already taken over the Sudetenland. It was in process of taking over a significant part of Czechoslovakia. And Mussolini wanted in on the action as well. So in 1939, he decides to invade Albania. And this, right over here-- in case you don't know where Albania is-- this is a map of Europe at the time. And Albania is right over here. They're able to overrun Albania very quickly."
Social Studies,"The king deposed the king. And so Mussolini is exercising, once again, his imperial ambitions. He's getting closer and closer to the Nazis, who are frankly the main sympathizers with what Mussolini is trying to do. And so by May of that year-- the invasion of Albania is in April-- but by May of that year you have a final formal military alliance with the Nazis called the Pact of Steel."
Social Studies,"And as you might remember, this is only a few months-- so this is in May-- this is only a few months before the Nazi invasion of Poland, which is the catalyst for the beginning of World War II in Europe. Italy didn't immediately enter World War II in September of 1939 when the Nazis invade Poland. Similar to what Italy did in World War I, it was waiting to see which side seemed to be in a better position. By 1940, it felt that a Nazi victory was imminent."
Social Studies,And it decides to declare war on Britain and France. So declares war on Britain and France. And this is the formal entry of the Italians into World War II as part of the Axis powers..
Social Studies,"This is a big deal. China has been ruled by various dynasties for multiple thousands of years. But as you get into the 1900s, the dynastic rule, in particular the Qing Dynasty, was getting weaker and weaker. It had suffered at the hands of the Japanese during the first Sino-Japanese War at the end of the 1800s. There was growing discontent amongst the opposition that the dynasty, that the emperors, were not modernizing China enough. Remember, this is the early 1900s."
Social Studies,"The rest of the world was becoming a very, very modern place. China in the 1800s had suffered at the hands of Western powers who were essentially exerting their own imperial influence in China. Many people felt that this was because China was not as modernized economically, politically, technologically as it needed to be. And so you fast-forward to 1911. You have what is known as the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. By 1912, a Republic of China was established in Nanjing."
Social Studies,"So Nanjing right over here was where it was established. Beijing was, of course, the seat of dynastic rule in China. And the first provisional president of the Republic of China was Dr. Sun Yat-sen, right over here. And he actually did not directly participate in this final uprising that finally led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. He was actually in Denver at the time, Denver, Colorado."
Social Studies,"But he was a leading or one of the leading figures in the run up to this uprising, one of the leading figures who was providing opposition and had tried multiple times to overthrow the dynasty. Now along with Sun Yat-sen, he was essentially in cahoots with Yuan Shikai, who was a general in the old dynasty. And he has his own fascinating history. And Sun Yat-sen struck a deal with Yuan Shikai, who was very politically ambitious."
Social Studies,"Yuan Shikai said, hey, if I can get the emperor Puyi, who was the last emperor of China, if I can get him to officially abdicate, I want to become the president. So Sun Yat-sen agrees to this. So Yuan Shikai becomes the president of the Republic of China. But that wasn't enough for him. He declares himself emperor in 1915, which you could imagine did not make many people happy because they were tired of having emperors. And by 1916, he abdicates and he passes away, actually."
Social Studies,"And this actually begins a period of extremely fragmented rule for China. Even under imperial rule, the Chinese military was not one consolidated body. The military was controlled by various warlords in various regions that all had allegiance to the emperor. Once you have Yuan Shikai abdicating and then dying in 1916, and even prior to that, when he declared himself emperor, people did not want to pledge allegiance to Yuan Shikai. And so you had what is known as the beginning of the Warlord Era in China."
Social Studies,"And this is a fragmented period where you did not have any centralized leadership. This map over here shows kind of the rough picture of what the Warlord Era looked like. Each of these regions were controlled by a different warlord who was in charge of a different military. When this was going on during the Warlord Era, especially as we go back to the early '20s, in 1921 in particular, Sun Yat-sen hasn't given up."
Social Studies,"He goes to the south in Guangzhou and sets up, essentially, a revolutionary government, essentially a desire from there to try to consolidate power in China again and reestablish the Republic of China. So he goes there. But unfortunately he passes away in 1925 from cancer. And the hands or the power of the movement that he started, which is now being referred to as the Kuomintang-- Let me write that down. Essentially, the power there passes on to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek."
Social Studies,"And Chiang Kai-shek, the reason why we say the power essentially goes to him is because he was in control of the major part of the military forces of the Kuomintang. And this is essentially the very nascent early stages of what would essentially be the Chinese Civil War because in the period from 1921 until Sun Yat-sen's death, you actually had a lot of collaboration between the Chinese nationalists, the Kuomintang, and the Soviet Union, and the Chinese Communist Party."
Social Studies,"They were trying to collaborate in order to think about how China would unify. But then once Sun Yat-sen dies and the power of the Kuomintang essentially goes into the hands of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, he starts to consolidate power. And right from the get-go, he doesn't antagonize the communists. But by 1927, he's starting to consolidate, he's starting to merge these various factions in the rest of China. So he's able to consolidate power. But he also starts to go after the communists."
Social Studies,"So Chiang Kai-shek, by '27, also starts to go after the communists. And the communists are saying, hey, we are the ones that really represent the spirit of what Sun Yat-sen represented, while the Kuomintang under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek said, no, no, no. We represent what Sun Yat-sen represented when he first established the Republic of China."
Social Studies,"And so in 1927, you have the beginning of the Chinese Civil This is when the Kuomintang, as part of its efforts to consolidate power, not only tries to consolidate power of the warlords, but also goes after the Communist Party. Now while all of this is happening, as we get into the early 1930s, Japan once again is trying to exert its imperial, its military, might on the Chinese mainland."
Social Studies,"They had already captured Formosa, which is now known as Taiwan, and Korea during the first Sino-Japanese War at the end of the 1800s. And then in 1931, the Japanese start to encroach on Manchuria. And this would essentially become a multi-year occupation and infiltration of Japan into China. And this continues all the way until 1937, when it becomes an official all-out war between the Japanese and the Chinese. And I have a map here that shows kind of the maximum Japanese control over this period."
Social Studies,"And so in east Asia between the Chinese and the Japanese, World War II was really just part of the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese had already encroached on the mainland of China well before World War II had officially begun. Now while all this is happening, Japan is encroaching into Manchuria, in 1934, you have to remember, the Kuomintang, the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-shek is going after the communists. And in 1934, he almost has them, or he does. The communists are nearly defeated."
Social Studies,"They're surrounded by the Nationalist Party. And this becomes what is a fairly famous event in Chinese history, the famous Long March, where the Chinese Communist Party, their military, is marched through extremely tough terrain all the way to the northwest of China. So this right over here is a map of the Long March. The Chinese Communist Party seemed to be on the ropes here in 1934. And it was during this Long March that Mao Zedong really started to exert and show leadership."
Social Studies,"The leadership during this Long March, during this retreat to the northwest of China, is really what allowed Mao Zedong to eventually take control of the Chinese Communist Party. Now as we fast forward, we know that the Sino-Japanese War-- you could view this as one theater, eventually, of World War II-- eventually the US goes in on the side of the Allies against Japan after Pearl Harbor."
Social Studies,"And then in 1945, you have the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic weapons, which essentially ends the Pacific theater. It's defeat for Japan, and Japan has lost World War II. And at this point, full-scale civil war between the two parties break out again. The Civil War started in 1927, and then it kept continuing."
Social Studies,"But then once there was a common enemy in Japan that was clearly aggressively trying to take over more and more of China's people, resources, exert its imperial influence, then you had the two parties kind of go into a low-grade war and say, hey, we need to fight these Japanese. But once World War II ended in 1945, once the Japanese were defeated, then you had full-scale civil war break out again between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang."
Social Studies,"And this is probably one of the biggest comebacks in history. This was the Chinese Communist Party that in 1934 and 1935 looked like they were on the ropes. They were forced into, essentially, retreat. They were able to come back. And in 1949-- and there's a lot of theories as to why they were able to pull this off. That they were able to get much more of the support from the rural population. They were more savvy about getting support generally than the Kuomintang."
Social Studies,"But we could talk about that in a future video. But by 1949, they were able to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, force the Kuomintang to retreat to Taiwan, establish government in Taiwan. And ever since then, you had the establishment by the Chinese Communist Party in 1949 of the People's Republic of China.."
Social Studies,It is really just a think about how did things get started. Or what happened in the lead up? And to start I am actually going to focus on Asia and the Pacific. Which probably doesn't get enough attention when we look at it from a western point of view But if we go back even to the early 1900s. Japan is becoming more and more militaristic. More and more nationalistic. In the early 1900s it had already occupied... It had already occupied Korea as of 1910. and in 1931 it invades Manchuria.
Social Studies,"It invades Manchuria. So this right over here, this is in 1931. And it installs a puppet state, the puppet state of Manchukuo. And when we call something a puppet state, it means that there is a government there. And they kind of pretend to be in charge. But they're really controlled like a puppet by someone else. And in this case it is the Empire of Japan. And we do remember what is happening in China in the 1930s. China is embroiled in a civil war. So there is a civil war going on in China."
Social Studies,"And that civil war is between the Nationalists, the Kuomintang and the Communists versus the Communists The Communists led by Mao Zedong. The Kuomintang led by general Chiang Kai-shek. And so they're in the midst of the civil war. So you can imagine Imperial Japan is taking advantage of this to take more and more control  over parts of China And that continues through the 30s until we get to 1937. And in 1937 the Japanese use some pretext with, you know, kind of a false flag, kind of..."
Social Studies,"well, I won't go into the depths of what started it kind of this Marco-Polo Bridge Incident But it uses that as justifications to kind of have an all-out war with China so 1937...you have all-out war and this is often referred to as  the Second Sino-Japanese War ...Sino-Japanese War Many historians actually would even consider  this the beginning of World War II."
Social Studies,"While, some of them say, ok this is the beginning of the Asian Theater of World War II of the all-out war between Japan and China, but it isn't until Germany invades Poland  in 1939 that you truly have the formal beginning, so to speak, of World War II."
Social Studies,"Regardless of whether you consider this the formal beginning or not, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and it's called the second because there was another Sino-Japanese War in the late 1800s that was called the First Sino-Japanese War, this is incredibly, incredibly brutal and incredibly bloody a lot of civilians affected we could do a whole series of videos just on that But at this point it does become all-out war and this causes the civil war  to take a back seat to fighting off the aggressor  of Japan in 1937."
Social Studies,"So that lays a foundation for what's happening  in The Pacific, in the run-up to World War II. And now let's also remind ourselves  what's happening... what's happening in Europe. As we go through the 1930s Hitler's Germany, the Nazi Party, is getting more and more militaristic. So this is Nazi Germany... Nazi Germany right over here. They're allied with Benito Mussolini's Italy. They're both extremely nationalistic; they both do not like the Communists, at all You might remember, that in 1938..."
Social Studies,"1938, you have the Anschluss, which I'm sure I'm mispronouncing, and you also have the takeover  of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. So the Anschluss was the unification with Austria and then you have the Germans taking over the of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and this is kind of the famous, you know, the rest of the, what will be called the Allied Powers kind of say, ""Okay, yeah, okay maybe Hitler's  just going to just do that... well we don't want to start another war."
Social Studies,"We still all remember World War I; it was really horrible. And so they kind of appease Hitler and he's able to, kind of, satisfy his aggression. so in 1938 you have Austria, Austria and the Sudetenland ...and the Sudetenland..."
Social Studies,"are taken over,  are taken over by Germany and then as you go into 1939, as you go into 1939 in March they're able to take over all of Czechoslovakia they're able to take over all of Czechoslovakia and once again the Allies are kind of, they're feeling very uncomfortable, they kind of, have seen something like this before they would like to push back, but they still are, kind of, are not feeling good  about starting another World War so they're hoping that maybe Germany stops there."
Social Studies,"So let me write this down... So all of Czechoslovakia... ...Czechoslovakia... is taken over by the Germans. This is in March of 1939. And then in August you have the Germans, and this is really in preparation for, what you could guess is about to happen, for the all-out war that's about to happen the Germans don't want to fight  the Soviets right out the gate, as we will see, and as you might know, they do eventually take on the Soviet Union, but in 1939 they get into a pact with  the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"And so this is, they sign the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union, this is in August, which is essentially  mutual non-aggression ""Hey, you know, you do what you need to do, we know what we need to do."" and they secretly started saying ""Okay were gonna, all the countries out here, we're going to create these  spheres of influence where Germany can take, uh, control of part of it and the Soviet Union, and Stalin is in charge  of the Soviet Union at this point, can take over other parts of it."
Social Studies,"And then that leads us to the formal start where in September, let me write this in a different color... so September of 1939, on September 1st, Germany invades Poland Germany invades Poland on September 1st, which is generally considered  the beginning of World War II. and then you have the Great Britain and France declares war on Germany so let me write this World War II..."
Social Studies,"starts everyone is declaring war on each other, Germany invades Poland, Great Britain and France  declare war on Germany, and you have to remember at this point Stalin isn't so concerned about Hitler he's just signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and so in mid-September, Stalin himself invades Poland as well so they both can kind of carve out... ...their spheres of influence..."
Social Studies,"so you can definitely sense that things are  not looking good for the world at this point you already have Asia in the  Second Sino-Japanese War, incredibly bloody war, and now you have kind of, a lot of very similar actors  that you had in World War I and then they're starting to get into  a fairly extensive engagement.."
Social Studies,"And so now we are going to enter into 1940. And were going to see that in 1940 and 1941 things only start to accelerate in the Nazis', and, as we'll soon call them, the Axis Powers' favor. So in April, you have the Germans  invade Denmark and Norway ...Denmark and Norway... ...let me make sure that I spell that right... So Germany invades Denmark and Norway. This is April of 1940. and then you have May of 1940 Germany invades the Netherlands and Belgum. So Netherlands...."
Social Studies," let me just write...let me write... The Low Countries it's sometimes called because this place, the land in the Netherlands, right over here, is very close to sea level or sometimes even below sea level. Low Countries So invades Netherlands, invades Belgium. Kind of, kind of very similar  to what happened in World War I, where that's kind of how Germany gets to France. And then in June, in June, Italy enters the fray. Italy, which we've seen before, Italy declares war."
Social Studies,"Italy in the war, Benito Mousselini in the run-up to World War II is getting closer and closer to Adolf Hitler. And so, in June, Italy declares war on the Allies, on Great Britain and France. And so now Italy, so now Italy is formally in World War II. And as soon as Italy joins World War II, you start having all these skirmishes out here between Italy's colonies, and it's kind of where they're ruling colonially, in Libya, and in Egypt where the  British are essentially in control."
Social Studies,"So you start having all of these skirmishes across the border, the Egyptian and Libyan border. So that was, that was June,  and actually June, Italy is into the war. And then shortly thereafter France falls to Germany. So this wasn't like World War I where we get kind of embroiled in all this trench warfare, that lasts over the duration of most of the war; very quickly, think about it, this is only what... eight, nine months into the war. France falls, a major power, France falls to Germany."
Social Studies,"And they install Vichy France, which at  first is in control for the part of France roughly the part of France that I'm highlighting. This the town of Vichy, which was the capitol of Vichy France. Which is why it's called that. And then later the rest of what's called Free France  falls to Germany, later in the war in 1942. But things are really, really not looking good for the Allies."
Social Studies,"So France falls, falls to Germany, the establishment of Vichy France, which is  essentially controlled by the Germans, and then in July, Germany begins bombing Britain. So bombing... bombing Britain. The famous Battle of Britain, which was actually called  The Battle of Britain even before it began. Winston Churchill said, hey, we have to prepare for the upcoming Battle of Britain. And Germany starts bombing Great Britain. And then thing get only worse from there."
Social Studies,"So in September, in September the Axis forms with Japan, Japan joining. Japan signs the Tripartite Pact, and so becomes... ...the Axis forms between Japan Italy and Germany. ...signs Tripartite Pact.... So Japan is in the mix, and since France is already fallen to Germany."
Social Studies,"So Japan is now formally part of the Axis with Italy and Germany And since France has fallen to Germany, Japan says, hey, maybe we can go after some of France's colonies, and in particular French-Indochina, which we now refer to as Vietnam and Cambodia. And so, shortly thereafter, Japan attacks French Indo-China. so things are not really looking good at all. and it only gets worse from there. In November..."
Social Studies,"so once again we're  a little over a year into the war now, we're entering the end of 1940, in November, Hungary and Romania are pressured to join the Axis So Hungary and Romania join the Axis So as we see as we kind of are leaving 1940, things  are not looking good at all for the Allied powers. You see this map, and I apologize for my messiness, it's looking more and more and more red."
Social Studies,"The only slightly, kind of, saving grace for the Allied Powers is what's happening over here in North Africa, is that eventually the end of 1940, the British are able to drive the Italians back into Libya. So let me do this in a different color,  I'll do blue for the Allies So the British are able to drive  the Italian forces back into Libya."
Social Studies,"And they are essentially able to defeat the Italians in Libya, and, but that's only going to take us into 1941,  which I'll talk about in the next video, where the Germans send reinforcements under the command of Rommel, and they're able to drive the  British back again into Egypt, and we'll see in 1941 Germany  and the Axis Powers only become more and more  and more aggressive. And as we enter the end of 1941 we'll see  the entry of the US into World War II.."
Social Studies,"So let's think about what happens in 1941. So, if we talk about early 1941 or the Spring of 1941, in March, Bulgaria decides to join the Axis powers. You can imagine there's a lot of pressuring applied to them and they kind of see where the momentum is. Let's be on that side."
Social Studies,"Bulgaria joins the Axis and then in North Africa you might remember that in 1940, the Allies, in particular, the British, were able to defeat the Italians and push them back into Libya but now in March of 1941, the Italians get reinforcements, Italian reinforcements and also German reinforcements under the command of Rommel the Desert Fox, famous desert commander and they are able to push the British back to the Egyptian border and they also take siege of the town of Tobruk."
Social Studies,"Now, you might have noticed something that I just drew. The supply lines in the North Africa campaign are very, very, very long and that's part of the reason why there's one side. One side has supply lines and as they start to make progress and as the Allies make progress and push into Libya, their supply lines got really long and so the other side has an easier timely supply."
Social Studies,"Then as the Axis pushes the Allies back into Egypt, then their supply lines get really long and the other side...it makes it easier for them to resupply and so North Africa is kind of defined by this constant back and forth. But, by early 1941, it looks like the Axis is on the offensive, able to push the British back into Egypt lay siege to the town of Tobruk. So, let me write this down as North Africa."
Social Studies,"So, I'll just say North Africa over here or I'll could say Rommel in North Africa pushing the British back. And then we can start talking about what happens in the Balkans and this is still in Spring as we go into April of 1941 and just as a little bit of background here, and frankly I should have covered it a couple of videos ago. As far back as 1939, actually before World War II officially started, in Spring of 1939, Italy actually occupies Albania so this actually should have already been red."
Social Studies,"This is in 1939 that this happens and then at the end of 1940, Italy uses Albania as a base of operation to try to invade Greece but they are pushed back. Actually one of the reasons why the British we able to be pushed back in North Africa is after they were successful against the Italians, most of the bulk of the British forces we sent to Greece to help defend Greece at the end of 1940."
Social Studies,"So, in 1939, Albania gets taken over by Italy and at the end of 1940...October 1940, Greece is invaded by Italy but they are then pushed back but to help the Greeks, the Allies send many of the forces that were in North Africa after they were successful against the Italians in Libya. Now, as we go into April of 1941... that was all background, remember Albania before the war started in April 1939, October 1940 was Italy's kind of first push into Greece and it was unsuccessful."
Social Studies,"Then the Greeks get support from the Allies in North Africa and now as we go into 1941, the Germans start supporting and really take charge in Balkans and in Greece and so with the help of the Germans the Axis is able to take over Yugoslavia and Greece and start aerial bombardment of Crete. So, once again, we're not even halfway through the year in 1941 and we see a huge swath of Europe is under the control of the Axis powers. And now we go into the summer of 1941."
Social Studies,"This is actually a pivotal move, what's about to happen. Now you can imagine that the Axis powers, in particular, Hitler, are feeling pretty confident. We are only about that far into the war. So we're not even two years into the war yet and it looks like the Axis is going to win. Now you might remember that they have a pact with the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"Hey, we're gonna split a lot of Eastern Europe into our spheres of influence so to speak, but now Hitler's like, well, I think I'm ready to attack and when you attack the Soviet Union really matters. You do not want to attack the Soviet Union in the winter...or Russia in the winter. Russia's obviously at the heart of the Soviet Union. That something that Napoleon learned. Many military commanders have learnt."
Social Studies,"You do not want to be fighting in Russia over the winter, so summer of 1941, Hitler figures, hey, this is the Axis chance. And so, in June, he decides to attack the Soviet Union. So, this is a very, very, very bold move because now they're fighting the British. Remember, the British are kind of not a joke to be battling out here in Western Europe and now they're going to be taking on the Soviet Union in the east, a major, major world power."
Social Studies,"But at first, like always, it seems like it's going well for the Germans. By September, they're able to push up all the way to Leningrad. So, this is September of 1941 and lay lay siege and begin laying siege to that town. This is kind of a long bloody siege that happens there. So, we're right now, right about there. And most historians would tell you that this was one of the mistakes of Adolph Hitler because now he is stretched very, very, very thin."
Social Studies,"He has to fight two world powers, Soviet Union and Great Britain and the United States hasn't entered into the war yet and that's what we're about to get into because if we go into Asia it was still in 1941 what happens in July. So, little bit after Hitler decides to start invading the Soviet Union going back on the pact, the non- aggression pact."
Social Studies,"In July, you could imagine the US, they were never pleased with what's been happening, what the Empire of Japan has been doing in the Pacific, what they've been doing in China, in Manchuria or even in terms of the war in China, the second Sino Japanese War. They weren't happy of the Japanese taking over French Indochina. There's a big world power here, the Empire of Japan."
Social Studies,"There's a big world power here, the United States, that has a lot of possessions in the Pacific and so, the United States in July of 1941...So remember, this is still all 1941, this is the same year...decides to freeze the assets of Japan and probably the most important part of that was an oil embargo of Japan. This is a big, big deal. Japan is fighting a major conflict with the Chinese."
Social Studies,"It's kind of flexing it's imperial muscles but it does not have many natural resources in and of itself and in fact, that's one of the reasons why it's trying to colonize other places to get more control of natural resources. And now if it's fighting a war it doesn't have it's own oil resources and now there's an oil embargo of Japan and the United States at the time was major oil producer and even today, it's major oil producer."
Social Studies,"This was a big deal to the Japanese because some estimates say they only had about two years of reserves and they were fighting a war where they might have to touch their reserves even more. So, you could imagine the Japanese, they want to have their imperial ambitions."
Social Studies,"They probably want, especially now with this oil embargo, they probably want to take over more natural resources and they probably want to knock out the US or at least keep the US on its heels so the US can't stop Japan from doing what it wants to do. So, all it wants in December 1941, that's over the course of December 7th and 8th, and it gets a little confusing because a lot of this happens across the International Date Line."
Social Studies,"But over the course of December 7th and 8th, Japan goes on the offensive in a major way in the Pacific. Over the course of several hours, at most, a day, Japan is able to attack Malaya, which is a British possession. It's able to attack Pearl Harbor, where the US Pacific fleet is in hope to knock out the US Pacific fleet so the US will have trouble stopping Japan from doing whatever Japan wants to do."
Social Studies,"In the US, we focus a lot on Pearl Harbor but this was just one of the attacks in this whole kind of several hours of attacks where Japan went on the offensive. So, we have Malaya, we have Pearl Harbor, we have Singapore, we have Guam, we have (which was the US military base), Wake Island. You have the Philippines, which was a US possession ever since the Spanish American war."
Social Studies,"You have Hong Kong, which is a British possession and then shortly after that as you get further into December, so this is kind of when you have Japan offensive. Then as you go on into later Decemeber, the kind of real prize for Japan was what we would now call Indonesia but the Dutch East Indies. On this map it says Netherlands East Indies. You have to remember the Netherlands had been overrun."
Social Studies,"They're the low countries they were already overrun by German forces so the Japanese say hey, look there are a lot of resources here, natural resources, especially oil. Let's go for this and so by the end of 1941, they're also going for the Dutch East Indies and for Burma so you could imagine it's a very aggressive, very, very bold move on Japan but they kind of had imperial ambitions."
Social Studies,"They were afraid of they access to natural resources so they went for it but obviously one of the major consequence of this is the United States was not happy about this and they were already sympathetic to the Allies. They didn't like what was going on in Europe either. They didn't like what was going on in China and so that causes the United States to enter into World War II on the side of the Allies and then the Axis powers to declare war on the United States, which was a big deal.."
Social Studies,"And even before that you´ve had conflicts since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. So Asia has been in conflict for some time. But as we go into 1942, the United States has just entered into World War II. You might remember - December 1941, Japan goes on a major offensive, tries to knock out the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, attacks Wake Island, attacks Guam, attacks Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaya."
Social Studies,"Then shortly thereafter goes after other possessions, Burma, goes after the Dutch-East Indies in its quest for natural resources. And so you can imagine as we go into 1942, the Americans are eager to retaliate. And in these videos - these are overview videos, I cannot talk about every action and battle that happens. I`m just trying  to give you the hightlights - But the first notable action in 1942 is the Doolittle Raid. Named after Colonel Doolittle, who is the architect of this raid."
Social Studies,"The idea is not so much as a strategic victory but more of a psychological one. If the U.S. could somehow attack the mainland of Japan, bomb the mainland of Japan, it would be a huge morale booster for the Americans, and it might cause the Japanese people to question their own leadership."
Social Studies,"And so the idea is  sent a carrier within bomber range roughly 1000 miles of the coast of Japan - and I tried to do research on where they went but I wasn`t able to find - but roughly 1000 miles of the coast of Japan and then send 16 B-25 bombers to bomb the mainland. And they are actually able to do this. 15 of the bombers, since they can`t land back onto the carrier, they are to heavy and to large to do that, they land in China and one of them gets diverted to Russia or the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"And out of the 80 crewman all of planes get lost but out of the 80 crewman three are killed in action, eight are captured, and three are killed in captivity  by the Japanese. But for the most part a hugely successful operation. Only months after Pearl Harbor, the U.S. is able to attack the Japanese mainland. Once again, more of a psychological victory then a strategic one, but a major psychological accomplishment from the ally point of view."
Social Studies,"This was in April, then you can fast forward to May, where you have  the first major naval engagement between the Japanese and the American navy. And that happens  at the Battle of Coral Sea, or the Battle of the Coral Sea, which occurs  roughly over there. And this is significant because the U.S. loses more than the Japanese do, but it is able to cripple the Japanese navy enough that as they go  into the next major offensive, they don´t have quite the firepower that they need."
Social Studies,And that next major offensive happens in June at Midway. In June you have the Battle of Midway. At the Battle of Midway this is a Japanese offensive. Their goal is to further knock out the United States. But it ends up going the other way. And this is considered a big deal. This is the first Japanese naval loss since the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits in 1863. You have a U.S. victory here. Many historians consider this one of the most significant naval battles. We have a U.S. victory here.
Social Studies,"Once again, it´s only seven months since Pearl Harbor. You have Coral Sea which cripples the Japanese navy. - maybe cripple is a strong word but tears them down a little bit - Then you have Midway which is a major U.S. victory. And then that takes us to August where you have the Battle of Guadalcanal. There are several islands over here, the U.S. want to take it, the Japanese want to retake it. But between the on-the-ground forces and the naval forces, the U.S."
Social Studies,"is able to defeat the Japanese and keep them from taking Guadalcanal. This is a big deal because between Midway and Guadalcanal in 1942, this is the turning point. And after this point, Midway,  the Japanese were on the offensive here, the Japanese tried to get the U.S. out of Guadalcanal in August. But in both of those the U.S. are able to defeat the Japanese at Midway, they are able to fend them off at Guadalcanal. This is the turning point where the U.S. is able to go on the offensive."
Social Studies,"1942 is a very big deal. It´s only months after Pearl Harbor, months after the U.S. enters the war but it´s able to start turning the tide, and start to go on the offensive against the Japanese in the Pacific. And what we´ll see in the next video is 1942 also marks the turning of the tide in Europe.."
Social Studies,"Then you have the Battle of Coral Sea and then Midway. Midway in particular was a huge -- I shouldn´t put red there, I should leave it blue -- was a huge success for the American Navy, followed by Guadalcanal after which the U.S. is able to go on the offensive against the Japanese. We see a significant turning of the tide in 1942 in the Pacific. And it also turns out  to be the case in Europe that we see a turning of the tide in 1942."
Social Studies,"Just as Guadalcanal is occuring, you might remember that in 1941 Hitler and the Nazis decided they want to attack the Soviet Union, probably not a good idea, they going to stretch themselves thin, but they do so anyway. The Siege of Leningrad  starts in 1941, and then in 1942 by August, they are able to reach Stalingrad, which is right about here. And Stalingrad, it´s now called Volgograd, is right about there if the map extended over there. This is a major series of battles in World War II."
Social Studies,"Movies are made about Stalingrad, incredibly bloody. Incredibly -- if you look at the pictures of the city of Stalingrad  after the battles there, the city is essentially in ruins. But the battles in Stalingrad start in August of 1942 and they continue for several months, going up to February of 1943. But this marks the turning point for Hitler. He´s getting bogged down in Leningrad, he´s getting bogged down in Stalingrad, eventually gets defeated in Stalingrad in early 1943."
Social Studies,"And his armies  are really spread thin. Stalingrad is a hugely important event or series of events in World War II. And let´s just be clear where we are right now. Stalingrad commences in August of 1942. And just to frame it in your mind - relativ to the Pacific Theater, this is right around - plus or minus a few weeks - of when Guadalcanal was going on, conflict between the Japanese and the American navies. You have these incredibly  bloody series of battles at Stalingrad."
Social Studies,"Then in October, we´ve been talking about this back and forth, in North Africa and some people are: ""Why are they even worried about North Africa?"" And I should have mentioned this earlier, but we have to remember that there is somewhat strategic here called the Suez Canal. Why is the Suez Canal strategic? It connects the Mediterranean with the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. You don`t have to go  all the way around Africa to go from Europe to the Indian Ocean."
Social Studies,"It`s an incredibly strategic passage or way to travel by sea between -- I guess for the world --  but especially between Europe and Asia. You can imagine, the British were very keen on protecting the Suez Canal and the axies would have loved to get control of the Suez Canal. Let me write this here. This right over here is the Suez Canal. And as we go into October, this is Stalingrad commences right over here."
Social Studies,"And as we go into October, the British are able to defeat or start to deafeat the axies and then push them back. This eventually leads to the British being able to go all the way to Tunisia. This is the final back- and-forth-blow that starts to secure victory for the allies in North Africa. And at the same time that this is commencing in October, you have other allied forces, starting to arrive in Morroco and Algeria. Forces from the U.S."
Social Studies,"are arriving in Morroco, and forces from the U.K., from Great Britain, are arriving in Algeria. This is going to give the allies control of North Africa, from which they can now mount assaults onto the European mainland, which we will see in the next series of videos. Definitely the tide is turning, and the allies are starting to be able to go on the offensive both in the Pacific and the European Theater.."
Social Studies,"or its not the turning point '42 really is the turning point but in 1943, the momentum's really in the allies favor the Soviets defeat the Germans at Stalingrad they are able to push the Germans and the axis powers out of the caucases and then they'd begin to advance and then the Soviets begin to advance and retake ground from the axis powers now at the same time you might remember that at the end of 1942 in North Africa in North Africa, let me go right over here I have all these maps layered over here you might remember that the British were able to push back the axis army back into Lybia and then this just continues as we go into 1943 and the allied armies essentially able to kick the axis army out of North Africa be victorious of North Africa you remember you have these the armies that are coming from Egypt you also had allies land in Morocco and Algeria and then they all meet up and by mid-year they're able to use their victory in North Africa as a launching point to start attacking the main land of Italy they first, they can go to Sicily or then they go to the actual main land, and there's an attack at Selerno and they start to really kind of fight their way up the Italian peninsula we're gonna do this in a blue color so you can see this is the allies, as were going to mid- and late- 1943 are able to take more and more of the Italian peninula now as this happens, conditions i Italy aren't good the Italian people aren't happy and they're actually able to depose Mussolini so let me write that down so this is, In 1943 Mussolini, oh i think there's another s, Mussolini is deposed Mussolini is, Mussolini is deposed and as we get later that year, Italy formally surrenders to the allies now with that said, Italy has surrendered but the entire country of Italy the entire peninsula, there's still axis troops there so the allies have to continue  to slog through 1943 and 1944 and even to 1945 to completely rid Italy of the axis powers, and especially the Germans now Rome especially is fairly hard bombing campaigns start in Rome in order to completely get the axis powers out of there and that all is completely happening in 19- this is all happening in 1943 now other, other things of note and there's many things that are happening in Europe and once again these are just over view videos that are happening in 1943 is American forces early in 1943 are able to start doing bombing attacks on Germany itself and these bombing attacks only become more and more fierce as the war progresses another battle of note, In mid-1943 is the battle of kursk and this is really the last offensive that the axis powers are able to mount on the Eastern Front and they are defeated in this battle by the soviets and then once again that allows the Soviets to start going on the offensive so when you look at things from a European point of view the allies are definitely, they have the bulk over the momentum now they're now kind of putting the squeeze on the axis powers and frankly the same thing is happening in the Pacific especially the Americans, they are now on the offensive they're able to get closer and closer and closer to Japan."
Social Studies,"I guess you could say in Japanese territory. And with the taking on Kwajalein, just as a bit of a reminder, the Americans, amongst other things, now had control of the Soloman Islands. They now have control of the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. They now have control of the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. And as we'll see, the real theme of 1944 as we get into the middle of and the end of the year is to get as close as possible to the Japanese mainland."
Social Studies,"Because the Americans now had a B-29, or they had the B-29 bomber that had a 1500 mile radius. 1500 mile, I guess I could say 1500 mile range."
Social Studies,"Which means if they're able to get points of where their bombers could land and take off, and once again these bombsers are way too large and heavy to land on a carrier, but if they can find islands where they can do that from within a 1500 mile range of Japan then the United States could have bombing attacks directly on Japan and hopefully get closer to an end to the war. So that was really the theme, get as close as possible to Japan and then there was a secondary theme of take back The Philippines."
Social Studies,"One, it was a matter of pride, it was a former US possession ever since the Spanish-American War. But then on top of that, The Philippines are incredibly strategic for shipping lanes from Indonesia, remember those raw materials, those resources, that oil that Japan wanted from Indonesia. If you control The Philippines you're gonna control the shipping lanes between Indonesia and Japan. So you could deprive Japan of those natural resources."
Social Studies,"So The United States' kind of main focal areas in 1944, get as close as possible to Japan, get within bombing range, and take The Philippines. And this is exactly what they did. As we go into the summer of 1944, and one, there were some, as early as the summer of 1944, some bombing raids that took off in China to Japan with the new B-29s. So you do have some of these that happened as early, some of these bombing raids happened as early as summer of 1944."
Social Studies,"But in terms of actual islands, or territory The United States takes or takes back in the summer, in June of 1944, you have The Battle of the Philippine Sea. So Battle of Philippine Sea occurs right around, right around here. It's a victory for The US. It's a victory for The US. And it ends up really, really hurting Japanese ability to field carriers, have air warfare from carriers because so much of their carrier capability was damaged in The Battle of Philippine Sea."
Social Studies,"So, The Battle of Philippine Battle of the Philippine Sea this occurs in June And along with that, in the summer, the Allies are able to take several islands in The Mariana Islands. Once again, this is gonna be super important because from The Marianas, they're able to launch B-29 bombing attacks on the mainland in Japan."
Social Studies,"And so over that summer the Allies, the Americans in particular, are able to take Saipan, they are able to take Guam, they are able to take Tinian, which is this little island right over here. Some of these islands are quite hard to find. They're super small, in fact, even these little dots exaggerate their size, if you were to actually go onto Google Maps or Google Earth you'll see how small these are. And I encourage you to look at them it's really fascinating to see how small some of these islands are."
Social Studies,"They're really atolls, a lot of these are more atolls then islands. Not all of them are atolls. But you see, they barely have enough space for a landing strip for planes, especially the B-29s. And then as we go further into the summer and we start entering kind of later in the year, the Americans are able to take, at the time what was called Peleliu, now it's Palu."
Social Studies,"So Peleliu, they're able to take Morotai, and then perhaps most importantly in 1944, this might be the biggest deal out of all of these pacific battles that occur and all of these naval battles that occur, is The Battle of Leyte an The Battle of Leyte Gulf."
Social Studies,"Because The Battle of Leyte was important because in the process of taking Leyte The United States essentially is able to knock out the Japanese's ability to further defend, I mean they will continue, but realistically defend the rest of The Philippines. So once Leyte is taken by the Allies the odds of the Japanese being able to hold the rest of The Philippines becomes very low."
Social Studies,"And maybe even more important, The Battle of Leyte Gulf, which occurs right around there, it's an incredibly decisive battle for the American Navy. The Japanese go all in, and that bet is not a good one. The Japanese Navy is pretty much destroyed in The Battle of Leyte Gulf. And so 1944, once again, very good year for the Allies. Very bad year for the Japanese. Now the Allies are in control of they're in control of air strips, from which they can take B-29 raids to the mainland of Japan."
Social Studies,"So air strips, they can now, they're now within range to do bombing attacks on the mainland of Japan, and they now are very likely to control The Philippines and control the shipping lanes from Indonesia to Japan and they've all but destroyed the Japanese Navy. So, once again, things are not looking very good for Japan. And as we go into 1945, we'll see the Allies get closer and closer and get more intense bombing raids on Japan."
Social Studies,"And every time they get closer, the battles to take these islands, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, incredibly incredibly bloody and The United States says, 'Well what do we have to do to get the Japanese to surrender?' And we'll see what, at least in the mind of Truman, needs to happen.."
Social Studies,"Incredibly bloody siege, incredibly hard on the civilians of Leningrad. But the Soviet army is finally able to end that, and so you see from these troop movements on this map starting in January of 1944 with the end of the siege, they are able to really take the offensive and start marching through the Baltics, through the Baltic states. At the same time, you have the Soviet armies marching and they're able to force the Axis to surrender in the Crimea."
Social Studies,"You fast forward further into the year, further into 1944. You might remember in 1943, the Allies were able to land on Italy and force the surrender of Italy to the Allied powers. But that doesn't mean that Italy, as we know it today, or even as we knew it then, was free of the German troops, or from the Axis troops. And so, the Allies were continuing to slog through, slog through Italy, and in particular Rome. Rome did not get liberated in 1943. The Allies had to continue bombing Rome."
Social Studies,"And it doesn't get liberated until June of 1944. So Rome is liberated. So liberated in the summer of 1944. That happens June, 5th. The next day, and this is probably one of the most famous events in World War II, especially from an American point of view, something that's documented in many films, is June, 6th, D-Day, 1944. You have the invasion of Normandy, the amphibious invasion of Normandy, probably most famously depicted in the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan."
Social Studies,"We have British, primarily British and American troops. They are able to storm the beaches of Normandy successfully which allows them to start making progress in northern France towards Germany. Now, also in the summer of 1944, rockets start to get involved in a serious way in World War II. The Germans are starting to send their V1 rockets over to Great Britain. And the V1 rockets, this is just significant from the history of technology."
Social Studies,"Obviously today rockets play a big deal in a whole bunch of context, and this was the first time that they were deployed in a major way during a war. The first V1 rockets, they weren't all that impressive, they traveled three or four hundred miles per hour, slower than modern jet-liners. They didn't travel at that high of an altitude."
Social Studies,"But as we'll see, or as we'll see even in this video, within a few months, by September, they were sending in V2 rockets, which were far more advanced, going several thousand miles per hour, getting to altitudes of tens of miles high, and carrying even larger payloads. So the Germans were really starting to push the envelope in terms of rocket science. What's good about the Allie is, is that the Germans were kind, they developed this technology a little bit late."
Social Studies,"They are starting to be on the heels, obviously, on both the Western front and the Eastern front, and even in the South the Allies were really on the offensive now, but rockets are starting to get involved. V1's in the summer, and then the V2's in the fall. Now, also as we go into the late summer and fall, you see that Russians, after defeating the Germans at Kursk, are marching towards, are marching towards Poland, and marching in particular towards Warsaw, as we go through 1944."
Social Studies,"And at the end of 1944, not the end really, at the end of the summer of 1944, in August of 1944, you have the Polish uprising, you have kind of the rebels. The underground is taking on the German occupiers. So this is August, 1944. August, 1944. With the Russian troops, or the Soviet troops not that far away, they're getting closer and closer and closer to Warsaw. Now, also in August of 1944, you have Paris, is liberated. So this is August, 25th, 1944. Paris is liberated."
Social Studies,"And then, as we go later into that year, British troops are able to liberate Athens. So British troops are able to liberate Athens. So Athens is liberated. And actually this, once this liberated, then you start having the beginnings of the Civil War, of the Greek Civil War that occurs between kind of the government troops and the Communists, or as you say the more left-leaning people who were involved in fighting against the Axis powers."
Social Studies,"So, even though they were liberated, it's kind of the start of another unfortunate chapter with the Greek Civil War. And then, finishing out 1944, the Axis powers, and particularly the Germans, they weren't done yet. Even though the war is not looking good, they finally mount a, I guess you could say one of their last counteroffensive, just not their last major counteroffensive. And that's over here against the Allied troops, particularly the American troops, at the Battle of the Bulge."
Social Studies,"And this starts in December of 1944. It's called the Battle of the Bulge because the shape in which, so if the Allied, you know, the front, the Allied front looks like that as it is advancing. The Germans mount a counteroffensive and they are able to create a, what's called in military terms a salient, where they're able to push through, where they're able to push through and kind of create, and create this bulge."
Social Studies,"This is an incredibly bloody battle, it's actually the most bloody battle faced by American troops. They lose nearly 20 thousand, not just lose, 20 thousand die, American troops die just in the Battle of the Bulge that starts in December of 1944. But this really is the Germans last hurrah. You can see they're riding on the wall, troops approaching from the West, troops approaching from the East, troops approaching from the South.."
Social Studies,"on the Allied side, lose roughly 20,000 troops, but by January, they're able to break through and invade Germany. So as you go into early 1945, the Allies are on their march through Western Germany. Now if you go on the east, the Russians or the Soviets are also marching westward. By January of 1945, they're able to take Warsaw, and from there, they continue to march westward towards Berlin. Now the writing is on the wall at this point."
Social Studies,"The Allies look like they are going to win, and so they meet at Yalta, the major powers, to discuss what happens to Europe after World War II. What happens to Germany? Is it split up? What influence will the different Allied victors have in the different countries of World War II? So this is happening in Yalta in February of 1945. Let me write that down. That's in February."
Social Studies,"All the while this is happening, even though the writing is on the wall that the Allies are going to win the war, they weren't taking anything for granted. They wanted to absolutely force a surrender by the Axis powers in Germany in particular. So they continue to firebomb major cities of Germany, and firebombing is an incredibly devastating form of bombing, where you're literally trying to destroy the city, set the city on fire."
Social Studies,"The most notable of these cities that were firebombed were Hamburg and Dresden. The firebombing of Dresden, movies and books are written about it. The Nazis did also firebomb London, but that didn't have quite the same devastating effect as the Allied firebombing of Hamburg and Dresden, and actually of Tokyo and other Japanese cities, as we will see in a few minutes. But then everything really comes to a head in April of 1945."
Social Studies,"It's in April that as you can see, as you get into April and May, the Allies are able to essentially occupy major chunks of Germany. They're able to push Axis forces outside of Italy. They have effectively won. Mussolini gets captured and then gets executed. Soviets are able to take Berlin, and maybe most importantly, April 30th, Hitler commits suicide. So, Hitler commits suicide, and he's not the only one. Several other major leaders, Nazi leaders, commit suicide as we go into this period right over here."
Social Studies,"Essentially the war is won in Europe at this point, and that's made official on May 8th, May 8th, which is a good day to remember, known as VE Day, Victory in Europe, Victory in Europe Day. So the Allies have won in Europe, but everything is not over yet. World War II is still going on in the Pacific. So let's go down to the Pacific Theater. Starting the year in January, the Allies are able to take the Island of Luzon. In particular, they're able to take Manila."
Social Studies,"Then, as we go into February, they began the invasion of Iwo Jima, which is an incredibly bloody campaign. You have 70,000 marines invade the island verus 22,000 Japanese troops. On top of that you obviously have air, you have the Air Force involved, you have the Navy involved, but I guess what's even more mind-boggling, you have significant Allied deaths. You have 7,000 deaths on the Allied side, but even more amazing, out of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers that were defending Iwo Jima, 19,000 get killed."
Social Studies,"So 19,000 of 22,000 Japanese soldiers get killed. So you can imagine how bloody this is. And this picture, which is probably one of the most famous military photos ever taken, especially in the United States, this was taken of Marines storming a hill, storming a mountain in Iwo Jima. And just to imagine how bloody these things are. I just gave you some of the numbers."
Social Studies,"Even this photo, which is a real photograph, even this photo, where it looks like hey look, the Americans have at least taken this mountain or this hill right over here, even out of this photo, three of these Marines die in the next few days as they continue to try to take Iwo Jima or take the entire island. So you can imagine the Japanese were able to mount a ferocious defense of the island. They aren't able to fully take the island until we get into March."
Social Studies,"So by March, so maybe I'll say February to March you have the invasion of Iwo Jima. Now the whole time that this is happening, you have B-29s firebombing major cities in Japan, and especially Tokyo. So once again, these cities are really being destroyed. This is all-out war. But still the Japanese have not surrendered. So in April, actually April going into June, you have to remember April in Europe, this is when it was pretty much done with. Hitler commits suicide in April."
Social Studies,"But in April going into June of 1945, you have the Allied invasion of Okinawa, which once again, is an incredibly bloody campaign. You have above and beyond the tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers that get killed at Okinawa, you have tens and tens of thousands of civilians who get killed or commit suicide. So once again, this is all very unpleasant and very bloody. But we continue on, and still the Japanese have not surrendered."
Social Studies,"Although even in 1944, their navy is all but destroyed, but they're mounting this ferocious defense. In parallel to all of this, the Allies, especially the U.S., has had the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons, and they decide to use them, Truman is now president, in order to accelerate the end of the war. And so in August 6th, they drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, essentially destroying that city."
Social Studies,"And it's interesting to read accounts of how the Japanese learned about it or what they didn't learn about it, obviously. Obviously no one was expecting bombs that could just obliterate a city, literally, in seconds. Still, there wasn't a surrender from the Japanese, and so, let me write this. This is August 6th, and so on August 9th, you have another atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. At the same time that this is happening, you have the Soviet Union invading Manchuria."
Social Studies,"You have the Soviet Union invading Manchuria, and so enough was enough. You have the Soviets who are now getting involved in the Pacific, the Americans seem to be able to literally destroy Japanese cities at will, and so on August 14, 1945, you have the Japanese surrender. Japanese surrender, and then this does not become truly official until September 2, 1945, which is called VJ Day, Victory in Japan Day. That marks the real end of World War II."
Social Studies,"Obviously, World War II ended at the end of April, May, officially early May in Europe, but now in early September it is officially ended in the Pacific as well. And the Allies are victorious.."
Social Studies,"And this is really just going to be an overview. People can do a whole PhD thesis on this type of thing. Capitalism, and then I'll get a little bit more-- and then we could progress to socialism. And then we can go to communism. And the modern versions of communism are really kind of the brainchild of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. Karl Marx was a German philosopher in the 1800s, who, in his Communist Manifesto and other writings, kind of created the philosophical underpinnings for communism."
Social Studies,"And Vladimir Lenin, who led the Bolshevik Revolution in the-- and created, essentially, the Soviet Union-- he's the first person to make some of Karl Marx's ideas more concrete. And really every nation or every country which we view as communist has really followed the pattern of Vladimir Lenin. And we'll talk about that in a second. But first, let's talk about the philosophical differences between these things, and how you would move."
Social Studies,"And Karl Marx himself viewed communism as kind of a progression from capitalism through socialism to communism. So what he saw in capitalism-- and at least this part of what he saw was right-- is that you have private property, private ownership of land. That's the main aspect of capitalism. And this is the world that most of us live in today."
Social Studies,"The problem that he saw with capitalism is he thought, well, look, when you have private property, the people who start accumulating some capital-- and when we talk about capital, we could be talking about land, we could be talking about factories, we could be talking about any type of natural resources-- so the people who start getting a little bit of them-- so let me draw a little diagram here. So let's say someone has a little bit of capital. And that capital could be a factory, or it could be land."
Social Studies,"So let me write it. Capital. And let's just say it's land. So let's say someone starts to own a little bit of land. And he owns more than everyone else. So then you just have a bunch of other people who don't own land. But they need, essentially-- and since this guy owns all the land, they've got to work on this guy's land. They have to work on this guy's land. And from Karl Marx's point of view, he said, look, you have all of these laborers who don't have as much capital. This guy has this capital."
Social Studies,"And so he can make these laborers work for a very small wage. And so any excess profits that come out from this arrangement, the owner of the capital will be able to get it. Because these laborers won't be able to get their wages to go up. Because there's so much competition for them to work on this guy's farm or to work on this guy's land. He really didn't think too much about, well, maybe the competition could go the other way."
Social Studies,"Maybe you could have a reality eventually where you have a bunch of people with reasonable amounts of capital, and you have a bunch of laborers. And the bunch of people would compete for the laborers, and maybe the laborers could make their wages go up, and they could eventually accumulate their own capital. They could eventually start their own small businesses. So he really didn't think about this reality too much over here. He just saw this reality."
Social Studies,"And to his defense-- and I don't want to get in the habit of defending Karl Marx too much-- to his defense, this is what was happening in the late 1800s, especially-- we have the Industrial Revolution. Even in the United States, you did have kind of-- Mark Twain called it the Gilded Age. You have these industrialists who did accumulate huge amounts of capital. They really did have a lot of the leverage relative to the laborers."
Social Studies,"And so what Karl Marx says, well, look, if the guy with all the capital has all the leverage, and this whole arrangement makes some profits, he's going to be able to keep the profits. Because he can keep all of these dudes' wages low. And so what's going to happen is that the guy with the capital is just going to end up with more capital. And he's going to have even more leverage. And he'll be able to keep these people on kind of a basic wage, so that they can never acquire capital for themselves."
Social Studies,"So in Karl Marx's point of view, the natural progression would be for these people to start organizing. So these people maybe start organizing into unions. So they could collectively tell the person who owns the land or the factory, no, we're not going to work, or we're going to go on strike unless you increase our wages, or unless you give us better working conditions. So when you start talking about this unionization stuff, you're starting to move in the direction of socialism."
Social Studies,"The other element of moving in the direction of socialism is that Karl Marx didn't like this kind of high concentration-- or this is socialists in general, I should say-- didn't like this high concentration of wealth."
Social Studies,"That you have this reality of not only do you have these people who could accumulate all of this wealth-- and maybe, to some degree, they were able to accumulate it because they were innovative, or they were good managers of land, or whatever, although the Marxists don't give a lot of credit to the owners of capital. They don't really give a lot of credit to saying maybe they did have some skill in managing some type of an operation. But the other problem is is that it gets handed over."
Social Studies,"It gets handed over to their offspring. So private property, you have this situation where it just goes from maybe father to son, or from parent to a child. And so it's not even based on any type of meritocracy. It's really just based on this inherited wealth. And this is a problem that definitely happened in Europe."
Social Studies,"When you go back to the French Revolution, you have generation after generation of nobility, regardless of how incompetent each generation would be, they just had so much wealth that they were essentially in control of everything. And you had a bunch of people with no wealth having to work for them. And when you have that type of wealth disparity, it does lead to revolutions. So another principle of moving in the socialist direction is kind of a redistribution of wealth. So let me write it over here."
Social Studies,"So redistribution. So in socialism, you can still have private property. But the government takes a bigger role. So you have-- let me write this. Larger government. And one of the roles of the government is to redistribute wealth. And the government also starts having control of the major factors of production."
Social Studies,"So maybe the utilities, maybe some of the large factories that do major things, all of a sudden starts to become in the hands of the government, or in the words of communists, in the hands of the people. And the redistribution is going on, so in theory, you don't have huge amounts of wealth in the hands of a few people. And then you keep-- if you take these ideas to their natural conclusion, you get to the theoretical communist state."
Social Studies,"And the theoretical communist state is a classless, and maybe even a little bit-- a classless society, and in Karl Marx's point of view-- and this is a little harder to imagine-- a stateless society. So in capitalism, you definitely had classes. You had the class that owns the capital, and then you had the labor class, and you have all of these divisions, and they're different from each other."
Social Studies,"He didn't really imagine a world that maybe a laborer could get out of this, they could get their own capital, then maybe they could start their own business. So he just saw this tension would eventually to socialism, and eventually a classless society where you have a central-- Well, he didn't even go too much into the details but you have kind of equal, everyone in society has ownership over everything, and society somehow figures out where things should be allocated, and all of the rest."
Social Studies,And it's all stateless. And that's even harder to think about in a concrete fashion. So that's Karl Marx's view of things. But it never really became concrete until Vladimir Lenin shows up. And so the current version of communism that we-- The current thing that most of us view as communism is sometimes viewed as a Marxist-Leninist state. These are sometimes used interchangeably.
Social Studies,"Marxism is kind of the pure, utopian, we're eventually going to get to a world where everyone is equal, everyone is doing exactly what they want, there's an abundance of everything. I guess to some degree, it's kind of describing what happens in Star Trek, where everyone can go to a replicator and get what they want. And if you want to paint part of the day, you can paint part of the day, and you're not just a painter, you can also do whatever you want. So it's this very utopian thing."
Social Studies,"Let me write that down. So pure Marxism is kind of a utopian society. And just in case you don't know what utopian means, it's kind of a perfect society, where you don't have classes, everyone is equal, everyone is leading these kind of rich, diverse, fulfilling lives. And it's also, utopian is also kind of viewed as unrealistic. It's kind of, if you view it in the more negative light, is like, hey, I don't know how we'll ever be able to get there. Who knows? I don't want to be negative about it."
Social Studies,"Maybe we will one day get to a utopian society. But Leninist is kind of the more practical element of communism. Because obviously, after the Bolshevik Revolution, 1917, in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union gets created, they have to actually run a government. They have to actually run a state based on these ideas of communism. And in a Leninist philosophy-- and this is where it starts to become in tension with the ideas of democracy-- in a Leninist philosophy, you need this kind of a party system."
Social Studies,"So you need this-- and he calls this the Vanguard Party. So the vanguard is kind of the thing that's leading, the one that's leading the march. So this Vanguard Party that kind of creates this constant state of revolution, and its whole job is to guide society, is to kind of almost be the parent of society, and take it from capitalism through socialism to this ideal state of communism. And it's one of those things where the ideal state of communism was never-- it's kind of hard to know when you get there."
Social Studies,"And so what happens in a Leninist state is it's this Vanguard Party, which is usually called the Communist Party, is in a constant state of revolution, kind of saying, hey, we're shepherding the people to some future state without a real clear definition of what that future state is."
Social Studies,"And so when you talk about Marxist-Leninist, besides talking about what's happening in the economic sphere, it's also kind of talking about this party system, this party system where you really just have one dominant party that it will hopefully act in the interest of the people. So one dominant communist party that acts in the interest of the people."
Social Studies,"And obviously, the negative here is that how do you know that they actually are acting in the interest of people? How do you know that they actually are competent? What means are there to do anything if they are misallocating things, if it is corrupt, if you only have a one-party system? And just to make it clear, the largest existing communist state is the People's Republic of China. And although it is controlled by the Communist Party, in economic terms it's really not that communist anymore."
Social Studies,"And so it can be confusing. And so what I want to do is draw a little bit of a spectrum. On the vertical axis, over here, I want to put democratic. And up here, I'll put authoritarian or totalitarian. Let me put-- well, I'll put authoritarian. I'll do another video on the difference. And they're similar. And totalitarian is more an extreme form of authoritarian, where the government controls everything. And you have a few people controlling everything and it's very non-democratic."
Social Studies,"But authoritarian is kind of along those directions. And then on this spectrum, we have the capitalism, socialism, and communism. So the United States, I would put-- I would put the United States someplace over here. I would put the United States over here. It has some small elements of socialism. You do have labor unions. They don't control everything. You also have people working outside of labor unions. It does have some elements of redistribution. There are inheritance taxes."
Social Studies,"There are-- I mean it's not an extreme form of redistribution. You can still inherit private property. You still have safety nets for people, you have Medicare, Medicaid, you have welfare. So there's some elements of socialism. But it also has a very strong capitalist history, private property, deep market, so I'd stick the United States over there. I would put the USSR-- not current Russia, but the Soviet Union when it existed-- I would put the Soviet Union right about there."
Social Studies,"So this was the-- I would put the USSR right over there. I would put the current state of Russia, actually someplace over here. Because they actually have fewer safety nets, and they kind of have a more-- their economy can kind of go crazier, and they actually have a bigger disparity in wealth than a place like the United States. So this is current Russia."
Social Studies,"And probably the most interesting one here is the People's Republic of China, the current People's Republic of China, which is at least on the surface, a communist state. But in some ways, it's more capitalist than the United States, in that they don't have strong wealth redistribution. They don't have kind of strong safety nets for people. So you could put some elements of China-- and over here, closer to the left."
Social Studies,"And they are more-- less democratic than either the US or even current Russia, although some people would call current Russia-- well, I won't go too much into it. But current China, you could throw it here a little bit. So it could be even a little bit more capitalist than the United States. Definitely they don't even have good labor laws, all the rest. But in other ways, you do have state ownership of a lot, and you do have state control of a lot."
Social Studies,"So in some ways, they're kind of spanning this whole range. So this right over here is China. And even though it is called a communist state, in some ways, it's more capitalist than countries that are very proud of their capitalism. But in a lot of other ways, especially with the government ownership and the government control of things, and this one dominant party, so it's kind of Leninist with less of the Marxist going on. So in that way, it is more in the communist direction."
Social Studies,So hopefully that clarifies what can sometimes be a confusing topic..
Social Studies,"So the Japanese are essentially this colonial, this imperialist power here. And they stay in power in the Korean peninsula all the way until the end of World War II. And it's probably worth saying here-- and it's probably worth making and doing a bunch of videos here-- that the Japanese occupation was not a pleasant occupation for the Korean people. They subjugated the Korean people in multiple ways. Forced labor, forced prostitution. They tried to eradicate the Korean language and the Korean culture."
Social Studies,"So this was not in any way a pleasant occupation. They weren't pleasant imperialists. But you fast forward all the way to 1945, we know that Japan loses World War II. And the major two victors on the Allied side, that are kind of acting in this part of the world, are the United States and the Soviet Union. And so in 1945, you have the Soviets coming from above. That's the Soviets, coming from above. And eventually, you have the Americans coming from below. They occupy Japan first. So this is the USA."
Social Studies,"And they essentially, remember at this point, even though this is kind of the beginning of the Cold War, at this point in World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union are allies. And so United States tells us the Soviet Union, hey, why don't we just stop at the 38th parallel? The United States actually didn't even think that the Soviets would stop there, but they actually did."
Social Studies,"And from the Soviet's point of view, it's believed that they stopped there, because the United States didn't get there at the same time. So there was no one to stop them from going further South. But it's believed that the Soviets wanted to uphold their side of the agreement so that they would be a trusted party to negotiations in Europe, and maybe get more in Europe, which is what the Soviets maybe cared about more."
Social Studies,"So what happens after World War II is that the North, what is now North Korea essentially, becomes under the influence of the Soviets. Everything below the 38th parallel becomes under the influence of the United States. The Soviets essentially install this gentleman right over here to lead North Korea-- Kim Il Sung-- or the part of Korea that is north of the 38th parallel. At this point, this was just kind of viewed as a point where the Soviets and the United States should meet up."
Social Studies,"Where they would have to stop. It wasn't meant to be an actual partition of the country. But as we'll see, it actually becomes a partition of the country. But the Soviets install Kim Il Sung. He sets up a communist, essentially a communist dictatorship in the North. And this is the current leader of North Korea's dad. This is Kim Jong Il's dad. So he gets installed in the North. And in the South, if you fast forward a little bit to 1948, there's an attempt at elections."
Social Studies,"But those elections are seriously rigged. And this gentleman, Syngman Rhee, comes to power. And although he might look like a nice, pleasant man, he was actually fairly ruthless. And he is unanimously considered a strong man. And on both sides-- and so once again, this is one of those situations where you really can't call either of these guys good guys because both of them have done some pretty nasty, nasty things to each other, to soldiers on either side, and to innocent civilians."
Social Studies,"But Syngman Rhee comes to power in the south, and his, I guess, most attractive feature to the Americans is that he is not a communist. And so you have this situation setting up communist North above 38th parallel. Non-communist South, controlled by Syngman Rhee, supported by the United States. The other thing that happens is that the Soviets help build up the North Korean military. The United States is not as encouraging of a strong South Korean military."
Social Studies,"So you start having an imbalance between the military of the North and the South. And obviously, either one of these parties, Kim Il Sung wants to unite Korea under his rule, under his communist rule. Syngman Rhee wants to unite Korea under his authoritarian rule. So they're both setting up the troops along the border. And this whole time you have skirmishes going on across the border. And just to give you a context, you're probably saying, wait, Korea is right next to China."
Social Studies,"What was going on there? And if you go to China, in 1949, the Communists come to power. There was a civil war leading up to that between the Communists led by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek. Mao Zedong comes to power. He wants to support the communists in North Korea, especially because some of those communists in North Korea actually helped fight on the communist side during the Chinese Civil War. So this is an important factor right here."
Social Studies,"Mao Zedong is interested in spreading Communism. He doesn't like the Americans in South Korea, and he feels some type of allegiance to the communists in North Korea. So now you fast forward to June 25, 1950. And in the North, you have a major event. The North Korean army-- and it's not called North Korea at this point-- they both consider themselves Korea, competing, I guess, governments of Korea. The army in the North is disproportionately stronger than the South, and so they invade."
Social Studies,"They view this as their chance at unifying the peninsula. And essentially, they're able to almost just storm through the Korean peninsula. Immediately, when that happens, the UN, and especially the United States-- and this is because at this point, the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council, so they couldn't even veto it-- the UN immediately starts supplying naval and air support for the South Koreans. But the disparity is so big that the North Koreans are able to just keep marching forward."
Social Studies,"Within a few days, literally by July 1, the United States decides to commit ground forces, because we had substantial ground forces in Japan, which isn't that far away. Just to give you a global perspective, this is the Korean peninsula right here. And this is Japan. I know I could have probably found a bigger picture of that. But America had military forces in Japan that they could send, and so the Americans enter the battle in a major way, very early on."
Social Studies,"But that doesn't stop the North Koreans for some time. So the North Koreans get all the way, they're able to occupy all of the Korean peninsula, except for the northeastern corner. So they get around this far. Over here, you have the city of Pusan. And this is called the Pusan Perimeter. And it's at the Pusan Perimeter that you have a little bit of a, the United States and Korean forces combined are able to halt the North Koreans. And you have a slight stalemate for a couple of months here."
Social Studies,"But while that stalemate is happening, the United States is able to-- and especially the UN, but it's mainly the United States-- is able to build up significant troops within the Pusan Perimeter. But even more, and at this point, the United States and the UN forces, go under the control of Douglas MacArthur, General Douglas MacArthur, who's a bit of an interesting character. Until this point, he was able to rule Japan with an iron fist."
Social Studies,"He's a hugely popular war hero in America, and the current president, Truman, kind of has a little trouble controlling MacArthur, especially during the Korean War. And we'll see that MacArthur really oversteps his bounds during the course of this war. Now, at this point, you have the South Koreans and the Americans kind of cornered down here inside of the Pusan Perimeter. It looks like North Korea's on the verge of victory. But the US is able to build forces."
Social Studies,"And the Korean War really just starts becoming into a game of Risk. I don't know if you've ever played the game of Risk, but whenever it's somebody's turn, they're able to spread their forces. But then they get spread thin, and then the other side's able to come back. And what we'll see is the rest of the Korean War is essentially a back and forth between the Communists in the North-- supported by the Chinese, although the Chinese aren't in the war officially just yet-- and then the Americans in the South."
Social Studies,"And the first really smart thing that MacArthur does is he says, look, instead of trying to fight our way through the Korean forces that are over here, why don't we just kind of outflank them? And why don't we use our navy to do an amphibious landing of an army at Incheon? So on September 15, while you have the stalemate over here, the United States, they have an amphibious landing. So they send troops from all of these places. They have an amphibious landing at Incheon, which is near Seoul."
Social Studies,"So they land right over, they land at Incheon, which is roughly over there. I'm not super accurate here. And what's interesting about that is, in any battle, all of these Korean troops right here, they have supply chains. They have to get food and supplies and fresh troops from up here. And so the further in you go into enemy territory, the more spread out your troops get."
Social Studies,"And the strategy here is instead of fighting through this, what if we outflank them and are able to land a significant force right here, and immediately disrupt the supply lines of the North Koreans. And that's essentially what the Americans did. And it was successful. So MacArthur looks like a genius over here, and he's able to retake Seoul. He's able to take what's kind of the North Korean capital at this point, Pyongyang, and you have the Americans marching north."
Social Studies,"So all of a sudden, it started off with the North Koreans being able to roll down, and now all of a sudden the Americans and the South Koreans are able to roll up. And they're feeling pretty good about themselves. And the whole time, Truman's trying to keep MacArthur under check. MacArthur is excited. He's ultra confident. He thinks that the troops are going to be home by Christmas."
Social Studies,"He doesn't think China is serious about supporting the North Koreans, and even more, he almost, it seems, like wants to pick a fight with China because he wants to maybe eliminate communism in China as well. He viewed it as he's on this mission to eliminate communism from all of Asia. So Truman is saying limited war. Don't cross the Yalu River, and be careful. Don't start attacking Chinese up here and enrage them, and you're going to have them enter the war. MacArthur doesn't take that too seriously."
Social Studies,"And he also says, look, I have to start bombing bombs across the Yalu River so that the Chinese won't be able to send troops and supplies to aid the North Koreans. So he's marching up, all confident, going up against the Yalu River. And this whole time, the Chinese, under Mao Zedong, are sending a pretty substantial army. And they're able to do it secretly."
Social Studies,"They're able to march at night, and they even have these policies where if any surveillance planes go overhead, all of the Chinese soldiers have to freeze. And if they don't freeze, someone else is allowed to shoot them. So everyone wants to freeze so that no one can really see them from above. So it's this really secret buildup of troops across the Yalu River, and this whole time MacArthur is just ultra, ultra confident about what's happening over here."
Social Studies,"But then you fast forward until the end of October, the Americans think that they're on the verge of winning the Korean War. And all of a sudden, you have the Chinese cross the Yalu River. And the Americans didn't even know that the Chinese had major forces ready to cross. And once again, it's just like a game of Risk. Now you have the Chinese cross. They catch the Americans unsuspected. They engage a few times. The Americans weren't sure if the Chinese were serious."
Social Studies,"So they keep re-engaging them, but it becomes clear, yes the Chinese are serious. And essentially the Chinese are able to push back the Americans and the South Koreans all the way back so that they are able to recapture Seoul. But once again, like any game of Risk, now the Chinese are spread thin. The Americans and the South Koreans, and all the other UN forces-- although the UN forces are mainly the Americans-- are able to regroup."
Social Studies,"And then, in March-- so Seoul has changed hands four times-- so in March, they're able to retake Seoul again. And at this point, MacArthur is ultra confident. He's telling the Chinese, you've essentially lost. He's even trying to get permissions to use nuclear weapons against the Chinese. To some degree, he doesn't even think he needs the permission of Truman to stop. It sounds like he's eager to push the Chinese further back, even though they surprised him the first go around."
Social Studies,"So Truman has enough of this wild card guy, who thinks that he can call the shots and use nuclear weapons if he wants to, willy nilly. And so Truman finally dismisses MacArthur in April of 1951. And at this point, you start having a stalemate near the 38th parallel. So that you start having a stalemate across this border right over there. And both sides think the end of the war is imminent. They're like, OK, we're back to where we both began. We should both stop here."
Social Studies,"But the negotiations, unfortunately, took over two years. And there was a lot of back and forth about what to do with prisoners of war and all of the rest. But it finally took two years so that on July 27, 1953, you have an armistice signed between the two parties. And I want to make it clear, an armistice agreement, it is not a peace treaty. It is not saying that we both agree that this is the border of our two new countries and that we are now at peace with each other."
Social Studies,"All an armistice means is that we're going to stop fighting. It is not a formal end to the war. So in theory, North and South Korea, even to this day, are in a state of war. And to this day, I'm recording this video in 2011. Maybe if you view this in the future, hopefully they won't be in an official state of war. But they're in an official state of war under an armistice. They've just agreed to stop fighting."
Social Studies,"So all in all, you have this hugely bloody battle with all of these atrocities going on on both sides. Syngman Rhee when he was, the first time when the North Korean troops were rolling in to South Korea, he essentially, beforehand, he was imprisoning a bunch of people who he suspected to be communists. We're not talking about people, I'm talking about whole families sometimes."
Social Studies,"And when he was retreating, he essentially allowed the massacre of a huge number of people who were just suspected of being communists. These weren't just military men. These were women. These were children. These were entire families, so he is guilty of that. And Kim Il Sung just as guilty when the North Korean soldiers infiltrated South Korea in Seoul, they committed atrocities killing civil servants, killing any of the established intellectuals in the area. So on both sides. This hugely horrific war."
Social Studies,"And just to get a sense of what was happening. Korea isn't a huge country, but you have within Korea, the civilian deaths, 1.5 to 3 million civilian deaths and the consensus is at 2 million. And this tells you how ugly war is that you can't even estimate how many people died to the nearest 500,000 people. You just don't know what happened. Two million people died in a country that's not too big. All in all, you have about 40,000 American soldiers dying."
Social Studies,"China loses on the order of, depending on the estimates, 400,000 soldiers. I mean the estimates are all over the place. North Korea loses, on the order, same magnitude of soldiers. South Korea loses several hundred thousand soldiers. So you have this hugely bloody battle, this hugely bloody war, I should say, that really ends with an outcome that wasn't so different from where it started.."
Social Studies,"So this is after he's already had, you know, the Bay of Pigs has happened, the Cuban Missle Crisis has happened. He is not a big fan of Fidel Castro. But with that said, in hindsight, JFK did say this. This is pretty objective assessment of what Batista was like as the dictator of Cuba. This is John F."
Social Studies,"Kennedy saying this: ""I believe there is no country in the world including any and all the countries under colonial domination, where economic colonization, humiliation and exploitation were worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my country's policies during the Batista regime. To some extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the United States."
Social Studies,"Now we shall have to pay for those sins."" So even JFK in hindsight is saying that Batista was really not the best person and it really was not a good idea for the United States to support such a corrupt dictator for so long in Cuba. This is Batista right over here, riding with some U.S. generals in a parade when he visited DC. So you can imagine he was not a popular person in control of Cuba and in 1959 you have a successful revolution against him."
Social Studies,"In 1959 there is a revolution and the revolution is led by this character, Fidel Castro, and his kind of two right hand men are Raul Castro and Che Guevara right over here and they take control of Cuba. They're part of this nationalist, revolutionary movement. Now the one thing they do do, and they are left-leaning from the beginning, people assume that they are maybe communists or quasi-communists."
Social Studies,"But even from the get-go as soon as they take power, they start taking over lands that were owned by, well, one that was private Cuban property, some of it that was United States property."
Social Studies,"Their arguement would have probably been that this was wealth, private property that was ill gotten, that was gotten in the time of Batista, but they did in a broad sweep , so they took over a lot of private land, a lot of private property, which also led to people thinking hey, this is not just a nationalist revolution, this is also a communist revolution but you could also imagine that once they take over there this huge migration of Cubans to the United States and there, it's primarily middle class, upper middle class Cubans, educated Cubans, who were really afraid of what Fidel Castro is doing in terms of taking over of private land, taking people's property."
Social Studies,"So you start having this Cuban exile community really focused around Florida and mainly Miami and they're still there. And they're very unhappy with this Fidel Castro character right over here. So when we fast forward into 1961 John F. Kennedy becomes president, He gets elected in 1960, becomes president in early 1961. We're now fast forwarding to April, 1961 so JFK has only been president for a few months."
Social Studies,"But you can imagine a lot of levels you have all of these Cuban exiles, upper middled class, educated, middle class, Cuban exiles who hate Fidel Castro. He's taking over their land he's turning it into what looks like a leftist state. This is all happening within the context of the cold war, the US is afraid of countries falling to communism."
Social Studies,"It looks like Fidel Castro is a communist, so the US decides the fact that you have all of the exisles who wanna oust him to the US porbably wants to oust him just because he's a communist and they're afraid that he's going to align himself with the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"So in conjunction with the Cuban exiles and the CIA, and this right here is the director of the Central Intelligence during the Kennedy administration or at least the beginning part of the Kennedy administration, this is Allen Dulles, his brother is John Foster Dulles, where Dulles Airport is named after and he was a US Secretary of State."
Social Studies,"They decide that they want to oust Fidel Castro, but they want to do it in a way that the US does not look like it's the one doing the invasion, so what they do is they plan an invasion where they take Cuban exiles and they get 1400 men to sign up to be kind of part of this CIA backed , US backed force to invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro."
Social Studies,"And a lot of this was based on the premise, and you can imagine this even happened in the iraq war, where the CIA, the American President, they kind of surround themselves with people who tell them, who one give them a very optimistic, hopeful scenario telling them ""Look."
Social Studies,"We represent what the rest of the Cuban people want,"" They'll say, ""Look if we just start a revolution Fidel Castro will be overthrown."" The reality that came out, at least at that point in time, in early 1960's, Fidel Castro was actually pretty popular with the Cuban people and you can imagine he was at that time popular with the poor people who did not have land and now all of the sudden you have this leader for the people, I don't know about his popularity now but at that point he was probably a lot more popular than the exiles and the CIA would have had Kennedy believe."
Social Studies,"So they plan this attack Kennedy says oh, if we can get rid of Fidel Castro then that derisks the possibility of having this communist nation right off of the Florida coast. So they plan this invasion and you know it's shady to begin with because they didn't want to make it look like an official U.S. invasion."
Social Studies,"They wanted to make it look like a pure Cuban counter-revolution and to some degree that really mixed up everything and made it look, and well it really was suspect because they really were doing something that was not what it really was."
Social Studies,"But the invasion the way it all worked out is that by April 15th, and this is just going into the details of the invasion, So they had the fourteen hundred exiles They had some ships, some planes they marked them They either removed the markings so that it didn't look like they were American ships or planes Or they put false markings of the Cuban military So that it would cause some confusion or whatever So on April 15, 1961, Remember this is only a few months into Kennedy's administration, they start air attacks and these air attacks launch from Nicaragua and they go to Cuba."
Social Studies,"And the whole point of these air attacks was to kind of soften the Cuban Air Force for an eventual invasion by the 1400 exiles. And so they have eight aircraft, eight bombers leaving Nicaragua. They bomb Cuba at a base outside of Havana and a base near the south, actually not too far from the current Guantanamo Bay. And the point or their goal was to destroy the Cuban Air Force It turns out they didn't do it. And once again, to kind of cause confusion, they did it not under the U.S."
Social Studies,"markings, but they put Cuban Air Force markings on the planes. You had eight planes going and doing the bombing One of them gets shot down and a ninth plane actually leaves from Nicaragua and they falsely put bullet holes in it to look like it was hit with anti-aircraft guns and had it defect to Florida."
Social Studies,"So I guess the idea behind this was to make it look like there is a Cuban pilot who takes off from Cuba or somehow gets out of Cuba with a Cuban plane (that's why they put the markings there) and then tries to destroy a bunch of Cuban aircraft and then defects to the United States. That's the impression that they wanted to convey. It's not so clear that the Cubans actually fell for it. And so that happened in 1961. Most everyone kind of saw this as a U.S. attack, or at least said they viewed it as a U.S."
Social Studies,attack. Then you fast forward to the night of April 16th and this whole time everyone was expecting a US attack This all leads to the fact that this was not a well orchestrated series of events It's pretty well established that some of these exiles were just not as tightlipped as they should have been about the invasion. It got out to Soviet intelligence. The Cubans knew that an invasion was imminent.
Social Studies,"So on April 16th you have kind of a false attack - a decoy attack - at Bahia Honda right over here, with a bunch of decoy boats with loudspeakers on them that made it sound like they were firing to cause confusion and it did temporarily cause Castro to look in that direction because they were on hair trigger notice expecting an imminent invasion that was not the real one."
Social Studies,"This was on the evening of April 16th When you go to the early morning of April 17th you have the real invasion where you have the 1400 Cuban exiles with CIA and US military support (but all of that was hidden ) to actually invade at the Bay of Pigs. And to make a long story short it was kind of a invasion that did not go well. It has been blamed on bad planning, on incompetance at some parts of the invasion. The invasion lasted from April 17th which was the first day of the invasion."
Social Studies,"By April 19th the invading force, or counter-revolutionary force, the 1400 cuban exiles, had been pushed back to the beaches. And for the most part a little over 100 of them were killed and most of them, over 1000 of them, were captured."
Social Studies,"And then later on in the year Fidel Castro, - and some were executed after after being captured - but later on in the year Fidel Castro makes a deal with the United States where he hands over the captured exiles to the United States in exchange for $58 million in aid and supplies and all the rest. So this, at least from a military point of view, was a complete debacle from the United States point of view."
Social Studies,You can imagine after this happened people in the United States started pointing fingers You have the CIA (and this is Allen Dulles right here) and the exiles blaming the Kennedy administration saying that look he wasn't willing to do what it takes to actually do a proper invasion. He wasn't willing to supply the proper air support once the invasion started happening. He was not willing to commit more U.S. troops once the invasion started looking like it was not going in the direction of the exiles.
Social Studies,"Kennedy on the other hand blames the CIA. He says look this was just done and planned incompetently He also says that ""You gave me all sorts of misinformation."
Social Studies,"You told me that once the invasion started there was all sorts of resentment against Fidel Castro and it would cause this broader uprising, which never ever happened."" This is actually a quote from John F Kennedy that he said after the Bay of Pigs invasion: ""The first advice I am going to give to my successor is to watch the generals and to avoid the feeling that because they were military men their opinions on military matters were worth a damn."" This is John F."
Social Studies,"Kennedy saying this after the Bay of Pigs invasion. You can dig deeper and figure out who probably was in the right here, but the bottom line here is that it lead to all-round negative consequences for the United States. After this kind of strengthened Fidel Castro's hold on Cuba. He was like, ""Hey that was the United States' best shot."" Huge embarrassment for them. It allowed his to concentrate his control."
Social Studies,It also caused him to now become very openly communist Before the Bay of pigs invasion he was kind of trying to get the U.S. to somewhat like him. Although they wouldn't like him because he was taking over private property and he was clearly left-leaning. But after the Bay of Pigs invasion he definitely aligned himself closely with the Soviet Union.
Social Studies,"He became much more open about being a Marxist, Leninist, communist state and because he as afraid of future US invasions he was open to what eventually leads to the Cuban Missile Crisis which is the Soviet Union actually placing ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads in Cuba at short range to the United States. It set up this whole series of events that really didn't work in the U.S.'s favor.."
Social Studies,"Cuba is now a Communist nation right off of the coast of the United States. This is the middle of the Cold War. The U.S. believes in a strategy of containment, does not like this. So in 1961, the United States, the CIA, the Kennedy Administration, they try using Cuban exiles, people who have left Cuba, they try to support them to enter and invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. But, the whole effort wasn't planned properly."
Social Studies,"The support for the Cuban exiles, the counter-revolutionaries, those [who] were trying to oust Castro, it was kind of this half-hearted effort. And it was this big failure. So the Bay of Bigs invasion was a failure in 1961. And it made John F. Kennedy seem a little bit weak. It made the CIA seem [weak]. It didn't make anyone on the American side look all that competent, because of that failure. On top of that, we're in the middle of the Cold War, remember this."
Social Studies,"And at the same time, if you go to what the US was doing around the Soviet Union, it started placing missiles, starting [in] the late 50's, all the way into 1961 and 1962 --- it started placing medium-ranged ballistic missiles in Turkey and in Italy. These are where they were allocated. And the significance of that is that now these missiles could reach the major population centers of the Soviet Union in really a matter of minutes, in 10 to 20 minutes, I think."
Social Studies,"16 minutes was how long most of these stayed airborne. And in a situation where both sides have nuclear weapons, there was this kind of notion of well, maybe if you're able to get to the other guy faster, they wouldn't be able to retaliate, and maybe you wouldn't have that mutually assured destruction."
Social Studies,"So there's this whole idea that you want to get your missiles as close as possible [to your enemies] so that they could reach the populations centers, the strategic centers of your opponent, as quickly as possible. And if you look up on the Web, you can actually find the actual missile sites, and where they were installed, and when they became operational. These are the ones that were in Italy, kind of right here, near the heel of Italy."
Social Studies,"So you have this environment, the United States was looking a little bit weak after the Bay of Pigs invasion. It looks like they wanted to oust Castro, but they weren't able to do it. They weren't able because they were slightly inept. And at the same time you could imagine that the Soviet Union did not appreciate the United States placing these missiles so close to its population centers. Missiles that could reach its population centers very easily."
Social Studies,"So now, we fast forward to October of 1962 and the entire Cuban Missile Crisis will occur over 13 or 14 days during October of 1962. So, on the 14th of October we're sending these U2 spy planes over Cuba. So this right here is a U2 spy plane. That is a U2 spy plane. And it takes pictures that look like this. And on the next day, on October 15th, you have the CIA analysts. And they're saying, ""Wow - that looks like missiles over there."
Social Studies,"This looks like ballistic missiles that are being set up, that are being set up in Cuba"". And so all of a sudden, it looks like the Soviet Union is using Cuba to do the same thing that we used Turkey and Italy for, to set up ballistic missiles, really, right off of our coast -- and ballistic missiles that could now now reach any of the strategic population centers, especially on the east coast or the midwest of the United States. So by the 16th-- So this is literally two days after the pictures were taken."
Social Studies,"The next day, they're analyzing them, [and] they tell the State Department about them. [On] the 16th, they tell Kennedy about them, and Kennedy holds a meeting of the Executive Committee. It wasn't called ""ExComm,"" just [yet]. But it was really a subset of special advisors -- a subset of the National Security Council and other advisors that essentially become the brain trust to figure out what to do about this forming crisis."
Social Studies,"Because of all of a sudden you have a state that we don't like off of our borders -- a Communist state -- a state aligned with the Soviet Union. All of a sudden, it has nuclear missiles. it looks like these are offensive weapons. These are weapons being designed for a first-strike capability. Once again, if they're being launched from Cuba, maybe they can attack -- maybe they can obliterate the US before the US even has an opportunity to respond properly."
Social Studies,"So this really freaks out the Kennedy Administration. And so they start to think about what can they do about it and early on-- Well, there's a couple-- You could just kind of call and talk to the Soviets about it and say: ""Hey, we don't like that. Why don't you undo your missiles?"" But they didn't really think that that would have any significant effect on the Soviets. Especially, because they probably thought that Kennedy was weak at this point."
Social Studies,"And just to understand who was leading the Soviets at this time, it was Khrushchev. (This is Khrushchev right over here.) And he had even made remarks to the effect that he thought that Kennedy was young and may be naive, and maybe too intellectual to really play a good game of chicken here. And so the US kind of felt that it had to look strong here. And so the only real options on the table were: maybe blockade Cuba - and so a blockade could be an 'all out' blockade, so it would be an economic blockade."
Social Studies,"But then that's actually considered an act of war because you are, to a large degree, starving a country. Another option for the United States, (because it was completely viewed as unacceptable that these missiles should be here, and that they should be deployable from Cuba), the other option would be to do air attacks on these missile silos. And then the most extreme action would be to actually invade Cuba."
Social Studies,"And ,obviously that goes in line with, the US' general interest of not having a communist regime so close to its own borders. So, this is what Kennedy and his team was wrestling with. And really early on in these early days, most of the team was actually advising Kennedy that they should do a full-scale invasion of Cuba. They thought that this was the only thing that the Soviets would take seriously, it would show that the US is serious about this."
Social Studies,"And they didn't think that the Soviet Union would really try to put up a fight in Cuba, so far away from their own borders. But Kennedy, probably thinking about it pretty reasonably, realized ""Well, hey. They might not do anything in Cuba, and they might allow us to oust Castro and install a new regime there. But they might retaliate, in fact, they probably would retaliate in Europe, but specifically, in Berlin, probably in Germany as a whole."
Social Studies,"So, just for the sake of getting these things out of Cuba, we could sacrifice a lot in Europe. And even more, that any type of conflict between the US and the Soviet Union could easily escalate to a nuclear war"". So these were all on the table. The US goes on high alert. It prepares for any of these situations, because they really don't know what's going to happen. The Army, the Air Force and the Navy [start] mobilizing. So, on, kind of with hours notice, any of those options can, kind of, go into effect."
Social Studies,"By the 22nd, you have the Executive Committee -- (And that just becomes formalized as an actual, official group that is advising the President in this capacity.) -- and on the 22nd, Kennedy finally puts out his first salvo on what is the US' position on what's going on here."
Social Studies,"And before this -- just to make things clear -- on the 18th, he did meet, he did meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andrei Gromyko -- and I'm sure I'm butchering the pronunciations -- and this is where the first time, Kennedy is like ""Hey, you've got these offensive weapons..."" And Gromyko is insisting that ""No, they're just defensive weapons""."
Social Studies,"And, to most people, defensive weapons would mean things like surface-to-air missiles, things that would stop planes from bombings. But not surface-to-surface missiles, not something that could attack a country. But we'll see, in future letters from Khrushchev, that maybe they actually did perceive these missiles as somehow being defensive. But you fast forward."
Social Studies,"That was on the 18th, it kind of made, it made Kennedy and the US frustrated with the Russians, because it felt like the Americans are saying, ""Look, we clearly know you have missiles there"", but Gromyko is saying ""No, these are just defensive weapons - nothing to worry about. Why are you taking this so seriously?"" The 19th: US goes on high alert. It starts thinking about all of these options. The 22nd: this Committee is formed formally."
Social Studies,"But more importantly, Kennedy gives a speech to state the United States' opinion. And I'll just read it right here: ""To halt this offensive build-up, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargos of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers."
Social Studies,"We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life, as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948."" So, the Kennedy administration's position became slightly more nuanced. They said ""We can't do an all out blockade. 1) That is an act of war; 2) That is, to a large degree, inhumane. Why should we starve the Cuban people? What we're gonna do is, kind of a filter on the cargo going into Cuba."
Social Studies,"We will only inspect things that we suspect are holding armaments, and we will only turn back the ships that are actually doing it."" But then on the 24th, there is a cable from Khrushchev, and it say,: ""If you cooly weigh the situation which has developed, not giving away to passions, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot fail to reject the arbitrary demands of the United States -- and that the Soviet Union views the blockade as an act of aggression, and that their ships will be instructed to ignore it."" So the game of chicken is beginning to emerge."
Social Studies,"The United States if just saying ""Look, this is unacceptable. We're gonna stop you from shipping arms to Cuba."" On the 24th, Khrushchev is saying ""Who are you to tell us what to do?"" and, you know, there's this kind of under current like, ""Wait, you've already got stuff set up in Italy and Turkey, not too far from us."
Social Studies,"How can you dare..."" -- (you know, and they call it a blockade, even though the US is calling it a quarantine) -- ""this is an act of aggression and we will ignore it."" So both parties are kind of saying, ""We don't care what you're gonna do. We're gonna do what whatever we have to do"" And this whole time, both sides are getting tense, the whole world is kind of taking sides, they're making public statements about what's right or wrong."
Social Studies,"So, we really are getting very close to the brink of a very major confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States. And you know, you can read the book ""13 Days - Robert Kennedy"", there's also the movie ""13 Days,"" which actually is not based on the book. But both of them really kind of give the account of what happened over this period. But then you fast forward to the 25th and Kennedy essentially replies, ""Look, these are offensive weapons and these require the responses I have announced."
Social Studies,"I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit restoration of the earlier situation."" Ok, so he's saying - ""Look, we have to do this. These are offensive weapons. We cannot tolerate these weapons so close to US borders. And so, also on the 25th, the quarantine is in effect. It does get challenged. The US does start to inspect some ships. They try to inspect one ship that got away a little bit. So the Soviets, even though they're speaking the game of chicken, they are turning back."
Social Studies,"They did turn back 14 ships. And the best guess is that those 14 ships probably did contain some type of armament. So even though, publicly, everyone is playing a very strong game, behind the scenes, there is a little bit of a softening of the stance. And then you fast forward to the 26th, and Khrushchev essentially sends his first proposal. And it's interesting here. Because, in Khrushchev's mind -- (And this is a fascinating letter to read."
Social Studies,"It's a fairly long letter, so I'm not gonna go into the whole thing and you can get it at this URL right over here. It's a fascinating letter. Maybe I'll do a whole video where I just read this letter.) He kind of goes into the nuance of what he views as a defensive or an offensive weapon. He implicitly admits that the missiles are there -- That they're not these benign weapons. But, in his letter, he kind of makes the nuance that he'd use them as defensive weapons."
Social Studies,"He says: ""Look, you guys attempted to oust Castro already. We view Castro as an ally. We think that by placing these weapons here, that you will be less likely to be able to oust Castro, because you will be afraid of these weapons."" So, Khrushchev is kind of setting up-- Kruschev is saying, ""We don't have the intention of using these to attack you for no reason. We're just putting these here to essentially defend one of our allies."" So he's saying that's the reason."
Social Studies,"That's the reason that they placed those weapons there in the first place. He's kind of saying ""Look, you did Bay of Pigs. You were the ones that took the first shot. Now we are defending it."" That might have been the rationale. Another rationale for why they did it -- and it's just, and probably the more strategic rationale -- is that we already did have these missiles that were pointed at the Soviet Union in Turkey and Italy. And the Soviet Union just wanted to have parity."
Social Studies,"So, they wanted to put missiles near the US [in] some ally's country, from the Soviet Union's point of view. So, on the 26th, Khrushchev's first proposa,l that was given through a cable, says: ""If assurances were given by the President and the Government of the United States that the USA itself would not participate..."" - so 'assurances'..."
Social Studies,"(Let me underline this in a different color.) -- ""assurances that the USA itself would not participate in an attack on Cuba, and would restrain others from actions of this sort"" -- probably the Cuban exiles -- ""... if you would recall your fleet, this would immediately change everything. I am not speaking for Fidel Castro, but I think that he and the government of Cuba evidently would declare demobilization and would appeal to the people to get down to peaceful labor."
Social Studies,"Then, too, the question of--"" (And, you know, the Communists always like talking about ""labor."") -- ""then, too, the question of armaments would disappear, since, if there is no threat, then armaments are a burden for every people."" So in this first proposal that came over a cable, he's essentially saying: ""Look, if you guys just promise not to attack Cuba, if you just make 'assurances' that you will not attack Cuba, then we'll essentially undo everything."
Social Studies,"We'll give in to your wishes."" And this stance right here really does make it look like their main interest in having those missiles was, kind of, to protect Cuba -- so that the US would not try to oust the Communists from there. But then on the next day, Khrushchev has a public broadcast where he kind of changes his tone a little bit. Now he's saying that they would undo the situation in Cuba only if the United States removed their missiles from Italy and Turkey. So, he's sending little mixed messages."
Social Studies,"His first message was kind of a softer stance: ""Look, you guys just promise not to invade Cuba and we're gonna pull out of Cuba."" The second stance is saying: ""No, no. We're only gonna take our missiles out of Cuba if you take your missiles out of Italy and Turkey."" And on the same day, another U2 spy plane gets shot down over Cuba. This is when both armies are really at, kind of, they're at hair-trigger notice, it's a really scary situation."
Social Studies,"And this was actually done by-- It was a local decision by a Soviet commander. (And Khrushchev actually did not want this to happen.) And lucky for, I guess, the world, the US did not use this, alone, as a reason to engage in war. They said: ""Maybe it's an accident. If this happens again, then we'll use it as [a pretext for] war."" So it was lucky that this did not trigger an immediate war with the Soviets."
Social Studies,"But the Kennedy Administration still had the question: ""Which of these was a more serious, you know, which of these requests were the Soviets really making? This is a more significant request."
Social Studies,"Are they requesting for both? And so it was eventually decided, on the 27th, that: ""Hey, let's just pretend like we didn't even know -- that the Americans didn't even know about the second request that asked for more -- and let's just reply to this first request."" So, you essentially have Kennedy agreeing [with] Khrushchev, and saying: ""Ok, we'll do your first request. We will agree not to invade Cuba if you remove your missiles."" And then, essentially, what happens--."
Social Studies,And that puts Khrushchev in a weird situation. (Because this is something that he did recommend.
Social Studies,"But they were ignoring this over here.) But through back channels we said ""Well, we'll offically agree to this."" But through back channels the Kennedy administration said: ""And we would also be on an understanding, we will also have an understanding on the missiles in Italy and Turkey."" That, ""Look, this isn't part of the deal, but we see what you're saying and we're probably, we're probably going to remove them."" And what the Soviets also didn't know at that time is that the Americans were planning on -- that these missiles, to a large degree, by this point in time, were already obsolete."
Social Studies,"Because we already Polaris missiles that were deployable by submarines. And clearly, submarines can deploy things much closer to the action, and they're much harder to track. You can't surveil them and all the rest. So the US kind of agreed to it. But they did it secretly. And the whole point here is that neither side wanted to look like they're giving in. Neither side wanted to look weak. But on the 28th, there was finally an agreement."
Social Studies,"And so, publicly, the first Khrushchev proposal was agreed to by both Khrushchev and the United States. Khrushchev agreed to remove -- to not send any more weapons, and also dismantle the weapons that were there, and the Americans agreed that they would not invade Cuba. So you can imagine the big winner here. The big winner here is probably Fidel Castro, because the whole time he's paranoid that the US is planning another attack on him."
Social Studies,"And, at least publicly now, they're saying that they cannot invade him. And if they did, it would like they're going back on their word. And privately, the US agreed to remove its missiles from Turkey and Italy. They didn't wanna do this publicly, because then it would like they were being weak. Then it would like the Soviets were able to do this aggressive action. And by doing it, they were able to extract something out of the United States. Which is actually the reality."
Social Studies,"They were able to -- By doing this action, they were able to get these missiles removed from Turkey and Italy. But the United States wanted to look strong. Kennedy has, well -- there's always an approaching election. Especially after the Bay of Pigs, he needed to look like a strong leader. And so, to some degree, you have to give Khrushchev credit for this. He kind of swallowed his pride and allowed it to publicly look like he lost the negotiation."
Social Studies,"He publicly made it look like he got nothing in return for backing down, but in reality he did. He just didn't necessarily get credit for it. But this was a big deal. Because this was the closest that the Soviet Union and the US ever got to really the brink during the Cold War.."
Social Studies,"And France stayed the colonizing power-- I have a little gap in my timeline here-- and they stayed a colonizing power all the way through World War II. And so you can imagine, during World War II, France was quickly overrun by the Germans. The Vietnamese wanted their independence, and so you have a liberation movement that rises up. And it was led by the Viet Minh, and the Viet Minh were led by Ho Chi Minh. This right here is a picture of Ho Chi Minh."
Social Studies,"And besides being a liberation movement, they were also communist, which, you could imagine, later on during the Cold War will kind of bias the United States against them. But you fast forward through World War II. Eventually, the Japanese take control over Indochina, over Vietnam. But by the time '45 rolls around, or at least the end of '45-- and we know that the United States defeats Japan-- now, all of a sudden, the Viet Minh are able to declare a somewhat temporary independence."
Social Studies,"And it's temporary because shortly after that-- and the region is occupied temporarily by the Chinese in the north, and the British in the south, who were part of the Allied forces against the Axis. But eventually, you have the French coming back, and they want to reassert their control over their former colony. And you have this war that develops-- the First Indochina War between the French and the people sympathetic to the French-- the Vietnamese who were loyal to the French-- and the North."
Social Studies,"And the French-- just to make it clear how it sets up, at the end of World War II when you had the temporary occupiers, the British and the Chinese, the Chinese, obviously, had more influence in the North. The British had more influence in the South. When the French come back they, essentially, are able to reinstate control over the South. So right when the Indochina War is beginning, the French already have more control over the South."
Social Studies,"And actually, historically the French had more influence in the South, as well. During French colonial rule it was really the southern third of Vietnam where you had a lot of French influence. And this is a current map, and the current map does not have this orange boundary over here that we'll talk about in a second. Vietnam is now unified. But before the Vietnam War, this was not Ho Chi Minh City, this was Saigon. And Saigon was kind of where most of the French control was centered."
Social Studies,"But you fast forward to 1954, this ends up in a bit of a stalemate. And so you have the Geneva Conference of 1954 that partitions Vietnam along the 17th parallel between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. And the whole point of this partition was, really, to just allow for a cooling off period, a period where you can have thing settling down, and then having elections. It wasn't meant to be a permanent partition. But there was a 300-day period where people could move across the partition."
Social Studies,"And during that partition, you actually had 900,000 people, mainly Catholics, move from the North to South. You also had several hundred thousand people moving from the South to the North, so it wasn't a one-way movement. But net net, most of the movements by Roman Catholic Vietnamese was from the North to the south. You fast forward a little bit, you eventually have-- and I'm sure I'm butchering the pronunciation here-- Ngo Dinh Diem take control."
Social Studies,"He starts off as prime minister in '54, eventually he takes control, and becomes president in '55. This is him right here. He takes control of South Vietnam, and this guy is not a big fan of things like elections, or non-corrupt government, and all the rest. And he takes control of South Vietnam. But you could imagine that the United States is positively inclined to him. One, he dresses in nice Western suits and all of that, and had nicely combed hair. But he was also anti-communist."
Social Studies,"And at this time period, the United States is starting to think in terms of the Cold War. And in terms of, how do we stop communism? How do we contain it? This whole theory of containment-- that the best way to stop the Soviet Union is to just make sure that communism can not spread. That it gets contained. We have the domino theory in the United States that if one country falls to communism in a region, that the rest of the countries will eventually fall. And that is not good for containment."
Social Studies,"So we did not want South Vietnam to fall. We essentially start supporting these characters over here. And even from the early '50s, the United States starts supporting the anti-communist. And at first, this support, it's in the-- I guess we should say-- the guise of advisers. But these advisers-- one, we start sending more and more aid, and more and more advisers. And these advisers started getting more and more involved in the actual conflict."
Social Studies,"And so after this partition, you can imagine, that you still have an ongoing conflict between the North and the South. And on top of that, you have actors who are sympathetic to the North, sympathetic to the Viet Minh, sympathetic to Ho Chi Minh, in the South. Some of them were in the North, they come back to the South. Some of them were just in the South. And they did not like the Diem government."
Social Studies,"Besides just being sympathetic to Ho Chi Minh, Diem was a fairly corrupt autocratic ruler, who wasn't a big fan of democracy. And so these players in the South who started to rise up against President Diem or the Viet And so this really sets up what the Vietnam War is all about. You have the communist Ho Chi Minh-controlled North that was fighting a conventional war against the South. You have this partition on the 17th parallel."
Social Studies,"And on top of that, you have an unconventional fighting force-- I guess you'd call them guerrillas-- in the South of Vietnam called the Viet Cong. So it was, kind of, a double-- There were two things that the South had to fight against-- the North officially, and also this insurrection that was occurring within the South. And so the whole time the United States did not want this insurrection to succeed-- they did not want all of Vietnam to become communist. We keep sending more and more advisers."
Social Studies,"It actually started even before Kennedy, but Kennedy he starts sending-- he escalates the number of advisers that gets sent. It's still not, at this point, it's still not a formal war. We haven't officially declared-- where we don't have, officially, soldiers in battle. You fast forward to 1963, besides all of the great characteristics of Diem that I already mentioned, he also was into persecuting Buddhists."
Social Studies,"So to make matters worse, not only was he corrupt, not only did he not like elections, but he liked persecuting his own people. And by 1963, this kind of got out of hand, his level of persecution of the Buddhists. He started toward storming temples, and all the rest. And so he was assassinated. And not only was he assassinated, it kind of leaves this power vacuum, and you have all these people jockeying for control, none of these really especially savory characters inside the South."
Social Studies,"These two guys eventually come to power, Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu. Wait a few years, Nguyen Van Thieu is able to get this guy out of the picture. And then by 1967-- I don't have it over here-- you have Thieu has now taken control. But during that period-- or actually, before Ky and Thieu take power-- in 1964, you have one of the shadiest incidents in American history."
Social Studies,"As you can imagine, we, in our function as advisors, we had sent ships into the Gulf of Tonkin, right off of the coast of North Vietnam. So the original story goes-- and this is a very suspect original story-- in 1964, the US Maddox-- and this is the original story-- claimed to that it was attacked, or it was claimed that the US Maddox was attacked by North Vietnamese patrol boats, and that there was a little skirmish-- there was an exchange of fire."
Social Studies,"And it was also claimed that a few days later another boat in the Gulf of Tonkin, another US vessel, was attacked by a North Vietnamese boat. That was the original story. This angered Congress, this angered the American people. How dare they attack ships that are sitting off of the coast, warships that are sitting off the coast. And so this kind of gave the emotional fuel to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution."
Social Studies,"So these incidents, or these purported incidents-- this, kind of, attack on the USS Maddox, and this other thing that might have happened-- these were called the Gulf of Tonkin Incidents. This angered Congress, angered the American people, so we passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, and what's relevant about it is that it gave LBJ, here, it gave him the authority to officially engage in a war in Vietnam, to officially escalate it to an actual war that the US was involved in."
Social Studies,"And this whole time I've been saying it's shady, because it's now been shown that one, the Gulf of Tonkin-- well it's not clear that really anything happened. There might have been some firing from the USS Maddox. They might have actually engaged the North Vietnamese patrol boats. The other possibility that might have happened is that nothing happened. But any way you look at it, it's now been fairly established that it was not a real incident. It was not really North Vietnam attacking the United States."
Social Studies,"But it was relevant because it really escalated the war. So now you have Johnson-- did I say North Korea originally? I apologize for that. We're talking about North Vietnam. I don't remember what my brain actually said. Of course, North Vietnam. But it gave Johnson the power to escalate the war. And so his administration is really the heart of the Vietnam War, when the war was really escalated. We eventually get to 500,000 US troops."
Social Studies,"But the whole time this is happening, you can imagine, Johnson and the American military leaders in Vietnam are telling the American people, oh, we're fighting communism. We're about to win. This is a noble war."
Social Studies,"And you fast forward, and especially, the part about to win-- you fast forward to 1968, and all of a sudden you have the Viet Cong, who the American leaders have told the American people and the Congress, that they're about to be defeated, and then in 1968, the Viet Cong orchestrate the Tet Offensive, which is this massive coordinated attack on a bunch of targets throughout South Vietnam."
Social Studies,"And so even though it was wasn't completely successful militarily, the intent of the Tet Offensive was to completely turn the tides in the war. It made the American people and the Congress rightfully suspicious. You, Mr. Johnson, you had told us that we were about to win the war, and the Viet Cong were almost defeated, and all of a sudden, they orchestrate this sophisticated attack on us. It rightfully made the American public suspicious."
Social Studies,"On top of that, and this probably made matters a lot worse, the My Lai Massacre comes out. And in every war there are massacres, but the United States, at least believes, that its soldiers can kind of take the high road. They don't engage in these type of things. But the My Lai Massacre showed that, really, no soldiers are immune to massacres. And this is really a disgusting massacre, and it was documented. And if you really want to be disturbed, do a Google search for images of the My Lai Massacre."
Social Studies,"It will ruin your weekend. It'll depress you. It's US soldiers killing a village of innocent women and children. There's pictures of dead babies. It's horrible, and to make matters worse-- or even, add insult to injury-- the soldiers who committed it-- there was actually a few who tried to defend the villagers and when they came back, they were treated almost like traitors."
Social Studies,"But the soldiers who actually did the attack, only one of them got jail time and it was only a couple years of jail time, and this was for massacring a village of women and children. So already, you had the Tet Offensive. It makes the American public suspicious of whether we can even win this war."
Social Studies,"Then you have the My Lai Massacre, which just disgusts the public, and makes people realize that we're involved in a war that it's not even clear who are the good guys anymore, not even clear what the real goals are. Make matters worse, you fast forward to 1971. The Pentagon Papers get leaked to the New York Times."
Social Studies,"And these pretty much articulate-- it's a classified document that articulates that the leadership, the military and non-military leadership of the Vietnam War, was, to some degree, lying to Congress and the American people. It was lying about how the war was going. It was lying about what activities it was doing. It did not tell the American people and Congress that it was actually engaged in war in Laos and Cambodia."
Social Studies,"And a lot of the reason why we were engaged in Laos and Cambodia is because that's where the supply routes were between the North and the South-- they ran through Laos and Cambodia. And the most famous of them, and you might have heard of it, is the Ho Chi Minh trail. And it wasn't just one trail, it was actually a network of trails. And so a lot of the activity that was going on in Laos and Cambodia was, kind of, carpet bombing of what the US thought were some of these supply routes."
Social Studies,"And we never really got a good-- well, that's a whole other debate. But it wasn't just one trail the was easily bombed. It was all of these little foot paths and all of these other things, where arms were able to be transported from the North to the South. But the Pentagon Papers, rightfully, made the American people even more suspicious."
Social Studies,"And then now we're entering into Nixon's administration, and he was still doing the carpet bombing, still atrocities going on, but he, his whole goal was to kind of wind down the war, bring the troops out on a timetable without, kind of, an unofficial defeat. So you fast forward to 1973, you have the Paris Peace Accords, where officially there is peace between the North, the South, the North, and the Americans."
Social Studies,"You can imagine it from the North's point of view, they're like, sure, we'll sign some peace accords. It'll just make the Americans go away, once the Americans go away they won't be able to come back, since this was such a hugely unpopular war. It was such a waste for America on so many dimensions. Especially, America's prestige as a global actor. We'll just wait for them to leave, and then we can overrun the South after that. And that's essentially what happens."
Social Studies,"In 1975, the North just overruns the South, and then later that year, you have Saigon falling to the North. And then it becomes Ho Chi Minh City. And just this whole period, you have President Thieu is in power, and just to show where his priorities are-- near the end, right when the North is falling to South Vietnam-- and you can kind of see the writing on the wall-- he gives a speech to the Vietnamese people saying that he'll never desert them."
Social Studies,"But then when it becomes pretty clear that Saigon is going to fall to the North Vietnamese, he gets on a big US transport plane with, literally, 15 tons of luggage. I'll let you think about how much luggage that is. And $15 million worth of gold, and this is $15 million worth of gold in 1975. So you can imagine how much he really cared about the Vietnamese people. And he eventually ends up settling in Massachusetts. And he died there about 10 years ago."
Social Studies,"So you could imagine, this was an ugly incident for the world. A super ugly incident for the Vietnamese people. A super ugly chapter in American history. It was the first war that one, America lost, but more, it hurts prestige, it hurts America's ability to influence what was going on in other parts of the world. You had the containment theory, that we have to stop communism from spreading. And the domino theory, that if one country would fall to communism then the other ones were. That didn't happen."
Social Studies,"The South did fall, but we didn't have the rest of Southeast Asia falling to communism. So it kind of disproved the domino theory, especially because after the Vietnam War the United States would not be able to enter another war like it for some time, because the American people wouldn't let it happen. So to some degree, it would have been easier for communism to spread, because people would have known that the US couldn't engage it. But despite that, the domino theory didn't happen."
Social Studies,"But it was just all-around ugly. I mean, besides the massacres, and the raping, and the pillaging of innocence that happened on, really, on all sides of this, you have 1 to 3 million Vietnamese-- and no one will really know the actual count-- but that's a huge number. 1 to 3 million Vietnamese were killed. You have 58,000 American troops being killed. And you have hundreds of thousands of Cambodians and Laotions who are never really formally involved in the war, they were killed."
Social Studies,"Especially, due to a lot of this carpet bombing campaign. So these are just atrocious numbers, and really one of the worst and ugliest chapters in US history.."
Social Studies,"But you should be skeptical and frankly you should be skeptical of anything anyone is telling you. I encourage y'all to kind of use this as a scaffold for your own research, for you to look up these names and these events and figure out what actually happened. Now, with that said, let's rewind back to 1970 when Chile was having an election for president."
Social Studies,"And they have their election and it's considered a fairly free and fair election, and one of the candidates in that election was this gentleman over here, Salvadore Allende, who was a known Marxist. A known Marxist. He has communist ideologies here. He's known to be sympathetic to what has happened in Cuba, sympathetic to the Soviets. So you can imagine in this context America is concerned. It's in the middle of the cold war. You have Richard Nixon President."
Social Studies,"You have Henry Kissinger is his Secretary of State. They're actively watching this election. They clearly do not want Salvadore Allende to become president. All of a sudden a major country in Latin America being controlled by a Marxist. Unlucky for them, Salvadore Allende actually does get more votes than everyone else. He gets 36% of the votes, which is a plurality."
Social Studies,"Just so you know what plurality means, it means that you got more of the votes than anyone else but not necessarily the majority of the votes. If he'd gotten 51% of the votes that would be a majority. In this case, he didn't get a majority and the standard procedure in Chile is that if no one gets a majority it goes to Congress and Congress picks who's president. The usual thing that they would do is they would pick whoever has the largest amount of votes. They normally didn't do a runoff."
Social Studies,"So, you can imagine Nixon and Kissinger they're worried. So they kind of get into let's mess with what's going on in Chile mode. And this part is well established that they had this what they called a track one strategy of actually trying to get the Chilean congress to not do what they normally do, to not pick the guy with the largest number of votes. So, they were trying to mess there, didn't seem like something they would be able to pull off."
Social Studies,"The other thing that it looks like they started to kind of get involved with through the CIA is they started to at least interface, it's not clear how much they actually supported, they actually started to talk to people in the military and see how likely is a coup to happen. How likely is Allende to be overthrown if he becomes president? They were looking for people who could I guess keep this known Marxist from becoming president."
Social Studies,"And the number one problem was this guy right over here, the number one problem was this guy right over here. In this whole video I would say that Rene Schneider was the only unambiguously good guy in this video. He was the commander in chief of the Chilean military. He said, ""Look, I don't care who becomes president. I don't care how much I disagree with him."
Social Studies,"I don't care how much pressure the Americans put on me or how much pressure the rest of the military puts on me, the role of the Chilean military is not to mess with politics."" The called him the constitutionalist. ""The role of the Chilean military is not to overthrow people when we don't like them. The role of the Chilean military is only to defend Chile. It's only to literally do ..."" I guess you know what militaries are supposed to do what constitutions say the military is supposed to do."
Social Studies,"So, you can imagine that the people who wanted to overthrow Allende, now that it looks like he's coming to power. They said this guy is not a convenient guy to have in power. He doesn't like to play the way we play, even though maybe there were other elements in the military that did want to do that. So, this is what's a little bit unclear."
Social Studies,"You have this former general in the Chilean military who is clearly anti Allende, and he's also anti Schneider because this guy right here Roberto Viaux, he thinks that the military should be I guess actively overthrowing dictators and so there is some contact between him and the CIA. It seems like the CIA may have supplied some support to him and then maybe got a little bit freaked out that ... At least Kissinger might have gotten a little bit freaked out that this guy seemed a little bit extreme."
Social Studies,"But remember we're in this period where Allende was, he got 36% of the votes, Congress is trying to figure out what they do about it and during this period there are some people who say Well look, if Rene Schneider is not going to do, what's in their mind, the right thing and depose the eventual Allende then we'll have to depose Rene Schneider. So, you have this plot that's worked up by Roberto Viaux to essentially kidnap Rene Schneider."
Social Studies,"And that would essentially depose him from being head of the military and maybe they could put somebody in his place who is more likely to have a coup, more likely to want to overthrow Allende. Unfortunately, when this guy's people tried to kidnap Schneider, Schneider he's got a gun, he sees these guys kidnapping, he takes out the gun and then the kidnappers shoot him several times and he eventually dies."
Social Studies,"So, this kidnapping turns into an assasination of Rene Schneider and they wanted to kill him or remove him or whatever just because he essentially wanted to do his job. So he's the only person in this whole narrative where I'll say he was an unambiguous good guy. Now, what's not clear is how much involvement the Americans or the CIA had in supporting this kind of assassination or this kidnapping of Scheider. It does look like they kind of knew that something was going on. This is a quote from Kissinger."
Social Studies,"Seems pretty well substantiated. Where he told Nixon a few days before Schneider was assassinated when Nixon said hey what's going on in Chile? Are we working on any ways through the military and are we doing anything about potentially maybe about Schneider. I don't know look that up for yourself. I don't know how much Nixon may or may not have known. Kissinger told Nixon, ""This looks hopeless. I turned it off."
Social Studies,"Nothing could be worse than an aborted coup."" So this quote is interesting because it looks like they thought about it. I turned it off. Which implies that at one point he had it turned on. So at one point they were actively thinking about working with Roberto Viaux maybe to kidnap Schneider, maybe to orchestrate a coup against Allende, but they turned it off. So, they're not morally above doing this kind of thing, but they decided that this guy was a little bit ..."
Social Studies,"Was not as competent as maybe they thought he should, and at least according to Kissinger he's saying we turned it off because nothing could be worse than an abortive coup. It turned out that's exactly what happened because as soon as this guy got killed everyone was like oh my God you have all these shady elements who are trying to overthrow democracy and that actually put more pressure on Congress to say hey we have to let Allende become president. So, in November he gets inaugurated president."
Social Studies,November Allende becomes president. There's a bunch of different stories here how much the CIA was involved. The counter argument is look the CIA would not have wanted to assassinate Schneider because this would have only made Allende all the more popular. They would have only maybe wanted to remove him and put someone else there who was more likely to have a coup against Allende later. Who knows.
Social Studies,"If you believe Kissinger's words here it looks like maybe they provided some initial support to Viaux and then they backed off a little bit. Who knows. Well, regardless to say by November of 1970 Salvadore Allende became president, and he started implementing his kind of Marxist ideology and it didn't go that well. Chile's economy especially if you fast forward to 1972, 1973, not doing so well. He started price-fixing."
Social Studies,"He tried to do the fairly naive approach of raising salaries while keeping prices fixed, which will obviously lead to shortages. So, all around he wasn't the most popular president. It didn't look like it, especially his economic policies wereworking out that well. People who were pro Allende would say well look just like what the United States did to Cuba they started doing to Chile as soon as they had a Marxist in charge, someone they didn't like."
Social Studies,"The United States started swinging its huge economic power around to kind of hurt the Chilean economy so that this guy would come out of power. I'll let you decide that. You fastforward all the way to 1973 so now Allende has been in power for about three years, things are not going well for him. There are strikes going on. He tries to clamp down on the media a bit. There is unrest."
Social Studies,"There are people who definitely don't want him to be president anymore, and the people who don't think much of the United States will say hey but the United States the whole time was kind of actively undermining Allende and that's probably true. The United States will say no look we were trying to keep the press free. This guy was clamping down on free press."
Social Studies,"We were trying to keep things so that there will be another election so that this guy won't turn into another Fidel Castro and essentially just turn Chile into a totalitarian communist regime. Regardless of which side you take, on September 11, 1973, Allende is deposed. The military surrounds the presidential palace and it is said that he commits ""suicide."" I put that in quotes because once again some people believe that he really did commit suicide."
Social Studies,"Some people believe that he was assassinated, and some accounts say that he committed suicide with an automatic weapon and well I guess you could commit suicide with an automatic weapon but it doesn't seem like the weapon of choice for many peoples, but I'll leave that once again for you to decide. Whether or not he committed suicide or whether he was killed, but regardless to say September 11 he gets thrown out of power and once again it's not clear what role the CIA played."
Social Studies,"They clearly were sympathetic to the people that wanted to overthrow him. Clearly were providing indirect support throughout Allende's regime to all of the people who were anti Allende, and you can look up. There actually are some declassified documents that hint at what the level of CIA involvement might have been. Regardless to say, Allende deposed and this gentleman, this gentleman comes to power right over here, Augusto Pinochet."
Social Studies,And he comes to power and he says look you know this democracy thing is silly. I am the president. I am the commander in chief. Chile will be run by military junta. Let me write that down. Chile will be run by a junta. A junta just means a government that's run by the military. It's a military dictatorship. The military is now in charge of Chile. We don't need people to do silly things like voting anymore. And you can imagine Nixon didn't care so much that this guy didn't like democracy but he was happy.
Social Studies,"Let me see if I can put a smile on his face. He was happy that at least Pinochet was not a Marxist, that at least we had stopped the spread of communism in Latin America. And Nixon, with that said, and this is explicit, he wanted everything in his power to make Augusto Pinochet successful especially from an economic point of view. So, the United States does start supporting Pinochet. He's viewed as kind of an American friend."
Social Studies,"Unfortunately for America and unfortunately for Chile, this guy is one of those big time tyrants in history. So, he is a tyrant. He starts rounding up people. He starts killing people. He's one of those people that anything anyone...there was a whiff of communism, a whiff of political opposition he would round them up, he would round their family up. He would torture people, and just to kind of put some ... This is another picture of him when he's older."
Social Studies,"It's amazing how gentle some fairly evil people can look in the world. So I'll put some unambiguous horns on him. He killed many, many people and many, many people disappeared. Just to give an idea, these are some of the people who disappeared. It was anyone from people who were critical of him, people who were perceived to be left-leaning, whatever it was. He tortured including women and children and all the rest. So, all around bad guy. He stuck around in Chile as president until 1990."
Social Studies,"So, that's 17 years, and he really stayed in power until 1998 where he was commander and chief of the army. You can imagine if the military is in control President isn't that important of a title. Commander and chief is. So for 25 years he hung around Chile and continued to be this totalitarian guy, although he liked free markets."
Social Studies,"He was a capitalist in the traditional sense and the one I guess silver lining if you had to throw a silver lining on Pinochet's regime was that the Chilean economy actually did well during his regime. Chile is considered one of the success stories economically over that time period. So, I'll let you decide, and some people would say oh that's because Pinochet understood economics, he didn't try to do all this price fixing stuff that Allende tried to do."
Social Studies,"Regardless of the fact that he was a tyrant, at least the economy was doing well. The other side of the equation would be well look of course the economy did well, now you had the United States doing everything in its power, this huge the largest economy in the world, doing everything in its power to make sure that Chile's economy thrives while one of its buddies are in power."
Social Studies,"So, I'll let you decide who's right, who's wrong, what was the actual involvement of the CIA and Nixon and Kissinger and all of this mess over here. But I think needless to say that this was a not so pleasant chapter in I guess world history.."
Social Studies,"Who knows what might have gone on behind scenes that never got documented by the historians. So you have to take everything with a grain of salt. And even in this video, I'll talk about, maybe, some patterns, or some themes, that I've seen, don't take that as just the truth. Think about it for yourself, if it makes sense, it makes sense. If it doesn't, try to look into it more, and try to come up with your own themes, or your patterns, or things that you can learn from."
Social Studies,"So the general pattern across all of these, is that before the US got involved, and before a communist-leaning regime got involved, these were all, in some ways, subjugated populations. In Korea, it was subjugated by the Japanese. It was a Japanese colony. In Cuba, it was subjugated by the Batista government. And this was a dictatorship, a corrupt dictatorship, and it was heavily influenced by the United States."
Social Studies,"You could almost view it as United States influence, a United States colony, they had so much influence with Batista. And in the case of Vietnam, it was a French colony. So you can imagine, in all of these situations the existing rulers were not that popular. People were looking for rulers who could liberate them from the messes they were in inside of that."
Social Studies,"On top of that-- and this comes to the whole discussion of capitalism versus communism-- you can imagine that when you are colonized, or when you are in a corrupt regime, you do have people accruing wealth. So there are people accruing wealth, some of whom will get it without being that legitimate. And so these circles are the size of different people's wealth."
Social Studies,"So you can imagine, in Korea under Japanese rule, maybe there were a few people who were successful by being legitimate entrepreneurs, but there were probably a whole bunch of people who were successful by just, kind of, sucking up to the colonial powers, in the case of a corrupt regime, doing things that were corrupt with the regime, using the regime it to get undue power in a certain market, and it's always a combination."
Social Studies,"In any of these countries, there were probably some entrepreneurs and some other people who got wealth, maybe, with good means, and then some other people, who under these regimes got wealth under questionable means, maybe because they sucked up to the corrupt regime. Or maybe, they even did outright criminal activity, which was probably the case in the Batista regime. You probably did have people who were just outright criminals doing very well for themselves. Same thing in Vietnam."
Social Studies,"Some of the Vietnamese who really were aligned with the French, probably got extra favors, and so their wealth wasn't necessarily due to innovation or competence, but really just where they fit into the political order. Maybe some other people did have legitimate wealth. So you imagine, when any of these type of situations start to emerge from subjugation-- so you start having independence movements in all of these situations."
Social Studies,"You could imagine it's a very popular notion to run on, and depending on how true it is. But it's a very popular notion to run on, to tell people, look, you've seen all of these people who've gotten questionable wealth, and maybe, some of these people who got questionable wealth got it by being aligned with our subjugators, by being, to some degree, traitors to our people."
Social Studies,"And once again, maybe not all the people, but you could see how it's a popular line for someone coming to power when you're emerging from independent-- or emerging into independence-- to say, why don't we redistribute wealth? Why don't we take the wealth from this person right here, who got it in questionable means, and redistribute it to the rest of the society? Why don't we take it from this person over here and redistribute it to the rest of society? Why don't we do that with this person here and redistribute that wealth to the rest of society? And if you're looking for a political ideology that seems to fit with this idea of trying to correct things that maybe looked wrong during the colonial or the subjugated rule, communism seems to fit that."
Social Studies,"It's kind of a redistributing of wealth, or maybe the state takes over all wealth, or maybe it's something in between where it's socialist, where the state is redistributing wealth fairly aggressively, but you still have, kind of, the underpinnings of capitalism."
Social Studies,"And so you could imagine that communism-- especially to a population where you have many, many, many poor people, the wealth concentrated in a few people, many of them who are aligned with the old regimes-- communism at least seems like a popular notion. And you have people who ride this nationalistic communistic feeling. In the case of Cuba, you have people like Fidel Castro. In Vietnam you have people like Ho Chi Minh."
Social Studies,"And then Korea is a little bit different, because you did have a communist nationalist independence movement, but Kim Il-Sung wasn't necessarily the leader of that movement. The Soviets actually didn't want any of those people in charge, any of the nationalist communists, the leaders of those movements. They kind of marginalized them, and installed Kim Il-Sung probably because he was more aligned with them, but he was communist."
Social Studies,"Now the reality is, these guys come in under these very egalitarian, equality for all, let's get retribution for the wrongs that were done to us before, but probably all of them start to not just redistribute wealth from people who might have gotten it in bad ways, but they're also just redistributing wealth generally, maybe because it's just a popular thing to do, or maybe because these people didn't give them proper support."
Social Studies,"So they're getting retribution on their political enemies, as opposed to just kind of doing it for social good. So they might do it from people who have legitimate wealth, and so those people aren't too happy about it. And they ride this kind of communist egalitarian movement to install themselves."
Social Studies,"And instead of just being a purely Marxist state, they want to be more Marxist-Leninist, where you have this Communist Party that has this continuous revolution, which is a justification for them to never hold real elections and always stay in power. So by no means is this a rationale why these people are legitimate. But what happened in every one of these cases is that the United States was in the middle of the Cold War, they feared the spread of communism."
Social Studies,"Communism tended to correlate with a non-free state. It doesn't have to be that way, but every time communism was implemented, it also was these kind of authoritarian rule, no democracy. And you could also imagine, there were many capitalists in the United States, who for their own selfish reasons, were afraid of capitalism spreading to the United States, because maybe their wealth would be redistributed."
Social Studies,"But regardless of what the justification, whether it was a more noble wanting people to have freedom of expression, freedom to own property, or whether it was the more selfish, that hey, we don't want our own wealth to be somehow taken away, or it just might have been a balance of power between the US and the Soviet Union, that every time a country fell to communism it's somehow the US losing some power in the world."
Social Studies,"Regardless of the US's rationale, they always say, OK, these guys are communist, we're going to take the other side of the equation. So the US ends up supporting Syngman Rhee in South Korea, who we know was not the best character in the world. They end up supporting Diem in South Vietnam, who we also know was not necessarily the most savory person in the world."
Social Studies,"In the case of Cuba, the US, at least-- they did support Batista while he was in power, but we saw in that video that Kennedy later came out and said, you know Batista was a pretty bad dude, and it was probably a big mistake for the US to support him. But the US goes on the other side, and they support the exiles against Fidel Castro. And here, the Cuban exiles they're not-- they are definitely not in the category of Syngman Rhee or Diem, and they probably favor democracy, and overall, good people."
Social Studies,"But what they probably did feed Kennedy is a story that Fidel Castro wasn't as popular as he actually was. And he probably was more popular especially after the revolution, because he had this egalitarian-- people were getting over Batista, anybody but Batista they would be happy about. Fidel Castro was this charismatic leader who was kind of working for the poor, at least it looked like he was working for the poor."
Social Studies,"So at least in the get go, especially the Kennedy administration might have been fed an overly optimistic view that got them involved in the Bay of Pigs Invasion and all of that. But this is just the general pattern that happened every time. And every time, it ended up in either a US defeat or a stalemate. Take whatever lessons there are from this, but it is a kind of an interesting pattern that had happened multiple times, pretty much every engagement that we had during the Cold War.."
Social Studies,"The term pogrom is a Russian word meaning these violent riots or attacks on people for their ethnicity. There were several through the 19th century. But they go back even before that word was coined as early as the first crusades. Famously in the Rhineland, many of the Jewish people were killed and attacked. You had a solid thread of antisemitism throughout much of Europe, including Germany and Eastern Europe as we get up to and through World War I."
Social Studies,"As we've talked about in other videos, the central powers lose World War I and the Treaty of Versailles places a lot of the blame on Germany. The national pride of Germany has been shattered. They have lost this war. They have lost territory. Their economy is in shambles. They're paying reparations. It is in that context that the National Socialist Party forms officially in 1920, coming out of the German Workers Party."
Social Studies,"They focused on ideas of national identity and from the start were against ethnic groups, blaming their problems, including the loss of World War I often on these ethnic groups. In 1921, Hitler, who had fought during World War I and based on some of his writings seemed to have found a lot of meaning during the war, he becomes the National Socialist Party leader. National Socialist, it gets abbreviated as Nazi, National Socialist Party, Nazi Party."
Social Studies,"In 1923, Hitler tries to begin an overthrow of the government. But his putsch, his coup, is unsuccessful and he is imprisoned. It is while in prison that he writes down his belief system that eventually gets published upon his release in 1925 under the title Mein Kampf, which can be translated as my struggle or my battle. This is just an excerpt from Mein Kampf."
Social Studies,"""If we pass all the causes of the German collapse in review, ""the ultimate and most decisive remains the failure ""to recognize the racial problem ""and especially the Jewish menace. ""The defeats on the battlefield in August, 1918,"" so he's referring the end of World War I, ""Would have been child's play to bear. ""They stood in no proportion to the victories ""of our people. ""It was not they that caused our downfall, no."
Social Studies,"""It was brought about by that power which prepared ""these defeats by systematically, over many decades, ""robbing our people of the political and moral instincts ""and forces which alone make nations capable ""and hence worthy of existence."" He's blaming Germany's defeat in World War I on a relatively small ethnic group. So, as you can see, a very twisted mind, very twisted thinking."
Social Studies,"""The lost purity of the blood alone ""destroys inner happiness forever,"" so he's very caught up with these ideas of purity, ""Plunges man into the abyss for all time, ""and the consequences can never more be eliminated ""from body and spirit."" Over time, what starts off as this fringe leader of a fringe party, as we go into the 20s and as the German economy gets even worse and there's hyperinflation, more and more people start to throw their support behind these extremists."
Social Studies,"And as we go into the 30s, the National Socialist Party is actually able to get reasonable representation in the German parliament. In 1933, the president of Germany appoints Hitler to be chancellor, which is the equivalent of being prime minister despite the Nazis not having a majority in parliament. This is the official beginning of what the Nazis will call the Third Reich. Reich translates as realm. They considered the First Reich to be the holy Roman Empire."
Social Studies,"They refer to the Second Reich as the German Empire after the holy Roman Empire up and through World War I. They don't consider the Weimar Republic, which they hate, the Third Reich. They consider that the interim Reich. And they consider themselves the Third Reich, the heir to the German Empire and the holy Roman Empire. Once Hitler and the Nazis get power, they really get a strangle hold on it. They start persecuting their political opponents both, outside the party, and inside the party."
Social Studies,"They also start to take action on these twisted ideas Hitler expressed in Mein Kampf. In 1935, they're able to pass the Nuremberg Laws, which strips German Jews of their citizenship. It forbids intermarrying between non-Jewish Germans and Jews. This is only one of many steps that will continue to demean the rights of Jews inside of Germany. In 1938, you have what is known as Kristallnacht, or the night of broken glass. Hundred of synagogues are burned."
Social Studies,"Thousands of Jewish businesses are destroyed and many Jews are killed in that night. Then as we get into 1939, Hitlers' armies famously invade Poland beginning what many historians consider to be the start of World War II. What would eventually be known as the Holocaust goes into full effect in 1941. Jews are sometimes executed in the streets, in their homes, many of them are captured and sent to concentration camps."
Social Studies,"To get a sense of the scale of this operation, we have this excerpt from Michael Berenbaum's book, The World Must Know. ""The policy of extermination involved every level ""of German society and marshaled the entire apparatus ""of the German bureaucracy. ""Parish churches and the Interior Ministry supplied ""the birth records that defined and isolated Jews. ""The post office delivered the notifications ""of definition, expropriation, denaturalization, ""and deportation."
Social Studies,"""The Finance Ministry confiscated Jewish wealth ""and property. ""German industrial and commercial firms ""fired Jewish workers, officers, and board members, ""even disenfranchising Jewish stockholders. ""The universities refused to admit Jewish students, ""denied degrees to those already enrolled, ""and dismissed Jewish faculty."
Social Studies,"""government transportation bureaus handled ""the billing arrangements with the railroads ""for the trains that carried Jews to their death."" The point that's being made here is this could not be done just with Hitler and some of his close associates. To kill millions of people on this scale, you needed and entire apparatus. And hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people were involved in some way. At least several hundreds of thousands of people within Germany must have been aware of what was happening."
Social Studies,"Needless to say, the death toll was considerable. This here is a visual depiction of the percentage of the Jewish population that was killed in various regions. As you can see, 80 to 90 percent of the Jewish population in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, was killed during the Holocaust. In the territories occupied by Germany in Russia during World War II, almost as many had been killed. In France, Italy, 1/5 to 1/4 of the population was killed."
Social Studies,"To put things more in human terms, this is a picture of children who were in Auschwitz, one of the most infamous concentration camps. You can see their names, their ages, and then when they were killed. Historians believe five to six million Jews were killed during the Holocaust including a million and a half children. This was 2/3 of the Jewish population of Europe. But the Holocaust went further. It's believed that over 10 million civilians were killed during the Holocaust."
Social Studies,"Over three million prisoners of war were killed. And other people including several hundred thousand Romani, often referred to as Gypsies. Several hundred thousand people with disabilities, many thousands of homosexuals were all put to death during the Holocaust. We've covered a lot of world history. A lot of it, unfortunately, has a lot of death, a lot of destruction and sometimes targeting people for their ethnicity. But never, in world history, have we seen something at this scale."
Social Studies,"Because it seemed to be a relatively new concept, a term was coined, genocide. It was coined by Raphael Lemkin who, as a Holocaust survivor, had 49 members of his family killed during the Holocaust. It means killing of a people. Geno, coming from a people or a family, and cide, killing. But maybe even more interesting than the word definition itself, is thinking about why this actually happened. Maybe even more importantly, how society can avoid it. I'll leave you with that question."
Social Studies,What do you think was the reason why this happened? And do you think we have a risk of that happening in the future? And how can we prevent it?.
Social Studies,"But despite that, the 20th century is one of the bloodiest centuries in human history. You have World War I, where roughly 17 million people die. In World War II, 50 to 80 million people die, some directly because of the conflict, but many because of lack of access to food and famine. The Chinese are particularly hit. Over 15 million died during the Japanese occupation of China."
Social Studies,"This idea of genocide comes about, first with the Armenian genocide in the declining Ottoman Empire where over a million people are believed to have been killed, and then in World War II, you have the holocaust, where six to 11 million people were killed, roughly two thirds of the Jewish population in Europe and many others. The Russian empire and eventually the Soviet Union gets especially hit hard in the first half of the 20th century. In World War I alone, three million Russians died."
Social Studies,"Shortly after the war, you have a significant Russian famine that killed five million people. Then in the early thirties, you have the Soviet famine, five to seven million people. This is believed to have occurred because of Stalin's attempts to make agriculture collectivized. In the late thirties, you have Stalin's purge, where he goes after political opponents, and it's believed that he killed as many as three million people."
Social Studies,"These things were so shocking to the planet that they made attempts to prevent them in the future. In 1920, out of the trauma of World War I, the League of Nations was founded. It was an attempt to prevent things like this in the future, for nations to talk to each other and to coordinate so they don't go to war, especially at the scale seen in World War I."
Social Studies,"But clearly, that was unsuccessful, and we have World War II where even more people die, after which the slightly stronger United Nations gets founded, once again with the charter of fostering dialog between nations so that we can prevent these types of trauma for the planet. Early on in the newly founded UN agenda was this idea of revisiting the ideas of The Enlightenment, this idea of human rights, and trying to codify them in international law."
Social Studies,"In 1948, you have the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that's drafted by the United Nations, and it was an attempt to make a universal declaration of these rights that all humans on the planet have access to. I'm going to give excerpts of it, and keep a lookout for things that feel awfully close to ideas in the United States Declaration of Independence, the US constitution, or ideas from The Enlightenment. This is part of the preamble."
Social Studies,"Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and unalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world. Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outrage the conscience of mankind. Remember World War II just happened."
Social Studies,"And the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people. Now, therefore, the general assembly proclaims this universal declaration of human rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. You might be thinking, ""Why did they even have to write this?"" Well, think about it."
Social Studies,"Things like the constitutions of various countries, especially the United States, these only applied to those countries, but now there was an attempt to write down, to codify something that would apply to all human beings, to the entire planet, and here's just some of the 30 articles to that declaration, to that Universal Declaration of Human Rights. All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."
Social Studies,"They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in the spirit of brotherhood. This really feels similar to some of the ideas of Locke in The Enlightenment that we talk about in other videos. Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political, or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status."
Social Studies,"So this is interesting, because even though I start this video with the United States Declaration of Independence and a discussion of the constitution, slavery in the United States would last for another 80 plus years after the Declaration of Independence was written. Women didn't even have the right to vote until the early 20th century, so beyond this being a universal declaration for the entire planet, the attempt is also to make it clear that it needs to apply to everyone."
Social Studies,"Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person. No one shall be held in slavery or servitude. No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Everyone charged with a penal offense has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. Once again, ideas that seemed very similar to what we see in constitutions like that of the United States. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion."
Social Studies,Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Very similar to the First Amendment in the US constitution. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. No one may be compelled to belong to an association. And article 21 is especially interesting. Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country directly or through freely chosen representatives. Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.
Social Studies,"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government. So this is a big statement. It's taking a stand, saying that everyone on the planet should be able to live in a democracy and participate in a democracy. The commission that drafted this declaration was chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of Franklin Roosevelt. This is a map of who voted for this declaration and these are the countries in green."
Social Studies,"Who abstained, they just decided not to vote for the declaration, those are the countries in orange, and then you have a few that voted against it. In gray are the countries that weren't part of the United Nations at the time. An interesting question looking at this map is to think about why certain countries were willing to vote for it and why other countries decided to abstain at the time."
Social Studies,"These articles are talking about people having the right to participate in a democracy, the right to be equal, that all people are equal, and in many of these countries, people did not have equal rights. You had severe discrimination in places like South Africa. In many of these countries, you did not have a democracy, but there's a broader question here."
Social Studies,"It's nice to be able to write these fairly idealistic ideas, but to what degree does it have an effect, and to what degree can it actually be enforced? You might cite things like the American Civil Rights Movement, which did echo some of these ideas that were made in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Maybe they helped the civil rights movement, or maybe the civil rights movement would've happened regardless of what the UN did. But at the same time, you have ideas like apartheid."
Social Studies,"You have racism and discrimination in South Africa from the beginning of colonial rule, but it was actually at the exact same time as this declaration that the official policy of apartheid, of government-sanctioned discrimination, of government-sanctioned segregation, preventing racial mingling came into effect and lasted all the way until 1991."
Social Studies,"And so one could make an argument, maybe things would've been worse without the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or maybe the Universal Declaration of Human Rights really wasn't in a situation to actually effect things like this. In many of the countries around the world, not just the orange ones but often in many of the green ones as well, you continued to see things that go against those ideas of universal human rights."
Social Studies,"Even if the UN passes something and if one country doesn't want to abide by it, what action can the other countries take? Economic action, maybe sanctions, maybe military action, and to what degree are people actually willing to do that?."
Social Studies,"Germany, Belgium, Italy also have imperial possessions."
Social Studies,"Now as we go through World War I, that changes the map of Europe fairly dramatically and we talk about that in other videos but some of the major outcomes, at least when we're talking about imperialism is that the Austro-Hungarian Empire gets broken up, changing the map of Eastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire gets broken up, with much of the Middle East now under control by the British or French and of course Russian exits World War I having had the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and is now the Soviet Union."
Social Studies,"As we get into the period after World War I, we start to see momentum gather in terms of independence movements, in terms of this imperial structure breaking down. In 1922, Egypt becomes independent of the United Kingdom. Iraq, which was part of the Ottoman Empire for centuries was put under British control after World War I and in 1932, it gets its independence. Then we enter into World War II, which is an incredibly traumatic time, not just for Europe but for the world."
Social Studies,"And as we exit out of World War II, we see further momentum being gained for the various anti-colonial independence movements. Indonesia, which was originally a Dutch colony but during World War II, gets under the control of Japan as part of its imperial possessions, but as we get into August of 1945, the Japanese are bombed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, effectively ending World War II and the Indonesians are able to claim their independence nominally now from the Dutch."
Social Studies,"Then from 1944 to 1946, further possessions that were originally part of the Ottoman Empire but after World War I became under the control of the French and British, Syria and Jordan, gain their independence. Syria from France and Jordan from United Kingdom. And then in 1947, you have the independence of the Indian subcontinent. This is a particularly noteworthy struggle under the leadership of Mohandas Gandhi, often known as Mahatma Gandhi, mahatma meaning great soul."
Social Studies,"And it's a peaceful resistance that's able to get independence. Now the subcontinent is partitioned into what will become Pakistan and India. For the most part, areas that were majority Muslim became Pakistan and you can see this region in the west, and this region in the east which would later get its independence in 1971 and become Bangladesh, and then for the most part, regions that had Hindu majorities became India."
Social Studies,"This wasn't a clean partition because there were some territories, princely states, areas where the majority was not clear that became under contention. Kashmir, even to this day, is a point of contention between India and Pakistan. Much of the Indian subcontinent was very mixed with some areas being 60% Hindu or 40% Muslim or vice versa so that catalyzed one of the largest migrations in human history, the number of people changing borders, sometimes becoming quite sectarian and quite bloody."
Social Studies,"But even after that, India is still one of the largest Muslim countries."
Social Studies,"The founder of Pakistan is Muhammad Ali Jinnah and India's first prime minister and both of them were active in the independence movement, is Jawaharlal Nehru, who will become famous for the non-aligned movement, for newly liberated countries to not want to side on either side of the Cold War and he actually coins the term third world which is now associated with developing countries, but when it was coined, it meant, we don't wanna be first world aligned with the western capitalist countries, we don't wanna be second world, aligned with the communist block, we wanna be independent or the third world."
Social Studies,"As we get into the late '40s and early '50s, we also see an independence movement in French Indochina. These countries will eventually become North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and a significant figure here is Ho Chi Minh who will become a very prominent figure as the French Indochina War eventually evolves into the Vietnam War, bringing the United States into it as part of its Cold War containment strategy. The 1950s also see significant independence movements throughout Africa."
Social Studies,"In 1951, Libya gains independence. From 1956 to 1958, Tunisia, Morocco, Ghana, Guinea, all gain independence. Of particular note is Ghana, originally called Gold Coast. The first president and prime minister is Kwame Nkrumah and he's known as one of the founders of the Organization of African Unity and he wanted to see where a world where as these African countries became independent, they unified, seeing that Africa would have much more power as a unified entity than as a fragmented one."
Social Studies,"And so he was a major promoter of the idea of pan-Africanism. Now the independence movements only accelerated as we go into the 1960s. 1960 in particular was a year of many independence movements but you can see here, most of Africa was independent as we exit the 1960s. In blue here, listed the French colonies that gained independence in this time period. In this salmon color, the British colonies, and in yellow, the Belgian colonies."
Social Studies,"There would continue to be change over the next few decades but the world starts to look very similar to the world as we recognize it today. Now I'll leave you with a speech that Jawaharlal Nehru made in Washington DC in 1956, which highlights his desire for nonalignment. ""The preservation of peace forms the central aim ""of India's policy. ""It is in the pursuit of this policy that we have chosen ""the path of nonalignment in any military ""or like pact of alliance."
Social Studies,"""Nonalignment does not mean passivity of mind or action, ""lack of faith or conviction, it does not mean submission ""to what we consider evil. ""It is a positive and dynamic approach ""to such problems that confront us."
Social Studies,"""We believe that each country has not only the right ""to freedom but also to decide ""its own policy and way of life."" And this is a big deal because remember, he's giving this speech in Washington DC which would love him to clearly align with the western block, with the capitalist countries led by the United States but after working so hard for their independence, many of these nations, like India, were not eager to lose their autonomy and realign with more powerful countries."
Social Studies,"To close out this video, I'll leave you with an interesting question or a series of interesting questions."
Social Studies,"Why do we see a good chunk of the world become independent in the second half of the 20th century? Was it that the imperial countries no longer had the energy or the power or the will to control these colonies? Was it something happened in the psychology of their peoples, they just went through a traumatic war, and they realized that they weren't interested in controlling the destiny of other people? Was it due to the efficacy of some of these independence struggles, like the nonviolence movement led by Gandhi? Or maybe some of the more violent independence struggles like what we saw in Algeria against the French."
Social Studies,"But needless to say, the world fundamentally changed in this time period. When we were entering into the 20th century, we had an imperial world, especially controlled by the Western European powers. After two traumatic wars, imperialism comes to an end and we see the world as we know it today.."
Social Studies,"If you wanted to talk about when the pyramids were constructed, it would be right about there. You could hardly see the time difference between now and several thousand years ago. If you want to see how long we've had writing, about 5000 years is our current best estimate. Once again, it barely shows up on this timeline. How long have we had agriculture? Well, 10 to 15 thousand years. Once again, it's a small fraction of this."
Social Studies,"Another way to think about it, think about all of our ancestors, the various generations that have passed since the first appearance of anatomically modern human beings. This is over 6 or 7 thousand generations into the past. Think about all of the stories that must have happened. A lot of simple things. It might be a founding of a village, a killing of an animal, a very simple courtship, a tenderness between a mother and their child."
Social Studies,"And think about the big things, the wars, the battles, the natural disasters. It's hard for us to imagine how much has occurred even in the last hundred or two hundred or thousand years, much less 200,000 years. But we seek to understand regardless. And that is what history is all about. And as we'll see, history is in general trying to understand the stories of our past."
Social Studies,"And if we want to get a little bit more technical, we can also think about prehistory, which is, technically, the things that happened before we had writing. Because writing is our main tool for history. What I have right over here, this picture, this is Egyptian hieroglyphs. And Egyptian hieroglyphs are over 5000 years old. I could write 5000 years before the present."
Social Studies,"But even when you have writing, it's not enough as we'll see not only in this video, but in many videos as we study history and world history. It's really a lot of science and a lot of detective work to make sense of what has happened. And that understanding will constantly evolve. For example, we didn't know what these hieroglyphs said until 1799 when we found the Rosetta Stone."
Social Studies,"And what was useful about the Rosetta Stone is that they had some text written in the hieroglyphs and they had the same text then written in a Greek that we were able to understand and that started to help unlock what these hieroglyphs said. But even once you have a sense of what they say or even if you understand it quite well, you still have to do a lot of detective work and take everything with a grain of salt."
Social Studies,"You can imagine if there's a bunch of groups of people here and we get the history from this group, for some reason we were able to find what they wrote, well it might not be completely unbiased. They might have a negative view of this group or that group. And so you have to take it all with a grain of salt. At the extreme form, they might have eliminated some of these groups and then only they were around to say what actually happened."
Social Studies,"You also have to be skeptical because you don't know whether these stories are actual accounts or whether someone just made it up to fit a worldview. You also have to keep in mind that these stories, whether they were transmitted written or orally, they're oftentimes retransmitted from generation to generation, and especially in the oral case. But even in the written, you've gotta wonder what's added over each generation. You can imagine people embellishing, making the story a little bit better."
Social Studies,"Or taking out things of the story that really doesn't fit in with their worldview. So even when we have the writing, and this is once again, some images of early writing. This is the famous Sumerian cuneiform tablet here. Even when we have it, obviously, we have much much more writing as we get to the more recent past, we have to be very very very skeptical."
Social Studies,"We know, today, even if two observers observed something yesterday, something that just happened, they might have very very different perceptions of what happened. So even though there's writing, we have to be skeptical. But things get, in some ways, even more interesting before we have writing, when we go into prehistory. You might wonder how do we know anything about what happened if there's no written accounts? Well that's where the science and we get even more detective work."
Social Studies,"For example, this is a Neanderthal skull. And the type of people, the sciences that will study this, you'll hear terms like anthropologists. Anthropologists or anthropology. This is the study of present and past humans and human society. And then a subset of anthropology, which is really delving into prehistory and even history itself, is archaeology. Archaeology which is the subset of anthropology that focuses on the past study of humans and human society and they're mainly going to do it through remains."
Social Studies,"Now there's other fields, you might associate, the field of paleontologist. Paleontologist. Paleontology. You might associate this with things like dinosaur bones, but their techniques are also useful for old human remains or even pre-human remains. And so it might inform archaeology and anthropology. So for example, an archaeologist might unearth this Neanderthal skull."
Social Studies,"They will use some science in order to figure out: When did this skull enter into the ground? They might use a technique like radiocarbon dating. Radiocarbon dating, which could be used for things up to around 50,000 years old, so around that time span on our timeline. And it's based on this idea that you have this atmospheric carbon-14 that actually comes from nitrogen-14 that gets between interactions with the solar wind and these cosmic particles becomes this radioactive carbon-14."
Social Studies,"And the carbon-14 which can become part of carbon dioxide incorporate into plants through photosynthesis which then get eaten into animals. So while something is living, they'll have a certain amount of carbon-14 in their tissue. But then once they die, they're now no longer adding more carbon-14. And the carbon-14 decays into the more stable carbon-12."
Social Studies,"And so based on the ratio between the carbon-14 to the carbon-12, and it takes roughly 5,000 years, 5,730 years to be exact, for roughly half of the carbon-14 to decay into carbon-12. So based on this ratio, and I go into much more detail in other videos, you can figure out how old these things are and you get reasonably precise, within a couple of a hundred, hundreds of years."
Social Studies,"If you want to go further into the past, there's things like potassium-argon dating, which is once again taking a radioactive form of potassium and using the idea that it decays into argon. And that when a volcano releases the argon in that rock, is able to go into the atmosphere, but then once it hardens, you have the decay and so you can see how long since that volcanic eruption are we looking at. And so for example, you can dig, you can do stratographic techniques right over here."
Social Studies,"Stratigraphy, I have trouble saying these words. That's looking at the various layers of the earth. And you might use some dating techniques, for example potassium-argon. Say: ""Okay, this is that, a certain amount of age, ""that is a certain amount of age, ""this was volcanic rock from a volcanic eruption."" And then you can look at the fossils."
Social Studies,"You can say: ""Okay, a fossil that I found here"" ""is going to be newer than the stuff here"" ""and it's gonna be older than the stuff here"" ""and this might be the newest of all."" So you can look at relative dating and if you're lucky enough to have some volcanic rock, you could do some of this potassium-argon dating and there's many many many other techniques. And it isn't just about saying: ""Oh, this skull ""was in this place in the world at this time."" You can start to infer other things."
Social Studies,"You can look for fossils of the type of animals, the type of plants near these burial sites. You could see how dense these burial sites were, what type of cultures were there. You could start to make inferences. You can try to infer how these people died. You might have some trauma fractures here and you might say: ""Okay, that was a violent death."" You might look at their teeth to think about the type of things they might have eaten or their general health."
Social Studies,"You might look at the tools that are buried near them. This right over here, these are Paleolithic arrow, I guess, spearheads or tools right over here. Paleolithic is defined by more of these harder edges. You have Neolithic tools which have more of these smoother edges. Then Old Stone Age, New Stone Age right over here. And by looking at all of that, you have all of these scientists, you have these anthropologists, archaeologists, paleontologists, who are starting to piece together prehistory."
Social Studies,"And sometimes these techniques are done together. Sometimes we have writing and we have these technique to try to get a more complete picture. Now I want to end with just a note of caution. Even though we have all of these techniques, we're learning more everyday, our understanding of all that has happened is very very incomplete. And even more, it constantly gets challenged the more we learn. There are things that very serious people believed 50 or 100 years ago that we have now proven to be false."
Social Studies,"And things that we now take very seriously, it's likely that in 50 or 100 years people might prove some of that wrong. So history, even though it's about the past, it is constantly evolving. We're constantly learning more and we should have a very solid humility about what we know and what we don't know.."
Social Studies,"So by human standards this is a very long period of time. And I didn't choose this time span arbitrarily. 200,000 years is about how long we believe anatomically modern humans have been on our planet, our sub-species of Homo sapiens sapiens. Now the reason why I show these stone tools is because the ages, the periods, of modern humanity, or even pre-modern humanity, are named after the types of tools that have been found in archaeological digs."
Social Studies,"So most of even pre-human, or near pre-human, and human history, has been the Paleolithic period, or old stone age. Paleo, paleo for old, lithic coming from lithos for stone. So Paleolithic. The old stone age is the great bulk of human history. And there's also a Mesolithic that comes about 15,000, 20,000 years ago. But then around 10,000 years ago, the stones have a much more polished appearance to them. Things like this."
Social Studies,"And so that period from about 10,000 years, starting with about 10,000, 15,000 years, depending on what part of the world you look at, is referred to as the Neolithic period. Neolithic, referring to new stone. And on top of this timeline, I have also shown what's happening at a very large scale, climactically, on the Earth. So these blue periods are ice ages, and these reddish orange periods are the periods in between ice ages."
Social Studies,"And so you can see the last ice age ended roughly 15,000 years ago, and it began roughly 110,000 years ago. Now I'm giving you all this context about these Paleolithic, Neolithic, and the ice ages, because we're gonna talk about probably the most important series of events, or innovation, in all of human history. And that is agriculture. Agriculture."
Social Studies,"For most of human history, over this Paleolithic period, over most of this timeline going up until about 10,000 or 15,000 years ago, our ancestors were hunter gatherers. They would have to chase the game wherever it might be, they couldn't settle down in one place. Maybe there were a few that were near some sources of fish where they might be able to do some basic fishing. But they would have done hunting like this."
Social Studies,"They would have done gathering, which means getting berries or mushrooms where they could find it. It probably was eating a lot of things like insects, and that is most of human history. But then around 10,000 or 15,000 years ago, we have the advent of human beings taking nature into their own hands. Instead of saying, let's just follow the game wherever the game might migrate to, let's actually domesticate these animals."
Social Studies,"Let's take some of them, start breeding them so they're more suitable for human consumption, so that they are easier to raise, maybe more robust, and we will breed them, and we will raise them for milk, for meat. We also started to domesticate plants. Instead of saying, okay let's just gather those berries there where it happens to emerge, oh let's actually start to plant things. And on a very predictable way, be able to harvest them, and so be able to have a more predictable food supply."
Social Studies,"Both of these things allowed human beings to have a higher population density, to start to settle down, to have a more sedentary life. And this is a huge, huge, huge deal. Just to get a sense. We believe that the carrying capacity for the planet, for human beings as hunter gatherers, is 10 million people. And that is what we estimate the world population was around the time of the last ice age, or shortly afterwards."
Social Studies,"And that's because a tribe of 100 hunter gatherers is going to need 50 square kilometers to 100 square kilometers to hunt and gather from, or actually 500, from some of the estimates I've seen. And it might seem like a lot of area that you would need to hunt and gather from, but imagine that you and your family had to go live in the woods now."
Social Studies,"How much food could you actually find? You'd have to walk miles and miles per day, if you're trying to hunt, you'd have to walk miles and miles per day to get whatever wild grains or berries, or whatever, or mushrooms, or whatever, or insects, that you might consume. But then with the advent of agriculture it allowed for a much, much higher density population."
Social Studies,"In fact, going from the birth of agriculture, which happens in the Neolithic period, the dawn of agriculture coincides with the Neolithic period, they're often used somewhat interchangeably. Going from that period 10,000, 15,000 years ago, to the time of ancient Rome, so we're on the order of 10,000 years, the world population with agriculture exploded from 10 million to roughly 250 million. And that's 25x."
Social Studies,"And we know that from the time of Rome 'til now, another 2,000 years with agriculture, our population has gone up 28x, it's growing exponentially, to seven billion. And there's no way that we could have had this level of density without agriculture. Now a key question is, is why did agriculture emerge right then? Well one theory is is, well it seems to be only, and I'll say only in quotes, only a few thousand years after the end of the ice age."
Social Studies,"Maybe you had positive climate change, at least from a human point of view, that allowed land to support agriculture. That seems like a reasonable theory."
Social Studies,"Although you might say, well we've had other periods where we didn't have an ice age, how come we see no evidence of agriculture then? And one counterargument or explanation I've heard for that is, anatomically modern humans started to emerge around 200,000 years ago, but that doesn't mean that the way they thought, or that their brains were the same as modern humans. And so maybe in this period the human brain just wasn't capable of performing, or thinking of agriculture."
Social Studies,"Other theories are is that the human population through hunter gathering kept increasing over time, and it was right after the last ice age that you really got close to this critical mass of population, at which point, for every extra human to be born, another human would not be able to live, or not be able to be born, because there was a fixed supply of food as hunter gatherers."
Social Studies,"And so you could say out of necessity, maybe a tribe here or a little group there, started to say hey, well what if we started to domesticate some of this cattle? Or if we started to plant crops? All of a sudden they would start to have a higher density and their population could increase. And not only would they be able to survive, but they could also be very dominant in things like conflict."
Social Studies,"Once you start having agriculture, and as agriculture advances, as I mentioned, these people could be more sedentary. They wouldn't have to move around. They wouldn't have to move around all of the time. That allows them to create even defensive structures. You could have specialization, where not everyone is having to worry about, specialization, not everyone is having to worry about food all of the time."
Social Studies,"And so you could develop warriors, you could have technology developing, especially weapons, and so not only would that tribe or that group be able to get higher density, but they would be able to defend their property. In fact they would probably care a lot more about property, because they use it to farm, versus hunter gatherers might just view that as their territory that they wander over in order to find food."
Social Studies,"Now whatever the actual cause of the birth of agriculture, it has had profound implications on our society. You would not have had the birth of city-states, without agriculture. City-states had high density populations. They could not have been supported with hunter gathering. You could not have had the development of technology, which, people needed more time, you needed specialization, in order to have that."
Social Studies,"It's, I would say, fair to say, we wouldn't even have our modern, our modern civilization would not have been possible without agriculture. I would not be making this video to you right now. In fact most of us wouldn't even have been around on the planet because the planet wouldn't have been able to support our really immensely large population without not only agriculture, but an ever advancing, technologically advancing agriculture. So it might seem like a small thing."
Social Studies,"You go from hunter gatherer to agriculture, but it's been one of the most, maybe the most profound, well it's probably up there with language and writing, things that have defined what makes humans humans. And to get a sense of where this agriculture was born, here's the various regions that we believe agriculture emerged from."
Social Studies,"The Levant right over here in the eastern Mediterranean, modern day Middle East, Syria, Israel, Palestine, Iraq, southeastern Turkey, this is one of the areas where we think agriculture first emerged on the order of 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. We believe rice came from China. I've seen estimates anywhere from 6,000 to 13,000 years ago."
Social Studies,"You have the potato and other crops coming from the Andes thousands of years ago, and this is just a sample of the areas where we see agriculture, both domestication of crops and animals first emerging. And what's interesting is, over time we're likely to discover other places as we have more archaeological digs and we find more fossil evidence of ancient agriculture and ancient peoples."
Social Studies,"And even the time frame where we believe this happened, the 10,000, 12,000, 15,000 years ago, that's likely to maybe move back a little bit as we discover older and older evidence. So I'll leave you there, but the big takeaway is most of human history we were not only making rough stones for our weapons and our tools, but we were chasing animals wherever we could find 'em. We didn't have predictable food sources."
Social Studies,"We were gathering fruits and grains, and insects wherever we could to support our families, and there was a limit on how many humans could be around. But shortly after the end of the ice age, it all changed. You had a population explosion, and we think that is due to agriculture.."
Social Studies,"Later on, the rivers could be useful for transporting things like crops, and so it's not surprising that our first significant civilizations also emerged where the first agriculture emerged. And our first civilizations we'll see in ancient Egypt along the Nile. We will see it in the Indus Valley along the Indus River. We'll see it in China along the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, and we'll also see it in Mesopotamia along the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers."
Social Studies,"And what we're gonna focus on in this video in particular is Mesopotamia. Now, the word Mesopotamia literally come from meso, between, and potamos. I'm probably not pronouncing it right, rivers. So it's the area between rivers is literally what Mesopotamia is referring to. And it's primarily modern day Iraq."
Social Studies,"Now the reason why this is particularly interesting and it's called the cradle of civilization, is not only is it one of or perhaps the first place that agriculture developed, it was at the crossroads of many other early civilizations. Notice it's right in between the Indus Valley civilization here, and then the ancient Egyptians, and other civilizations that were emerging in the area."
Social Studies,"And so it's not surprising that this was a geography that had significant developments in terms of technology, in terms of architecture, in terms of religion, in terms of writing. And the first civilization we believe that emerged in Mesopotamia are the Sumerians. Sumerians. And Sumeria and Sumerians, it's most associated with this region right over here of, let me circle it, this region right over here of southern Mesopotamia."
Social Studies,"And we currently think that this civilization started to emerge around 4000 BCE. You can see it on this timeline here in orange, and they developed things as basic as the wheel. The first wheel that was ever discovered was 3500 BCE in Sumeria. They're famous for their architectural structures. This is a picture here of a ziggurat, which was at the center of many of these Sumerian and as we'll see Mesopotamian cities."
Social Studies,"This would require an incredible amount of labor to produce, and at the top of these they had temples to their Gods and their Gods, they had a polytheistic religion, and their Gods took human form. Also amongst the Sumerians is where we think one of the first written languages developed. It wasn't the first. You also have the Egyptian hieroglyphics and written language emerged amongst the Harappans and the Indus Valley civilization and amongst the Chinese, but it was one of the first languages."
Social Studies,"This right over here is an example of a cuneiform tablet. This is a cuneiform tablet written in the script. Cuneiform developed by these ancient Sumerians. Now, when you talk about Mesopotamia, you'll talk about Sumerians, but we'll also talk about other civilizations that emerge. In particular, let me write them all down. You have the Sumerians. You'll also hear something called Akkadian, and as we'll see, Akkadian is both a language and an empire that will emerge."
Social Studies,"In Mesopotamia over the roughly 3,000 years BCE, the two primary languages are Akkadian, which is considered a Semitic language. It's related to modern Semitic languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, and the reason why they're called Semitic is because they're spoken or they're reported to be spoken by the descendants of Shem, who was Noah's son, in the Hebrew bible. So, you have the language Akkadian, which is Semitic, and then you have the other language, which is Sumerian."
Social Studies,"And as we get into the third millennium BCE, the Sumerians start to have a lot of interaction with Akkadian speaking people, and Akkadian speaking people are initially associated primarily with northern Mesopotamia, and we believe the first empire, true empire, perhaps the first empire in the world emerged from Acadia, and it was called the Akkadian Empire. And if we scroll down over here, we can see how the Akkadian Empire spread."
Social Studies,"We believe that the town of Akkad, which the Akkadian Empire is named for, some place in this region right over here, and the first significant ruler who really spread that empire was Sargon, often referred to as Sargon the Great. And you can see, you can see that that would have been established around the middle of the 23rd, or actually the 24th century BCE."
Social Studies,"So around 2350, you have Sargon establishing what might be the first Dynastic empire in the world, the Akkadian Empire, and he was able to take control of both northern and southern Mesopotamia, so even the Sumerians were under the control of the Akkadians. As we'll see over time, you have a lot of mixing between the Akkadian language, the Sumerian language."
Social Studies,"Akkadian gets written in the Cuneiform script, and starting at around this period, Sumerian starts to die as a spoken language and Akkadian really becomes dominant. Now, the Akkadians rule for a little over 100 years, and then you have several other empires. It can get confusing. The way I have structured this timeline is this top line right over here is southern Mesopotamia and this bottom line right over here is northern Mesopotamia so this orange shows you where the Sumerians were reigning."
Social Studies,"Some people think that they might have been the first empire. This bottom line here, you can see the Akkadian speakers, but they were fragmented until you have Sargon the great establishing the Akkadian Empire. Now, you briefly then have a short-term neo-Sumerian empire, but the next significant empire that's often talked about when associated with Mesopotamia is the Babylonian Empire."
Social Studies,"So Babylon, the Babylonian Empire was centered at Babylon, right over here, and it really became a significant empire under the ruler Hammurabi. And Hammurabi is perhaps most known, you can see how he was able to spread the empire."
Social Studies,"The dark brown is what he had with this empire when he took rule, and the light brown is what he was able to spread it to, so once again, both north and south, and he's perhaps most famous for his famous code of Hammurabi, which is depicted here, and it wasn't the first written code, but it was one of the earliest, and you could view it as almost a proto-constitution, and it was based on things that the Sumerians had before, but they've even influenced things like biblical laws, things that come down to modern codes of law today."
Social Studies,"Now, after the Babylonians, the other significant empire that would have control over significant portions of Mesopotamia is the Assyrian Empire. And the Assyrian Empire is named for their, I guess you could say their home base, the town of Assur. You can see it in this map here, where we showed the Akkadian Empire."
Social Studies,"And both the Babylonians and the Assyrians were Akkadian speaking, so at this point now, and as we get into the later Assyrian period, we'll start to have Aramaic be a more significant language, another Semitic language, but as you can see here, the Assyrian Empire at its peak controlled much of the modern day Middle East. Now, the Assyrian Empire would eventually collapse in the seventh century BCE, and it would be taken over by the Neobabylonian Empire."
Social Studies,"I have a map of that right over here, which also controlled much of the modern middle east. Probably the most famous ruler of the Neobabylonian Empire was Nebuchadnezzar II from the Hebrew bible famous for taking the early Jewish people captive, the famous Babylonian captivity, but eventually they would be overthrown, and they would be overthrown in the sixth century BCE by the Persians and Cyrus the Great, and that'll actually be the end of the Babylonian captivity according to biblical accounts."
Social Studies,"But the big picture is that Mesopotamia is called the cradle of civilization for a good reason. Not only do we have these technological and architectural advancements, their religion, their writing has influenced civilization since, for the last five, six, 7,000 years. Well, I'd say definitely the last 5,000 years, and a lot of these ideas that came out of Mesopotamia, like written codes of law and the technologies and all the rest follow with us today.."
Social Studies,It rivals the Amazon River as the longest river and it sources the tributaries of the Nile Rover start even south of this picture and the water flows northward and eventually its delta reaches the Mediterranean Sea.
Social Studies,"The delta, which is where a river opens into the sea, is called a delta because, as you can see, these rivers, you can even see it from the satellite pictures right over here, they start branching up a bunch and you have this upside down triangular region, which looks a little bit like an upside down Greek letter delta, so that's why river delta is called that. And this one just happens to be upside down. If it was flowing the other way, it would be a right-side-up delta."
Social Studies,"So the Nile River, it flows from, you could say, eastern mid-Africa up into the Mediterranean Sea and because it has this northward flow, the southern parts of the river are upriver and they are actually called the Upper Nile. So, Upper. The Upper Nile is actually south of the Lower Nile, of the Lower Nile. And once again, that's because the Upper Nile is up river, it's also flowing from higher elevations to lower elevations. So as you go south, you get to higher and higher elevations."
Social Studies,"Now, the reason why the river is so important, we studied this multiple times, rivers are a source of fresh water, when they flood they make the surrounding soil fertile, they're suitable for agriculture, and the Nile Valley is one of the first places that we see agriculture emerging during the neolithic period. In fact, human settlement we believe was along this Nile River Valley as far as 6,000 BCE or 8,000 years ago, and it might have been there even further back in time."
Social Studies,"And because you have that agriculture, it allowed for higher population densities, which allowed for more specialization of labor and more complex societies. It's not a coincidence that some of the first, that one of the first great civilizations emerged here."
Social Studies,"Now, the story of the Nile River, or of Egypt, and actually they are tied very closely, even though Egypt is considered a lot of this region, most of the human population, this is true even today, is right along the river, around that fertile soil, where the agriculture actually occurs. In fact, this was so important to the ancient Egyptians that their whole calendar, their seasons, were based on what the Nile River was doing."
Social Studies,"They had a season called the inundation, or the flooding of the river, which makes the soil fertile. They had a season of growth, which is now talking about the growth of the crops and they had a season of harvest. And so you had people in this valley for thousands of years, but when we talk about ancient Egypt, we formally talk about it as a civilization around 3,100, 3,150 BCE. And this is where we get to our timeline right over here."
Social Studies,"So we're talking about right around there on our timeline and the reason why this is considered the beginning of the ancient Egyptian civilization is this is when we believe that upper and lower Egypt were first united under the king and there's different names used, Narmer sometimes or Menes. I'm going to mispronounce things every now and then and I'm probably doing it here as well."
Social Studies,"And so he was the king that unified upper and lower Egypt into an empire and the empire, as we will see, which lasted thousands of years, every one of these spaces is a hundred years. We're gonna go over huge time span, but the ancient Egyptian civilization is roughly divided into three kingdoms. You have the old kingdom, which went from about, right from about the 27th century BCE up to about the 17th century BCE. You have the middle kingdom and you have the new kingdom."
Social Studies,"And once again, this is spanning right over here over a thousand years of history. And in between those, you have these intermediate periods where the kingdom or the empire was a little bit more fragmented. You have in some of these intermediate periods, you have some foreign rule."
Social Studies,"But just to get a sense of some of what happened over this thousands of years, and I'm kind of laughing in my head because it's hard to cover over two, 3,000 years, in the course of just a few minutes, but this will give you a sense of what ancient Egyptian civilization was all about. Now the kings are referred to as pharaohs but as we'll see that term pharaoh is not really used until we get to the new kingdom."
Social Studies,"But I will refer to the kings as pharaohs throughout this video, just to say, hey these are the Egyptian kings. And the old kingdom is probably most known today in our popular culture for what we most associate with ancient Egypt and that is the pyramids. And here, right over here are the pyramids, there's the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is near modern-day Cairo today. This is the Sphinx and they were built in that old period under the Pharaohs Sneferu and Khufu, right over here in the 26th century BCE."
Social Studies,"And we are still trying to get a better understanding of how this was done. We actually now don't believe that it was done by slave labor, but instead it was done during, you could say, the off season by the peasants as a form of taxation."
Social Studies,"Okay, you're done planting or harvesting your crops? Well now that you have some time, and this shows actually the importance of agriculture for freeing people up, so to speak, why don't you help the pharaohs built these massive tombs, which I've seen various estimates that it might have taken some place between 10 and 100,000 people several decades to build each. But these are even today, these were built over 4,500 years ago, are some of the most iconic symbols that humanity has ever created."
Social Studies,"And the reason why we know so much about ancient Egypt is that we have been able to decipher their writing. It's a symbolic, they have these pictographs, these hieroglyphics, I'm sure you've heard of the word before, and for a while we had no idea what they said."
Social Studies,"We would see these encryptions in these tombs and we had a sense that, okay these tombs, especially things like the pyramids would be for these great kings, we could tell that it was a stratified society, that nobility had better tombs than others, but we didn't really have a good sense of what was going on until we discovered this, which is the Rosetta Stone, which was discovered in 1799. The reason why this is so valuable is it has the same text written in three different languages."
Social Studies,"It has it written in the hieroglyphs of the ancient Egyptians, and it has it written in a later script used in Egypt, called demotic Egyptian, and most importantly, it has it also written in Greek. And so historians were able to say, okay, we can now start to decipher what these symbols mean because we have a translation of them and that's why it's one of the first civilizations where we're able to put the picture together. And hieroglyphics are one of the first forms of writing."
Social Studies,"But let's now go on in our journey through thousands of years of ancient Egyptian civilization. Between the old kingdom and the middle kingdom, you have the first intermediate period and then you have the middle kingdom and then you have the Hyksos, which are Semitic people, Semitic referring to their language being of the same family as Semitic languages like Arabic, or Hebrew, or Aramaic. But then you have the new kingdom, and the new kingdom is considered to be the peak of ancient Egypt."
Social Studies,"It's really the height of their technology, it's the height of their military capability. And there are several pharaohs that are worthy of note in the new kingdom. The first is, he was born Amenhotep or he was originally known as Amenhotep the Fourth and then he eventually names himself Akhenaton and Akhenaton means effective for Aton, Aton being a significant Egyptian god. And the reason why he changed his name is he decides that, okay we have, the Egyptians have this huge pantheon of gods."
Social Studies,"Here is just the some of them right over here, this is the god Osiris, often associated with the afterlife or transition, regeneration, resurrection. You have the god Amun here and his first name Amenhotep, it means Amun is satisfied."
Social Studies,"What is considered kind of the equivalent of Zeus, you have the god here Horus once again a very significant god at different times in Egypt, but what was interesting about Amenhotep the Fourth or Akhenaton, whichever name you want to use, is he decided, no, no, no, I don't like this pantheon, this polytheistic religion that we have, I wanna worship one god, and the god that he decides to worship is really the, you could consider it the sun god, or the sun disc, and its representation looks something like this and it was referred to as Aten and so he changes his name to Akhenaton and he actually starts to try to get rid of evidence of these other gods or to make them a lot less important."
Social Studies,"And so the reason why that's notable is this is viewed as perhaps one of the first attempts at monotheism, at least within this ancient Egyptian civilization. He's also noted for giving a lot of power to his wife, to the queen, Nefertiti, who some people say was second in command, or even co-ruled alongside him. Now he was also famous because after his death, eventually, his son, King Tut, Tutankhamen, comes to power."
Social Studies,"And the reason why King Tut, as he's often known, although it's Tutankhamen, is known is because we were able to find his tombs in relatively good order and so he's become a popular part of the imagination. And he's known as a child pharaoh. He comes to power when he's very young, he dies at 18 and so it's kind of an interesting story. Now, most prominent amongst all of the pharaohs across Egyptian history, and this is also in the new kingdom, comes a little bit after Tutankhamen, is Ramses the Second."
Social Studies,"And Ramses the Second, who emerges here in the 13th century, and he rules for most of the 13th century BCE, he represents really the peak of Egypt, ancient Egypt, as a military power. He's famous for the Battle at Kaddish, which is the earliest battle where we actually know what the tactics and the formations were and it was with the also significant Hittite Empire in 1274 BCE, this is an image drawn much, much later, of the Battle of Kaddish."
Social Studies,"The battle, we now believe, might have been a bit of a stalemate, Ramses the Second wasn't able to capture Kaddish, but has told us a lot about military tactics and strategy and formation of that time. Historians today think it might have been the largest chariot battle maybe ever. So this was a significant thing that happened."
Social Studies,"Now, eventually the new kingdom does collapse, as we get to the end of the second millennium, and then over the next several hundreds of years, we're talking about a very long period of time, it gets fragmented, you have several rulers, you have the Kushites rule from the Upper Nile, the Kushites were in this area right over here. They rule for a brief period."
Social Studies,"The Assyrians, that's a Mesopotamian civilization, they rule for a small period of time, and then eventually and we talk about this in some detail in other videos, you have the Persians take over, you have Cambyses, Cyrus the Great's son, he's able to rule over, he's able to conquer Egypt and Egypt becomes part of the Achaemenid Empire for a while until the conquering of Alexander the Great."
Social Studies,"And after Alexander the Great dies, one of his generals and his dynasty takes over, Ptolemaic Egypt and now it's being ruled by foreigners, well it's been ruled by foreigners for a while now, but now it's by the Greeks and the famous Cleopatra, who's considered a pharaoh of Egypt, she's actually Greek by blood, she's actually the one that seduced you could say Julius Caesar and Marc Antony and after Cleopatra's death, more and more, actually eventually it becomes part of Rome."
Social Studies,"So as you can see we covered this enormous large time period in history, one of the most significant civilizations in all of history, one of the most famous poems about civilizations and rulers, about Ramses the Second, the poem Ozymandias was named after him. You have some of the great cities of the ancient world, Thebes, which was the capital during parts of the new kingdom and the middle kingdom, you have Memphis, which was one of the, some people say founded by Menes and the capital of the old kingdom."
Social Studies,These were all happening in ancient Egypt..
Social Studies,"But on the other side, you have an olive branch, a symbol of peace. DR. BETH HARRIS: That's not so different than this object that we're looking at that's nearly 4,500 years old, an object known is the Standard of Ur, which comes from the city-state of Ur, which is now in present day Iraq. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: In Mesopotamia, really the birthplace of civilization, and Ur is one of the great early cities."
Social Studies,"The word standard is a little misleading because a standard is really a flag that's often brought into battle. And the original excavator of this hypothesized that perhaps this was on a pole originally and was brought into battle. But in truth, we have no idea. DR. BETH HARRIS: So often, when we're in a museum, and we're talking about ancient objects, we're talking about objects that had been buried, but buried just because of the passage of time."
Social Studies,"And here we're looking at objects that were intentionally buried. They were part of what seems to have been an elaborate burial ritual. These were excavated in the '20s and the early '30s by a man named Leonard Woolley, who discovered about 16 tombs that he called royal tombs. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Again, we really don't know. But what we do know is that we see fabulously expensive objects. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: And one of those valuable objects was the object we call today the Standard of Ur, which is small but quite beautiful and elaborately decorated. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Historians have thought that perhaps this is a sound box for a musical instrument. Others have thought it might have contained something important, perhaps even the currency that was used to pay for warfare. We simply don't know. DR. BETH HARRIS: So that's one of the wonderful things about this object is that it tells us so much."
Social Studies,"And at the same time, it tells us so little. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So let's start off with just a simple description. So we have this object that is small enough so that it could easily be carried. DR. BETH HARRIS: One long side seems to represent a scene of peace and prosperity. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: It's divided into three registers. And it's framed with beautiful pieces of shell. Now, this is important because it really does show us the long distance trade that this culture was involved with."
Social Studies,"You've got blue lapis lazuli that came from mines in Afghanistan. You have a red stone that would come from India. And you've got the shells, which would have come from the gulf just to the south of what is now Iraq. And it reminds us that these first great cities were possible because agriculture had been successful."
Social Studies,"In the river valley between the Tigris and Euphrates, it was possible to grow a surplus of food that allowed for an organization of society where not everybody had to be in the field all the time. Once there was enough food, some people could devote their lives to being rulers and some to becoming artists or artisans. DR. BETH HARRIS: And some to priests, right? You had a whole organization of society with different people performing different roles that was suddenly possible. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: And you can see that organization represented in the three registers here. The most important, wealthiest, most powerful figures are towards the top. And then, we have the common laborers down at the bottom. DR. BETH HARRIS: And it's really typical in ancient Near Eastern art, for us to see scenes divided into registers. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So let's start at the bottom and move up. I see a human figure bearing a heavy bag. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: And that's really what we have along the entire bottom register, figures who seem to be bringing things to a destination. We see animals, figures carrying things across their shoulders or on their backs. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Just above that, you can see a number of people leading more clearly identifiable animals. You can see somebody herding along what looks like a sheep or a ram. You see a bull in front of that being led by two people."
Social Studies,"And then, perhaps goats, perhaps sheep, ahead of that, and another bull. These are people that might be bringing these animals to sacrifice. They might be bringing them as a kind of taxation. We really don't know. But people have hypothesized that this is showing a kind of collection, perhaps for the king, for the city. The register at the top clearly shows one figure that's more important than the rest. The king is larger, in fact so large that his head breaks into the pictorial frame. DR."
Social Studies,BETH HARRIS: And he also wears different clothing that helps to identify him. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: He's seated on a chair that is interesting because it's got three straight legs and one leg that seems to be the leg of an animal. DR. BETH HARRIS: Some of the objects that we see here are objects that were also found in the burials. But I don't think they found the chair that resembles that. That would be fun to see. DR.
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: One of the objects that has been found, however, are the cups that so many of the figures here are holding. And so clearly, these figures are joining the king in some libation. They're drinking perhaps beer, perhaps wine. We're not sure. DR. BETH HARRIS: There's some kind of celebration going on. Some festivity or perhaps a religious ceremony. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: It's worth noting that even the secondary figures here, that is the figures who are seated but are not the king, are larger than the servants that surround them that are standing. And so even within the register, you have a hierarchy that shows the relative importance of three levels of society. DR. BETH HARRIS: And then we have two figures at the far end who seem to be entertaining the seated figures who were drinking."
Social Studies,"One is playing a harp and another figure on the far right, perhaps singing. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: Let's go to the other side. It's a very different story. DR. BETH HARRIS: So again, we have a scene divided into three registers. But here, we see terrible scenes of violence. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: We see a rendering of what is pretty clearly warfare. There are four chariots that are pulled by what seem to be four male donkeys. On the back of each chariot seem to be a driver, as well as a warrior."
Social Studies,"The figure towards the rear, you'll notice, is holding either a spear or an ax. And then being trampled by the horses, perhaps felled by those weapons, are the enemy. If you look closely, you can see some extraordinary detail. Look at one of the men that has been felled under the horse, you can see his wounds. You can see blood flowing. And if you look closely you can notice the mechanism of the actual wheels of the chariots. There's a kind of specific engineering that's being rendered here. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: One of the most interesting things about the bottom panel is a kind of naturalism in the battle that seems to be taking place. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: You seem to move from a walk to a kind of canter to a full gallop. DR. BETH HARRIS: On the other hand, some elements are really symbolic, like the felled enemies that you were talking about before. I don't think we're meant to assume that there were actually just four people who died in this battle. That's the number we see."
Social Studies,"But clearly, that's symbolic of many more. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: The middle register shows a line of soldiers readied for battle. They are in full garb. They're wearing helmets. And these helmets have, again, been found in the so-called royal tombs. DR. BETH HARRIS: What's wonderful about these soldiers is their regular placement. That gives you a real sense of an army that's sort of marching along. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: You get a sense of order. You get a sense of structure. You get a sense of real discipline."
Social Studies,"But towards the middle of that register, you see the actual battle taking place. And you see these soldiers victorious, slaying their enemies. On the right side of that middle register, you see soldiers that are perhaps being captured. DR."
Social Studies,"BETH HARRIS: And our eye in the top register goes immediately to the large figure at the center, which is obviously, once again, the king, his head, again, breaks the decorative border along the top, on the left, a chariot and soldiers and on the right, other soldiers or attendants bringing to the king prisoners of war. And we can tell that these are prisoners of war because they're naked. They've been stripped. And they're wounded and bleeding. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: So there's the sense of their humiliation, their enslavement, and the great victory of the king. It's interesting to look closely at the stylistic conventions of the rendering of the figures. Just about everybody's seen in perfect profile. We see one eye. And that one eye is not so much looking forward as looking out. DR. BETH HARRIS: Right, it's sort of frontal, on the side of the face. DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: That's right."
Social Studies,"In a way that is familiar from Egyptian art, we see the shoulders squared with the picture plane. And we see feet pushing in one direction rather than being seen in perspective. DR. BETH HARRIS: So we can use our visual detective work, but there's still so much that's a mystery. DR."
Social Studies,"STEVEN ZUCKER: What it does tell us, though, is that the way that we tell a story, the way that we tell one over time, the way that we organize our society, even now, in the 21st century, has a lot in common with the third millennium BCE. [MUSIC PLAYING]."
Social Studies,"The Indus River runs mostly in modern-day Pakistan, and that's why it's called the Indus Valley civilization. Indus Valley Civilization. It's also sometimes referred to as the Harappan civilization, which was the first site where they found evidence of this fairly extensive civilization. Now to get ourselves acquainted in time, this shows when archaeologists, historians consider to be the main part of the Harappan civilization."
Social Studies,"There's evidence that people had basic villages, civilizations, agriculture here, as far back as 7,000 BCE, and that's just based on the evidence we have today, but when people refer to the Indus Valley civilization in particular, they're usually staring around 3300 BCE and in orange right over here, this is the early period, or you could say the early Indus Valley civilization."
Social Studies,"Now some of the biggest structures and pieces of technology that have been discovered have been right over here, which is often referred to as the mature period for the Indus Valley civilization, and then it goes into decline. We'll talk about why it might have gone into decline, although we're not really sure, and this is called the late."
Social Studies,"Now to put it in context relative to these other civilizations, remember the ancient Sumerians were starting to be quite, I guess you could say civilized, by about this period. You start having a lot of intermingling between the Acadians and the Sumerians as you get into the late third millennium. That's when you have the empire of Sargon the Great, the Acadian Empire."
Social Studies,"As you get to the end of this mature period right over here, this is close to or around the time of Hammurabi, the Babylonian Empire, and in Egypt, if you go back to around 2500, around this time, that's when the pyramids were built and you have the Egyptian Kings, these god-kings that were ruling for most of this period right over here and as we'll see, there was actually, we believe, a good bit of cultural interchange between the significant civilizations."
Social Studies,"Now just to appreciate how extensive this Indus Valley civilization was, I will show you this map. And this map, it's zoomed in of that region around the Indus Valley that I just showed you. This is a map of most of Pakistan here, and these red squares are places where they have found evidence of the civilization. The first place was Harappa, right over here, the Punjab region of Pakistan. And that's why it's called the Harappan civilization. But as you can see, it's much more than just around Harappa."
Social Studies,"The largest site is at Mohenjo-Daro, right over here in the Sindh region of Pakistan and it's believed that as many as 40,000 people lived in that city that we now, or that site, that we now call Mohenjo-Daro. And so far, we have discovered over 1,000 sites in this area and we believe that as many as five million people might have been part of the civilization. Now the reason why we think it is a civilization and now, and let me actually keep scrolling around so you appreciate the extent of it."
Social Studies,"There's sites in mainly, many in Pakistan that you see here. There's also quite a few in modern-day India right over here, so it's an extensive network of these sites and the reason why we think it's one civilization, or at least a connected culture, is that you find a lot of standardization. You find standardization in their weights and measures."
Social Studies,"In fact, they have a unit of measurement that's as small as 1.6 millimeters, and the reason why that's important is you wouldn't create a unit of measurement of 1.6 millimeters unless you knew how to use something, unless you know how to make things that precise. And one of the things that they made that precise are things like their structures. They had these standard bricks and this brick size and many of these symbols that they used were found throughout these sites."
Social Studies,"Which said we don't know whether they were controlled by one ruler or one emperor, but there was definitely a lot of cultural interchange to the point that they were using the same size bricks, they were using the same symbols, they were using the same units of measurement. And also, as you can imagine, having a unit of measurement that precise, that small implies that they were great builders. And the evidence we find today says yes, they were."
Social Studies,"This is a picture of the site at Mohenjo-Daro in modern-day Sindh Pakistan, and you can see how tight this brick work is, even by modern standards this is quite good. You'd need to think of how many things we would build would last 5,000 years in this good, being exposed to the environments. They think this was a public bath. You see a citadel in the background. We've discovered defensive structures. Perhaps most impressively, there is, or most impressive, there's sewage systems."
Social Studies,"They think houses had wells, water. So this was a technologically advanced civilization especially for that time. In many ways, more advanced than the other civilizations, the contemporary civilizations that we had talked about. Here are some examples of their sculpture or of their art. This is, this one right over here is a picture, it's called Dancing Girl, but she's not dancing, but they think that might be her profession. It's all speculation by archaeologists today."
Social Studies,"This they believe is called Priest-King, once again, it's all speculation. This is an example of the types of seals they made. This is their jewelry, once again, this is quite intricate jewelry, and this jewelry was not just discovered in archaeological digs in these various sites. There's evidence of their jewelry as far as Mesopotamia in digs there. And they believe that there was actually a very active maritime trade network between these areas."
Social Studies,"There's jewelry discovered in these Indus Valley civilizations that were based on shells from the Arabian peninsula. They have materials from China, so there's materials from other parts of India, so once again, a very very extensive trade network. These civilizations would have known about them. But as we said, they were extremely, they seemed somewhat organized. Even though we can't read their writing, in fact I have some examples of their writing here."
Social Studies,"And you might notice, so this is examples of their writing and you might notice there, this is turned into a somewhat infamous symbol now, because of the Nazis, this is a swastika. But the swastika was one of the symbols they used, it's a symbol in Hinduism, it's considered a symbol of good luck."
Social Studies,"It's something that the Nazis kind of usurped and turned it into a very negative thing, but it does show this connection between that Indus Valley or that Harappan civilization and modern cultures that are in India and things like the Hindu religion. Although once again, we do not know a ton about their religion because their language hasn't survived and we cannot decipher their actual writing."
Social Studies,"But because of their organization and the consistency, or relative consistency amongst these different sites that are so far flung, this is a large distance even on modern day terms, but especially if we're talking about four or five thousand years ago."
Social Studies,"Because of that, we think that, okay, there must have been at least decent government administration or organization at a city-state level, although we're unsure whether there was a connected empire, whether you had an organization beyond that or they all just decided to take each other's standards and symbols and brick sizes and things like that. Now, one of the key mysteries of the Indus Valley civilization is why did it end? It seemed to be this thriving civilization, perhaps the most extensive one."
Social Studies,"In other videos, I talk about right now, the oldest wheel was discovered in Mesopotamia, but some people think that the wheel might have been used even earlier in the Indus Valley civilization. I talk about this period, as early as 3300 BCE, but there's evidence that the civilization started much earlier. In the site right over here in Mehrgarh, right over here in Pakistan."
Social Studies,"They think that humans were having simple villages and agriculture as early, there's evidence as early as 7000 BCE and that site was discovered just in 1974. We might discover things that take us even further into the past, and when you have a civilization that was around for so long, if there were people there as early as 7000 BCE, we're talking about it was there for thousands of years, but all of a sudden, it starts to decline."
Social Studies,"There's evidence of less and less trade going on, less and less sophistication, and then it ends. And it's one of the mysteries of history, of archaeology today. Why did this Indus Valley civilization end? Some of the older theories were it was maybe it was a foreign invasion, maybe some of the ancestors of the modern Indians invaded, or maybe they assimilated it somehow. More current theories don't think that was the case."
Social Studies,"They think it might be some form of climate change, that some of the important rivers dried up, made the agriculture much harder. Some people think it might have been a natural disaster, it might have been a flood of some kind. But we just don't know. Or the people, for some reason, decided to leave, die, migrate to maybe other parts of the region. But needless to say, it was a significant civilization, and we're just scratching the surface of what we know about it."
Social Studies,"We know a lot and we know it was impressive, even though we can't read their script and we don't know as much about it as we know about ancient Mesopotamia and the ancient Egyptians, but signs are that as more time passes, we'll realize that it was more and more sophisticated and impressive than maybe we even appreciate today.."
Social Studies,"where we see some of the first great dynasties of Ancient China emerging. So if we go to roughly the 16th century, B.C.E., so that would be about 3600 years ago, we have the emergence of the Shang Dynasty, and what's significant about the Shang Dynasty is it's the first dynasty where we have significant archaeological evidence of its existence."
Social Studies,"We have a lot of evidence in this area where, do you see, highlighted in red, where the Shang Dynasty existed with its capital at Yin, near the modern-day city of Anyang. Now, we have accounts of a Dynasty before it, the Xia or the Chia Dynasty, although we do not have significant archaeological evidence of it. But the accounts say that the Xia Dynasty would have been around for roughly 500 years before we get to this 16th century B.C.E., with the emergence of the Shang Dynasty."
Social Studies,"Now just to get ourselves acquainted in time and space, and think about, well what else was happening around 1600 B.C.E., we could remind ourselves that that was during the new kingdom in Ancient Egypt, right around here, the height of Ancient Egypt's power was right around that time. We could think about the Hittite Empire that we study in other videos, we could think about Mycenaean Greece. Around 1600 B.C.E."
Social Studies,"is when you start having, or when you have the decline of the Indus Valley civilization, also known as the Harappan civilization, and you start to have the Vedic period, where you have these Indo-Aryan people start to migrate into Northern India. In Mesopotamia, you have the Assyrian Middle Kingdom right around here, so this is all happening in this mid- to late-second millennium B.C.E., which is roughly the time of the Shang Dynasty."
Social Studies,"Now the Shang Dynasty was known for many things, it was a Bronze Age culture, and you can see depicted here, many examples of that and this is pretty impressive work with bronze, this is a bronze battle axe right over here, you can imagine a handle for this axe, something like this, this is nothing that you would want to deal with in a battle, and you can see these other very significant, large, bronze crafts, handiwork, that the Shang Dynasty was able to produce."
Social Studies,"Now what the Shang Dynasty is also well-known for is their writing, it's the first evidence of a fairly advanced writing form, and it's related to modern Chinese. And a lot of that writing, the significant artifacts from that time are on what are called oracle bones."
Social Studies,"That's an oracle bone right over here, this is actually the scapula, the shoulder blade of an ox, and what they would do is they would write questions in this oracle bone script on top of that scapula of an ox and then they would heat it up in a flame or some type of source of heat until it cracks and then they would interpret the cracks to see what was the answer to their actual questions. And you can actually see how this oracle bone script is related to modern Chinese script."
Social Studies,"So this is Shang written in oracle bone script and you can see how it evolved over time to the modern-day Chinese script. Even though if you go straight from that to that, they look reasonably different, but when you look at the evolution, you can see that they have lot of commonality."
Social Studies,"You also see it in words, right over here, shows you evolution of the word tiger, and once again, this is the oracle bone script and you can see it looks right here like a picture of a tiger, but then it evolved over time to the modern form right over here."
Social Studies,"Now, this Shang civilization, it's no coincidence that first the Xia and then the Shang, that they develop over here in the yellow river and the Yangtze River valleys, we've talked about it, the Ancient Egyptians, the Mesopotamians, all of the Indus Valley civilization, they all started where agriculture first emerged, which tended to be in these river valley civilizations."
Social Studies,"Now the Shang in particular, not only were they known for their bronze work, they were known for their large cities, they were known for their complex social structures, they were known especially near the end of the Shang period, for having chariots, and some people think that because they had chariots, there might have been contacts with folks further west."
Social Studies,"Now the Shang Dynasty, I said how the Xia Dynasty lasted for over 500 years, and the Shang Dynasty also lasts for on the order of 500 years, which is a very very very very long time. But as we get to the middle of the 11th century B.C.E., it would reach its end."
Social Studies,"The last king of the Shang Dynasty is this gentleman right over here, this would be Dix Xin or Di Shin and the accounts have him initially in his rule as being a very capable ruler, but later in his rule, he seems to get more corrupt, becomes less competent of a ruler, his favorite consort Daji, right over here, she's a bit of a not-so-popular figure in Chinese history, a lot of people think that she helped, or they blame her for corrupting Di Xin, and so he eventually faces his end in the Battle of Muye, against King Wu of Zhou or Joe is actually the correct pronouncing, King Wu of Zhou, and King Wu of Zhou is able to defeat Di Xin at the Battle of Muye, and that is the end of Shang Dynasty and it begins the Zhou Dynasty, which will go on for another 800 years, that's pretty impressive, how continuous these dynasties actually are, and after that battle, Di Xin goes off and commits suicide, and this right over here is a depiction of King Wu of Zhou, who starts the Zhou Dynasty."
Social Studies,"But the big picture here is we're talking about huge swaths of time and we have a significant, I guess you could say, civilization, that started with the river valleys in China but it's amazing how continuous these civilizations were and it's almost amazing how modern their writing was relative to modern Chinese script and that's why historians believe that writing of this form was, because of how advanced it was, was probably in place for a long time before we see these oracle bones, so even though we don't have the strong archaeological evidence yet for the Xia Dynasty, there's a lot of evidence that by the time the Shang came about, the Chinese civilization was already quite well-developed around the Yellow River and the Yangtze.."
Social Studies,"The first evidence we have of the development of agriculture in the Americas is about seven to eight or nine thousand years ago so once again, it coincides with when agriculture, we believe, started to emerge in other parts of the world. And the more archeological evidence we find, we'll probably find dates that go even further back than that, in fact, I've seen some that go eight, nine thousand years ago."
Social Studies,"Now one misconception, significant misconception, about the Americas is that when the Europeans colonized, remember Columbus comes sailing in 1492, looking for the East Indies and then he bumps into this, he actually doesn't bump into the whole continent, he bumps into an island that's close to the continent, but with that you start having the beginning of the European colonization of the Americas, roughly the last 500 years, and one misconception that folks often have is, well it was maybe sparsely populated, mainly by hunter-gatherer nomadic people and nothing could be further from the truth."
Social Studies,"The modern estimates of the population of the Americas at the time of the European colonization, roughly around 1500 is 50-100 million people and to put that in perspective, so that's right around there, that's about 10 to 20% of the world population at that time."
Social Studies,"The world population at that time was about 500 million people and given that the Americas is about one third of the land, if you don't count Antarctica, it's not that different of a population density than the other continents, and we have significant cities that were in place in the pre-Columbian era, in the era before Columbus and the European colonization."
Social Studies,"For example, you might have heard of the Aztecs, this really, the core, the Mexica people, the Mexica tribe, in many ways the foundations, of the Mexican people pre-European colonization. You might also be familiar with the Mayan civilization, one of the longest lasting civilizations in, actually, in history, they're famous for one of the earliest cultures where we have the hieroglyphics, where we have writing."
Social Studies,"You're probably familiar with the Inca Empire and yes, that is me on a recent trip and at the time of the Inca Empire it is believed that it was possibly the largest empire on the earth at that time, incredibly complex structures and social structures, they had. Now what's often less talked about are things like the Mississippian culture, which was in North America right over here. The Mississippi River is named for them. This if their famous city of Cahokia near St."
Social Studies,"Louis and in there, in that peak, it would have 40,000 people in it."
Social Studies,"Around the world at that time, at the time of the Mississippian culture, there weren't many cities in the world that had 40,000 people, so it wasn't these, just hunter-gatherers and people who were nomadic, there were sophisticated civilizations, with sophisticated cultures and dense population centers and it had also been in place for a long time, similar, in timeframe, to some of the great ancient civilizations that we see in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and in China."
Social Studies,"For example, the oldest civilization we know of, in Mesoamerica, is the Olmec civilization, right over here, here's a few of their artifacts they have. If we go into the Andes, near modern day Peru, we have the Chavin culture, right over there."
Social Studies,"As you can see, a lot of these cultures, at least the ones that I'm putting here, and this is just a sample, I'm sampling some around North America, some around Mesoamerica, and some in the Andes, and then you can even go further back and you can go to the Caral civilization, and what's really interesting about the Caral civilization is some archeologists call this the first civilization and it's unclear whether they had, whether they farmed grains and cereals that we often associate with civilizations, they use their surplus crops to have a more specialized labor force, but they were a maritime culture, even today the coast of Peru is a significant source of all of the, or a good chunk of the seafood in the world but a significant culture developed there, these are the remnants of their pyramids, and they developed, we believe, in the 4th millennium BCE, so this is around the same time as when Egypt first got unified around Menes, by Menes, or you have the first Sumerians in Mesopotamia and as far back as them you have these Quipus knots, which many archeologists view as a form of writing, it was a form of record-keeping and it was even used later on by the Incas."
Social Studies,"So the big take away here, is to challenge that misconception that the Americas somehow were not as, has populations and civilizations like everything else, it was only when the Europeans came in that all of that started to happen, no."
Social Studies,"Well before the Europeans came in, North and South America had been settled, agriculture developed at a similar timescale, significant, complex civilizations, writing developed on a similar timescale, but once you have the European colonization, some people say it was intentional, it was probably a combination of intentional and just diseases that were unfamiliar to the people here, within 150 years, that 50 to 100 million population, so now we're talking about, roughly by 1650, so you move a little bit forward in time, the population had gone to roughly six million people, some people refer it to a genocide, some people would say it's a combination of an intentional extermination of people plus just inadvertent disease, whatever it is, this was the significant decline of a complex and diverse set of populations."
Social Studies,"This is just a small sample of the major civilizations that were there, you had thousands of tribes across North and South America that had different cultures, different languages, different traditions and different religions.."
Social Studies,"In geological time, era means several hundred millions of years. Periods and ages mean millions of years. When an archaeologist, when we're studying the human past, this is just talking-- they're just generally talking about long segments of human time, but not in the millions of years, usually in the thousands or the ten thousands of years."
Social Studies,"So what I want to do with that out of the way is talk about what has happened in the distant human past, or the distant pre-human past, and also touch on some of the classifications for these segments of time-- because they actually tell us what were the interesting developments that happened to humanity over the 200,000 years that Homo sapiens have been on this planet, or that we believe that Homo sapiens have been on this planet."
Social Studies,"So the longest period of time in human past, or the category of human time-- and there are different ways you can categorize it-- is the Paleolithic Era right over here. And what really makes that period of time-- so this begins even in prehistory or pre-human history, so before Homo sapiens even existed-- you have the beginning of the Paleolithic Era that really began with the development of stone tools."
Social Studies,"And as we learned in the video on human evolution, there were pre Homo sapiens species that were using stone tools. And so the Paleolithic Era, it's really kind of signified by one, the stone tools, but even more-- that either the pre-humans-- or once you go about 200,000 years ago-- the humans show up. It's kind of distinguished by humans being hunter-gatherers, which essentially means to survive, we used to walk around a lot."
Social Studies,"If we couldn't see something obvious to hunt, maybe a woolly mammoth or something, if we didn't see something obvious to hunt, we would look around for snails, or mushrooms, or whatever else. And that's how we would survive. That's how we would live. And because we were constantly adapting to our environment based on the seasons, we were maybe following animals as they migrated, hunter-gatherers were fundamentally nomadic, which means that they never settled in one place for a long time."
Social Studies,"They were always ready to pick up-- probably their tents-- and follow the herd, or follow whatever animals they were hunting, or follow the season, so they could go to warmer climates, maybe, where they're more likely to find something on the ground to eat, maybe, during the winter. Or who knows. So the Paleolithic Era is really distinguished by that. It's a huge swath of time in human history. And it doesn't come to an end until you get to the advent of farming."
Social Studies,"So the Paleolithic Era, I mean, we're literally talking about over two million years ago was when it starts-- before Homo sapiens even existed as a species. And it goes all the way to the advent of farming, that we believe first came about around 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. And this abbreviation right here, this BP, this does not stand for British Petroleum. It stands for Before Present, or before the present time. So one more acronym to have in your tool kit when you see things."
Social Studies,"And obviously, if we're 11,000 years before the present, that's the same thing as 9,000 years Before Christ, or Before the Common Era. Because Christ was, we believe, born 2,000 years ago. Now, it may or may not be obvious to you, but the advent of agriculture is a super big deal, arguably the biggest deal in the development of human civilization, or in all of human history. And you might say, hey, you know, what's the big deal about agriculture? These characters over here look pretty happy."
Social Studies,"They're able to walk around a lot. They're able to hunt. What's the big deal of all of a sudden people plowing fields, and domesticating cattle, and having chickens to lay eggs, and whatever else? And the big deal about that-- besides the fact that it would change people's diet-- is that for the first time, it allowed them to not be nomadic. It allowed them to-- and you could have probably had some hunters who were somewhat settled, maybe living near the ocean."
Social Studies,"Maybe they did some fishing, and all the rest. But for the most part, with the development of agriculture, it forced people to stay in one place. So you have the Paleolithic Era all the way to the advent of agriculture, which was about 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. And besides the fact that it changed people's diet, it allowed them to settle. So agriculture allowed human beings to settle down in one area."
Social Studies,"And it wasn't just that they were settling in one area, but because they were able to control their environment, they were able to increase the density of things, of crops that humans could consume, and animals that humans could consume-- and lower the density of crops that humans can't consume, and animals that they can't consume, or that they don't want around, like pests of some type. What it allowed them to do is also settle in more dense environments."
Social Studies,"You can imagine when you just have people walking around, you need a lot of land to support even the calorie requirements of one human being. But all of a sudden, if you are able to develop agriculture, you're able to domesticate animals. All of a sudden you could have-- in the same amount of land, you could have more calories being generated. And because you have more calories being generated in a smaller amount of land, people can settle. And they can settle in a denser environment."
Social Studies,"And so agriculture was really this necessary requirement for people to develop civilization, or to develop villages and cities. And maybe also giving them the free time to start thinking about hey, maybe we want to think about how we can record what we know, how we can develop even more technologies."
Social Studies,"And so just to give us a sense of the categorization that an archaeologist would use for these different periods of time-- I told you we start with the Paleolithic Era, with the advent of stone tools, pre-humans-- most of human time on this planet. And then about 11,000 years ago, the development of agriculture. And it developed independently at different places around the world, which is by itself an interesting phenomenon."
Social Studies,"And people think that it might just be that be the climate might have warmed up a little bit, so that people-- maybe naturally there were some human edible crops that existed in a little bit of a denser environment, and humans learned to optimize that slowly, and they did that independently."
Social Studies,"But it's an interesting question of why did it develop just then after 180,000, 190,000 years, why did agriculture all of a sudden happen? But just to get the terminology-- the Paleolithic Era is that period before agriculture. And then once agriculture starts developing, we are now in the Neolithic Era. And some archaeologists will describe a transition period between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic Era called the Mesolithic."
Social Studies,"And just so you know what these words mean-- because they actually make sense when you know what they mean, paleo means old and lithic means stone, or of stone. So they're really talking about the Old Stone Age. Neolithic, as you could imagine, means new stone. So it's kind of the New Stone Age. And meso means middle. So it is the Middle Stone Age."
Social Studies,"So another way of thinking about this whole period from when people were hunter-gatherers all the way to about 11,000 to 7,000 years ago when they developed agriculture-- this whole period is called the Stone Age. And the Stone Age is this biggest age. And there's just different ways of describing it, because if you just call it the Stone Age you're really making importance out of the actual tools that people could shape. They weren't able to use metal at this point."
Social Studies,"When you refer to Paleolithic and Neolithic, you're maybe referring a little bit more-- and there's other ways to think about it-- but you're referring a little bit more to the lifestyles of the human beings-- Paleolithic being hunter-gatherers, Neolithic having actually settled, having actually started to develop primitive villages, and even cities. And then of course Mesolithic is in between."
Social Studies,"And just for a pop culture reference, you might have heard of the Paleolithic diet that some people are going on now. And those are people who try to live like hunter-gatherers. Their belief is that most of human evolution occurred while we were hunter-gatherers, and so that's what our bodies are most accustomed to. So they like to eat meat. And they like to eat a lot of nuts. And I even met, I had a coworker once who used to only eat raw meat."
Social Studies,"And I don't know if that is even justified, or that's even somehow validated by the archaeological record. These people probably did cook their meat. Now, at the end of the Stone Age, we would have, I would say, the number two most significant development in human history. And now we're talking about 3,000 BC, which is about 5,000 years ago. And this is the development of writing. So we were hunter-gatherers about 9,000 to 10,000, 11,000 years ago. People started developing agriculture."
Social Studies,"It allows them to settle in more dense environments. It also gives them a little bit more free time, because they don't have to hunt and gather all the time. And then you go and once again, we'll probably discover things as we go forward in time that maybe these dates need to be pushed back, or whatever else, or we discover new civilizations, or who knows. But our best sense is you have these villages. You have these civilizations developing."
Social Studies,"And by about 5,000 years ago-- so this would be 5,000 before the present, or 3,000 BC-- Before Christ-- you have people saying, hey, why don't we start trying to write down what we know so that when I tell someone orally, it doesn't actually lose information there? And then so our descendants can slowly collect all of the knowledge we have, and maybe accelerate-- I don't know if they did it explicitly thinking of these, but let's just write down what we know."
Social Studies,"And so at about that period of time, you have-- as far as we can tell-- the first development of a pictogram-based system of writing. And the earliest system of writing we know is cuneiform, which is from the Sumerian civilization, which is now in present-day Iraq. And what's the really big deal about this is that this is, on some level, the beginning of recorded history. We could talk about the word history."
Social Studies,"You could say that history is all of the past, and we could use the archaeological record to figure out stuff before people started to write things down. But when they started to write things down, now it was recorded. Now we're actually getting actual accounts of what people know, of actual people's knowledge."
Social Studies,"And the reason why this is a big deal-- I mean agriculture, hopefully you now appreciate that it was a pretty big deal-- but the reason why writing was a big deal, is that now civilization could collect its knowledge. And it could build upon it generation after generation, without having to worry about people forgetting it, or information getting distorted verbally from ancestor to descendant. And with that, you also have the beginning of the Bronze Age."
Social Studies,"And the Bronze Age is kind of known for this beginning of-- even though it's referring to a material, which comes from the first time that people started using bronze as a tool, or using bronze for their tools, and for their weapons-- and bronze, it's a mixture of mostly copper and a little bit of tin. But the Bronze Age-- at least in my mind-- the biggest deal of what started at the beginning of the Bronze Age really, really was the writing."
Social Studies,"So once again, just as a review, because I actually, I find this kind of confusing-- our current understanding, most of human prehistory, and even pre-human prehistory were spent as hunter-gatherers using stone tools, until about 11,000 years ago. And then we became a little bit more settled. We became farmers essentially, using stone tools. And then you fast forward another about 5,000, 6,000 years. And then we started to become farmers who started to write down the things that we knew."
Social Studies,And we started to use bronze tools..
