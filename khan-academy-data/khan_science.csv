Science,"Iman, why should folks be excited about this? - So Middle school Earth and Space Science is really exciting because it's one of those areas of science that answers what's happening in our universe."
Science,"And then like when you dig in, you're like ""What is happening in our universe? This is why we have seasons."" And so we start like really big, we go all the way to outer space and we figure out sort of earth's position in our solar system and the relationship to gravity and our inner planets and our outer planets. And then we keep digging in and we finally figure out how Earth's position answers seasons."
Science,"It's not because we get closer to the sun or how based on earth's position, we look up at the moon and you'll see a lunar eclipse or how you don't look up and look at a solar eclipse, like seriously don't look up because it'll hurt your corneas. And then we keep going and we talk about water and how the same water that you're drinking right now is the exact same water that dinosaurs drink. And then we get into the rock cycle and we figure out why mountains are here and how we're moving right now."
Science,"Literally the plates below us are moving and how at one point we could walk across all the way from the US to Africa and how plate tectonics really changed that. And then finally, finally, we talk about us. We talk about us on this planet and how there's so many amazing resources here and how well how we use them really impacts the earth and how that could impact our climate. And really awesome things that you can do as a learner to change all that and make this earth really awesome."
Science,"What are you excited about, Sal? - Well, I'll just double down everything you said and I like how you said we're gonna dig into it 'cause it's very appropriate pun for earth, earth and space. This starts to answer the questions of, the from the cosmos to earth. Over billions of years, as you mentioned, the earth is alive in certain ways with the plates are still moving it's active and we should say at least, and you know we are part of the earth."
Science,"Your point, the, the water in our bodies the air that we breathe, it's the same water and earth that has been been here and the air for billions and billions of years. So to be able to actually understand that it, it actually gives me, gives me goosebumps. So I think folks will be very excited about this course. - Absolutely. (upbeat music)."
Science,"Our understanding about this has improved over time, and we have developed models that can help us understand something as vast as space. Now, models are just a way of representing a system of ideas that help us identify and understand patterns that we see. Models are a tool that can explain, and predict what we see in the world and space around us. And as we gain new information, we can update our models."
Science,"So what kind of model might we construct about how Earth interacts with other bodies in the universe? To begin with, every day, we can see the sun rise in the east, and set in the west, and other objects in the sky follow a similar pattern. It was logical then for early models to consider the Earth as a stationary object, around which all of the universe revolves. This is called a geocentric model, geo for Earth, and centric for center."
Science,"And this geocentric model was quite good at explaining a lot of the things that we see in the sky, like the apparent motion of the sun and the stars. But there were issues with this geocentric model. For example, the motions of other planets in the sky. A planet like Jupiter might sometimes move backwards in the opposite direction, which isn't really very well explained by this geocentric model. Now, when a model doesn't match our observations like this, we can add new pieces to improve the model."
Science,"So astronomers working with the geocentric model did this by adding smaller cycles within the planets' orbits around the Earth. Adding these cycles did help match the geocentric model to the observations, but there were many of these cycles required, and there wasn't a good explanation for why these cycles existed. And there wasn't very much reasoning for them, and they made the model very complicated, and not particularly useful."
Science,"Let's pause and talk a little bit about motion, specifically apparent versus actual. Imagine you're sitting in a car, and driving through a forest. To your perspective, as you look out the window, the trees seem to be whizzing by, but trees, of course, are rooted to the ground. It's actually you that are moving relative to the surface of the Earth. This is the difference between apparent and actual motion. So back to our geocentric model."
Science,"Another way to explain some of the issues with a model like the geocentric model, besides adding evermore complicated features to it, is to in fact, just come up with a new model. And this is what astronomers did. The new model that was proposed to replace the geocentric model was the heliocentric model. In this model, the Earth and all the other planets actually revolve around the sun. Helio means sun."
Science,"This heliocentric model didn't need complicated and unexplained cycles to explain the way the other planets moved across the sky. It was an expected outcome of the planets' orbits. Now you may be wondering, in this model, the sun is stationary. So why does it seem to be moving across the Earth's sky each day? This is actually also easily explained, because the motion of the sun in the sky is not actual motion, it is apparent motion."
Science,"Not only is the Earth revolving around the sun, revolving means orbiting, but the Earth is also spinning on its own axis. And so as the surface of the Earth moves with its spinning motion, it makes it appear as if the sun is moving across the sky. The spinning of the Earth actually explains why celestial objects appear to rise and set over the course of a day, while the revolution, or orbit, around the sun explains the motion of those objects over the course of a year."
Science,"It's important to remember that while the heliocentric model does a better job of explaining and predicting our solar system, which is what we want models to do, it is still a model, and not a perfect recreation of reality. For example, while the heliocentric model considers the sun as stationary, we know now that the sun is actually just one star of many billions orbiting the center of our own galaxy. And so the sun, along with the rest of the solar system, is in fact, moving."
Science,"To summarize, in this video, we talked about how we can use models to help us understand what we see in the sky, and Earth's place in space. As we learn more, we improve our models, and we can develop new ones that do a better job of explaining our observations, and predicting the world around us, such as the change from a geocentric model to a heliocentric model. The Earth then is a planet that orbits the sun, like the other planets of the solar system."
Science,"And the sun appears to move across the sky, because the Earth spins on its axis. Thanks for watching, and I hope you learned a little bit of something.."
Science,"This is called the heliocentric model. And the solar system is an enormous space for us, encompassing every place that humans or our robots have ever been. But it's actually quite small, cosmically speaking. Even our furthest spacecraft, Voyager 1, has only traveled less than 0.1% of the distance to the nearest star. Our solar system is just a small component of a much, much larger set of structures. The sun is just one star of hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy, which is called the Milky Way."
Science,"And our galaxy is one of several dozen in our galaxy group, which is called the Local Group. Other galaxies might belong to larger collections that are called galaxy clusters. Now the same thing that holds Earth in its orbit around the sun is what holds together massive groups and clusters of galaxies: gravity. This is the same as the gravity that makes a ball fall back to the ground when you toss it up into the air."
Science,"Gravity is a force that operates between two objects that have mass and tries to pull them closer together, whether those objects are a ball and the Earth or two galaxies. Now the strength of this pull depends on two things. First is the mass of both objects. So as either object gets more massive, the strength of gravity increases. For example, you have a lot more mass than a ball."
Science,"So the force of gravity between you and the Earth is pulling harder than the force of gravity between a ball and the Earth, and that's why it's a lot harder to throw you into the air than a ball. Gravity also depends on the distance between the centers of the objects. As the objects get farther apart, the strength of gravity decreases."
Science,"For example, if there is a ball on top of Mount Everest, the pull of Earth's gravity on it is actually slightly less than the pull of gravity on that same ball at sea level, because the top of the mountain is farther away from the center of the Earth. Now, this is a very small effect, less than a percent difference, because the difference between sea level and mountaintop is still very small compared to the distance to the center of the Earth. But that's just on Earth."
Science,"We know that things in space are really far apart. The Earth is almost 93 million miles, that's 150 million kilometers, from the sun. So if gravity is weaker when objects are farther apart, then in order for gravity to be keeping these structures bound together, they must be really massive, and they are. The sun has a mass of about two nonillion kilograms. That's 10 to the power of 30."
Science,"And the Milky Way galaxy, which is about a quintillion kilometers in diameter, has a mass of about 1.5 trillion times that of the sun. So thanks to their high masses, objects like our Milky Way galaxy and our nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, which are the two largest galaxies in the local group, can be pulled together by gravity, even across millions of light years."
Science,"In fact, gravity between our two galaxies is so strong that it's actually pulling the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies together into an eventual collision. But eventually in this case means almost 5 billion years from now, so no need to worry. To review, in this video we covered how the Earth is part of the solar system and our solar system is part of a galaxy, and our galaxy is part of a group. Galaxy groups, galaxies and solar systems are all bound together by the same force, that of gravity."
Science,Gravity is a force which tries to pull objects with mass closer together and it is weaker for less massive objects or for objects that are farther apart. Thanks for watching and I hope you learned a little bit of something..
Science,"Gravity flattened this material into a disc like this one and then pulled everything towards the center. Eventually, the pressure became so great that the star was formed. The sun, the remaining dust and gas particles collided with each other and eventually formed larger objects like Earth. Together, the sun and all the objects in space that as gravity keeps an orbit, make up our solar system. We call the biggest objects that orbit the sun, planets."
Science,"Our solar system has eight of them; Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These eight planets are divided by the asteroid belt. Asteroids are rocks that orbit the sun that are much smaller than planets and they're made up of nickel and iron. And unlike the planets, most asteroids aren't round. Beyond Neptune is the Oort cloud, a space at the very edge of the solar system that's filled with comets, which are like space snowballs that are made up of ice and dust."
Science,"Sometimes comets enter the inner part of our solar system and can even be seen from Earth with long tails of ionized gases. One of the most famous comets is Halley's comet, which only comes near Earth every 75 years or so. Be on the lookout for it in 2061. The four planets on the side of the asteroid belt, closer to the sun, are called the inner or terrestrial planets. The word terrestrial comes from the Latin word for Earth."
Science,"Terrestrial planets have solid, rocky surfaces, thin atmospheres, few or no moons and no rings. The closest planet to the sun is called Mercury. It's the smallest planet in the solar system and it doesn't have any moons. Next, there's Venus. It's the closest planet to Earth and like Mercury, it doesn't have a moon. Venus shines bright in the sky, like a star. It's about the same size as Earth, but you wouldn't wanna live on it."
Science,"It's the hottest planet in the solar system and its atmosphere contains an unbreathable mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid. Next is our home planet, Earth. Earth is the only planet known to have life on it. The last terrestrial planet in our solar system is Mars. Mars has a very thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide and it has two moons. We've sent robots called rovers to Mars in order to explore the planet surface. The planets on the other side of the asteroid belt are called the outer planets."
Science,"And unlike the inner planets, they're not made out of rock, instead, they're made out of gases and liquids and they have many moons and rings and they're much, much colder and much, much bigger than the terrestrial planets. For instance, the planet Jupiter is so big that it could fit about 1,300 Earths inside of it. We call Jupiter a gas giant, because, you guessed it, it's giant and made up of gas. Its atmosphere is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium. It has more than 50 moons."
Science,"One of Jupiter's moons, Ganymede, is bigger by volume than the planet Mercury is. Jupiter spins really fast on its axis. This means that a day on Jupiter is a little less than 10 hours long. If you travel another 650 million kilometers or so from Jupiter, you'd see Saturn, another gas giant. In 1610, Galileo Galilei became the first person to see Saturn's rings. Because his telescope wasn't strong enough, he couldn't tell what they were. He thought it looked like the planet had ears."
Science,"Even though Saturn's rings look smooth from a distance, they're actually made out of rocks and pieces of ice that orbit the planet because of Saturn's gravitational pull. The next planet is called Uranus. It's the sideways planet. Uranus has smaller rings than Saturn does and it's so far away from the Earth that we can only see it with a telescope. Even farther away from Earth, is the big and blue planet, Neptune. Because Neptune is so far away from the sun, it's really cold here."
Science,"The average temperature of Neptune is about negative 214 degree Celsius. It's also the windiest planet in our solar system with winds going at more than 2000 kilometers per hour. So if you ever visit, bundle up. The planets don't all take the same amount of time to orbit the sun. For example, it takes Jupiter 12 years to orbit the sun just once. And the same amount of time, Mercury has already orbited the sun nearly 50 times and Neptune hasn't even made it around once."
Science,"Although humans have visited the moon, we haven't built a rocket ship that can allow us to visit our neighboring planets yet. We've been able to learn more about our solar system by using other kinds of technology. Humans have built incredible telescopes that allow us to see into our solar system and beyond, and we've sent probes to other planets and captured stunning images."
Science,"Even with all this research, scientists are still learning new things about our solar system and its place in the rest of the universe. So maybe one day you could help solve some of the solar system's great mysteries too.."
Science,"And maybe it's the case that there's certain times of year when we are further from the sun, and there's other times of year when we are closer to the sun. Well, this doesn't actually hold up to why we have seasons because first of all, when the Northern Hemisphere the top half of Earth has winter, the bottom hemisphere has summer and vice versa."
Science,"So it can't just be due to the distance of the whole planet, it also turns out that when Earth is furthest from the sun is in July, which is in the middle of summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and when we are closest to the sun is actually in January which we know tends to be our colder season in the Northern Hemisphere. So distance to the sun does not hold up as to why we have seasons. The real reason why we have seasons is because of Earth's axial tilt, I guess you could say that or it's rotational tilt."
Science,"Now this picture shows that tilt but before we go into it, I'd like to remind folks that this is nowhere near drawn at scale. The actual sun has a diameter over 100 times out of Earth, a million Earths can fit in the sun and the actual distance between the Earth and the sun is over 100 times the diameter between the sun and Earth. But going back to tilt and you could see that here in this picture, Earth's north pole does not point straight up from the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun."
Science,"What do I mean by the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun? This red circle that you see, or this ellipse that you see, if you imagine that being on a surface of a table or a plane, that would be our orbital plane. And we can see that the north pole does not go straight up from that and the south pole does not go straight down, that actually we're looking at an angle of about 23.5 degrees. And that's the reason why we have the seasons."
Science,"To understand why that is the case, let's imagine Earth when the Northern Hemisphere is most pointed towards the sun, which happens in late June. And so let me draw the equator to help us visualize this a little bit and let's compare that to when the Northern Hemisphere is most pointed away from the sun, which happens in late December. And so I will draw the equator again to help us visualize this. And let's pick a similar point in the Northern Hemisphere."
Science,"So let's pick a point that's a little bit above the equator. So let's say that point and a comparable point in this scenario is going to be right over here. It's about that same distance above the equator. Notice, in late June in the Northern Hemisphere the sun is almost directly above this white point that we're seeing here. While in this scenario, the sun is at an angle. The surface of the Earth is more like this, so the sun's rays are coming at an angle."
Science,"And if you think about it, think about the scenario, the difference between when the sun is directly bearing down on something, versus when it is coming at an angle. Let's say this is a side view of two surfaces. And the surface on the right has twice the surface area. You can see the side view has twice the length, so the surface area if you were to see it in 3D would be twice the surface area of what we have on the left here."
Science,"But if you have the same amount of sun coming from the same direction, so here, let me just draw three sun rays here, this is just indicative and let me draw three sun rays here. Notice you have this same amount of energy but here you're hitting twice the surface area. So, the amount of energy per unit surface area is gonna be half as much in this scenario where the sun is coming at an angle versus this scenario where the sunlight is coming more directly on top of that point."
Science,"And wherever you go in the Northern Hemisphere the angle is less direct in the winter than it is in the summer. Now there's also some effects on the amount of daylight you get. For example, in the summer, when the Northern Hemisphere is most tilted towards the Earth, in the north pole, you're gonna have constant daylight and the south pole you're gonna have constant nighttime. And then the opposite happens when the Northern Hemisphere is pointed away."
Science,"And then when we think about spring and autumn in either hemisphere, you can see that the angle of Earth's rotation does not change from that 23.5 degrees, but in spring and autumn the Northern Hemisphere is not pointed to or away from the sun, it's kind of just pointed to the side. So in these two points, comparable points on the Northern or Southern hemisphere are seeing similar angles of the actual sunlight.."
Science,"It isn't a coincidence that the word moon is related to the word month in old English. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. A natural satellite is a naturally occurring body that orbits a planet. Some of the planets in our solar system have more than 50 satellites or moons, but the Earth just has one. The Moon does not generate its own light. We can see the Moon from the Earth, because it is partially lit by the light from the sun."
Science,"In fact, moonlight is just sunlight reflected from the Moon onto Earth. The Moon takes about 27 days to make a full orbit around Earth. And as it does, the lit part of the Moon appears to change shape to us here on Earth. These shapes are called the moon phases, or lunar phases. So why do we see different lunar phases? Well, the 27 days it takes the Moon to orbit the Earth once is the same amount of time it takes the Moon to rotate on its axis once."
Science,"This means that the same side of the Moon is always facing us. At the same time, the sun always lights up half of the sphere of the Moon. However, the side of the Moon that's facing us isn't always the same part of the Moon that the sun lights up. This causes the Moon to appear to have different shapes, or faces in the sky, depending on the time of the month. Let's take a closer look at the Moon's phases. First, we have the new moon, which happens when the Moon is closest to the sun in its orbit."
Science,"During this phase, the lit side of the Moon is completely facing away from Earth. So it looks like the Moon has disappeared. In a day or two, we'd be able to see a little sliver of moon in the sky. Over the next few days, the crescent moon will appear to get bigger and bigger. When the Moon appears to get bigger from one day to the next, we say that the Moon is waxing. So this phase of the Moon is called the waxing crescent moon."
Science,"You might notice that sometimes we can still see the rest of the Moon in the shadow. This is because the Earth reflects sunlight onto the Moon, just like the Moon reflects light onto Earth. Eventually, the Moon appears to change shape so much that it isn't a crescent anymore, but a half circle in the sky. This is called a first quarter moon. There are two ways to think about why this phase is called a quarter moon. Even though it looks like the Moon is half illuminated, the Moon is a sphere."
Science,"So we can only ever see half of the Moon from Earth. During a quarter moon, the Moon forms a right angle with Earth and the sun. This means that we a half lit portion of the half of the Moon that's always facing us. It's half of a half, so it's a quarter. Also, a first quarter moon occurs when the Moon is a quarter of the way through its new cycle. Next, there's the waxing gibbous moon. The word gibbous comes from the Latin word meaning humpback."
Science,"Once the Moon is farthest from the sun in its orbit, the full sun lit side of the Moon faces Earth. We call this phase the full moon, but the Moon is not done yet. It's only finished half of the cycle. Next, we have the same phases, but in reverse. As the Moon appears to get smaller and smaller, we say that it's waning. The full Moon appears to shrink, and then we see a waning gibbous. Then there's the third quarter moon."
Science,"This happens when the Moon is three quarters the way done with its cycle, and the Moon forms another right angle with the sun and the Earth. The Moon appears to shrink even more, and it becomes a waning crescent, and the cycle starts anew with another new moon. Even though the Moon completes an orbit every 27 days, the lunar phases actually repeat about every 29.5 days. This is because the Earth is revolving around the sun while the Moon completes its orbit."
Science,"So the Moon has to travel a little extra to catch up. The Moon isn't just something beautiful to look at in the sky, or just an easy way to keep track of time. The Moon's gravity controls the tides, which are the rise and fall of water in oceans, lakes, and rivers. Tides allow for unique ecosystems, like tide pools to exist. And we can use the tides to create electricity, and tidal power plants. The Moon also helps keep Earth's access stable."
Science,"Without it, our planet would wobble more dramatically on its axis over long periods of time, which would change up our weather and our seasons. So even though your calendar is pretty unlikely to spontaneously combust tomorrow, you could still thank the Moon for being such a stabilizing influence, and good companion to our planet.."
Science,"The Incas believed that lunar eclipses happened when a giant jaguar ate the full moon. It turns out, lunar eclipses happen when the moon is covered by Earth's shadow. We can only see the moon because it reflects light from the sun. The moon doesn't generate any light of its own. The sun lights up half of the sphere of the moon. When Earth is between the sun and the moon, we can see the entire lit part of the moon. We call this the full moon."
Science,"But sometimes during a full moon, Earth, the moon, and the sun all line up in such a way that Earth casts a shadow onto the moon. This creates a lunar eclipse. Lunar eclipses can be seen from anywhere on the night side of Earth. The two most dramatic types of lunar eclipses are total and partial. During a total lunar eclipse, Earth's shadow completely covers the moon. This means that no direct sunlight is reaching the moon. However, the moon is still visible during the eclipse."
Science,"Why is this? As sunlight passes through our atmosphere, some of it gets bent slightly allowing it to reach the moon as indirect sunlight. Most of the light that gets bent is red or orange, meaning that the moon appears reddish orange during the eclipse. During a partial lunar eclipse, Earth's shadow only partially covers the moon. So some direct sunlight is still reaching the moon."
Science,"Lunar eclipses only happen during a full moon since it's the only time in the moon's orbit where Earth is between the sun and the moon. And you might be wondering, ""why isn't there a lunar eclipse during every full moon?"" Well, the moon's orbit around Earth is tilted relative to Earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the moon often passes just above or just below Earth's shadow."
Science,"Partial lunar eclipses happen when the sun, the moon, and Earth almost, but not quite exactly, line up so that the moon is only partially covered by Earth's shadow. Total lunar eclipses happen only when the sun, the moon, and Earth all line up precisely. So if you ever get to see a lunar eclipse, you can thank our planet for blocking the moon's sunlight and letting us enjoy the celestial spectacle.."
Science,"During a solar eclipse, the moon blocks the sun's light and energy from reaching part of earth. So how does a solar eclipse appear from earth? Well, if you're standing in the center of the moon's shadow, you'd see the moon appear to completely cover the sun's disk. This is called a total solar eclipse. There are other types of solar eclipses but we're going to focus on total solar eclipses in this video. During a total solar eclipse, the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere called its corona is visible."
Science,"On a non-solar eclipse day, the Corona is invisible to us because we can't see past the bright light from the sun's surface. Remember to never stare or look at the sun with your naked eye, binoculars or a telescope. Looking even for a few seconds can cause severe and permanent eye damage. Just because you can't look directly at the sun doesn't mean that you can't enjoy watching a solar eclipse, though."
Science,"You can watch the eclipse in action through a pinhole viewer or ultraviolet ray blocking solar eclipse glasses. If you're in the moon shadow during a total solar eclipse, you might also notice a drop in temperature. On average, the temperature drops about 5.5 degree Celsius during a total solar eclipse. This is because the moon block solar energy from reaching earth. Total solar eclipses last only a few minutes. This is because the moon is always revolving around earth."
Science,"As the moon keeps on moving, the sun starts to reappear around the moon and eventually the sun returns to its usual round and sunny self. But how is it even possible for the moon to appear to block the sun in the first place? The sun and the moon aren't the same size. In fact, the sun is so big that 64.3 million moons could fit inside of it. However, coincidentally, the sun is far enough away that the moon and the sun appear to us earthlings to be the same size in the sky."
Science,"So when the moon moves between the sun and earth during a total solar eclipse, it appears from earth to cover the disk of the sun almost exactly. Total solar eclipses like all solar eclipses happen only during a new moon which is the only time in the moon's orbit where the moon is located between the sun and earth. Solar eclipses don't happen every new moon though. Most of the time, the moon, earth and the sun are not lined up."
Science,This is because the plane of the moon's orbit around earth is at a different angle than the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the moon's shadow is usually too high or too low to hit earth and cause an eclipse. Total solar eclipses won't be visible from earth in about 600 million years. This is because the moon's orbit is gradually getting bigger with the moon moving about four centimeters away from earth each year.
Science,"So one day the moon will appear to be too small in the sky to entirely block the sun's light. Total solar eclipses take place on earth every 18 months or so, but sometimes they're only visible from the middle of an ocean or a desert. If you're curious about when the next total solar eclipse will happen near you look it up online. Scientists are able to calculate when solar eclipses will happen centuries in advance. So you can start planning far ahead."
Science,"Personally, I'll need to travel if I want to see a total solar eclipse anytime soon because the next one visible in my hometown is on September 14th, 2099.."
Science,"And the amount of water on Earth today, in lakes, rivers, oceans, glaciers, even under the ground and up in the clouds, it's about the same as it was millions and millions of years ago. That's because water is recycled. It just gets used again and again. And that brings us to the water cycle, which is how water continuously moves from the ground to the atmosphere and back again. And as water moves through the cycle, it changes form."
Science,"In fact, water is the only substance on Earth that naturally exists in three states, solid, liquid, and gas. Have you seen water in all of its different states? Maybe on a hot day, you'll add some ice, which is water in its solid state, to a glass of liquid water. Or maybe when you take out some food that you've heated in the microwave, you'll see steam coming off of the food, which is water in its gas state as water vapor. When you think of water, you might think of the wide open ocean."
Science,"Over 95% of all the water on Earth is in the ocean, so this is a great place to start with the water cycle. Here, energy from the sun warms up water on the surface of the ocean enough to turn it into water vapor. This is called evaporation. This water vapor is less dense, meaning it's lighter, than liquid water, so it rises up and up into the atmosphere. However, as the water vapor rises, the temperature in the atmosphere cools."
Science,"In turn, the water vapor condenses into tiny liquid water droplets, or, as we see them, clouds. This is called condensation. Air currents then move these clouds all around the Earth. As a cloud collects more and more liquid water droplets, the water may be released from the cloud, pulled down by gravity, and then return to the ocean or land as precipitation, like rain. If it's really cold, though, the water drops may crystallize and become snow."
Science,"The snow will fall to the ground and eventually melt back into a liquid and run off into a lake or river, pulled down by gravity, which flows back into the ocean where the whole process starts over again. But that's just one path water can take through the water cycle. It's like a choose your own adventure. Instead of snow melting and running off into a river, the snow could become part of an icy cold glacier and stay there for a long, long time, for thousands of years."
Science,"Or rain can seep into the ground and become groundwater, where it's then absorbed by plant roots. In turn, through transpiration, the water absorbed by the plants can transition to water vapor and leave directly through the leaves via tiny holes called stomata and return to the atmosphere. Or instead of being absorbed by plant roots, the groundwater can work its way to an underground aquifer or a lake, river, or even the ocean."
Science,"There are many different paths for water and the water cycle can be very complicated. But it really comes down to something very simple. The amount of water on Earth stays pretty constant over time and moves from place to place, sometimes transitioning between phases, depending on things like weather, geography, solar energy, and gravity. Now, we know that water is essential to life on Earth and fresh water is an especially limited resource for a growing world population."
Science,"Changes in the water cycle can impact everyone through the economy, energy production, health, recreation transportation, agriculture, and of course drinking water. And that's why understanding the water cycle is so important. That, and it's pretty cool to know that you drink the same water as dinosaurs did. Until next time.."
Science,"Weather can refer to humidity, or amount of water vapor in the air, temperature, air pressure, and, of course, precipitation like rain or snow. When heat from the sun enters Earth's lower atmosphere, it affects the temperature and humidity of the air. As this National Aeronautics and Space Administration map shows, air masses with certain characteristics tend to form in similar places."
Science,"There's many ways to classify these air masses, but to keep it simple, these blue blobs represent colder air masses, which tend to be closer to the poles, and the red blobs represent warm air masses, which are often found near the equator, where the sun's energy is strongest. The qualities of an air mass may also depend on where it forms. Air masses that form over land tend to have less humidity than those that form over an ocean. Air masses can even change characteristics as they move."
Science,"For example, when a very cold and dry air mass moves over the ocean, it will likely pick up warmth and moisture, transforming it into a slightly warmer and more humid air mass. Weather results from these air masses moving from areas with high air pressure to areas with low air pressure. When this happens, a high- or low-pressure system can form. A high-pressure system has higher pressure at its center than the areas around it, so air moves out from the center."
Science,"High-pressure systems typically bring clear skies. A low-pressure system has lower pressure at its center than the areas around it, so air is sucked into the center of the system. Low-pressure systems typically bring more intense weather. Why is this? Well, low-pressure systems are often associated with what we call fronts. A front is a boundary that forms when air masses of different temperatures collide near Earth's surface. Different types of fronts can then form depending on how those air masses meet."
Science,"A warm front occurs when a warm air mass moves in to a replace a cold air mass. Since warm air is less dense than cold air, it rises above the colder air, causing a lot of overcast skies, moderate rain or snow, and warm temperatures. A cold front occurs when a cold air mass moves in to replace a warm air mass. The dense cold air pushes the warmer air mass upward, causing larger clouds to build overhead and bringing heavy rain or thunderstorms, strong winds, and cool temperatures with them."
Science,"Weather is so complex that it can be difficult to predict what will happen next. Luckily, scientists have developed technologies that help model weather patterns so we can all make more informed choices about what to expect when we go outside. To do that, they set up tools like satellites and Doppler radar to observe atmospheric conditions such as wind speed, temperature, air pressure, and nearby geographic features."
Science,"They can input the data they record into computer models, which can use that information to predict future weather. Have you ever seen a map like this used in a weather forecast? This National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map uses data from a Doppler radar station that measured the progression of a severe storm over the Northeastern United States. The most intense central parts of the storm are shown in red, with colors down the rainbow representing progressively less intense parts of the storm."
Science,"As technology has advanced, these weather reports have gotten more accurate, but with so many factors to consider weather is still only somewhat predictable. That's why you'll always hear probabilistic weather predictions, providing a percentage that refers to how confident the model is that the prediction will happen. If your local weather forecast says there's a 30% chance of rain, it's less likely, but still possible that you're going to get rain."
Science,"If it says there's a 90% chance of snow on another day, you're most likely going to get snow. Even if weather predictions aren't perfect, it's amazing that scientists figured out how to understand such a complicated phenomenon. Without modern tools and models, it would be much more difficult for us to plan ahead and be prepared for possible weather hazards. Next time you have a fancy day out planned, be sure to check the weather forecast before you go."
Science,"If it says there's a decent chance of rain, don't forget your umbrella.."
Science,"The Sun actually heats Earth unevenly. We know that it's hotter near the equator and it gets colder as you go towards the poles. Near the equator, the Sun's rays hit Earth surface more directly, while near the poles, the Sun's rays hit Earth surface less directly. In both regions, the same amount of solar energy is heading Earth, but near the equator, this energy is concentrated into a smaller area and near the poles it's spread out over a larger area."
Science,"So the regions near the equator get more solar energy, which makes them warmer and the regions near the poles get less solar energy, which makes them cooler. This uneven heating at Earth also affects air pressure, where it's cooler near the poles, cool air will sink making the air pressure high, but where it's warmer near the equator, warm air will rise resulting in low pressure. This is where the terms low-pressure cells and high-pressure cells come from."
Science,"The low-pressure warmer air at the equator rises into the upper atmosphere where it cools and flows away towards higher latitudes away from the equator. Because the air is now cooler, it starts to sink again and creates a high-pressure band near these latitudes. This process repeats and creates a pattern of high and low-pressure bands from the equator to the poles. We know that air flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. This creates air occurrence or winds."
Science,"Now you might think that these winds would blow in straight lines from high to low-pressure areas. But the global wind patterns, which we call prevailing winds, look like they curved the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This curving has to do with the rotation of Earth and is called the Coriolis effect."
Science,"As these prevailing winds blow across the surface of the land and water, they also pushed against the surface of the ocean and produce wind-driven surface currents, which helped to move ocean water. Here's what the global pattern of ocean surface currents looks like. Like wind currents, ocean surface currents are also curved due to the Coriolis effect."
Science,"We can see that in these currents that are traveling north and south, which curved to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Together as these surface currents of the ocean connect, they formed giant rotating systems of ocean currents called gyres. The currents that drive these gyres extend from the surface to about one kilometer down into the ocean and helped move water all around the globe."
Science,"But these gyres aren't just moving water, they're moving heat energy as well. Water is pretty good at holding onto heat it absorbs from the Sun. So as the water in our oceans moves around the world through this gyre circulation, the water also carries heat. Here, warm water generally moves from the equator to the poles and cold water moves from the poles to the equator. But the ocean has other deeper currents that are affected by differences in temperature and density."
Science,"Remember how we talked about areas heated directly and less directly by the Sun? And how that results in low and high-pressure areas? Same thing with water, except that water density is affected by both temperature and salinity, which is a measure of how salty the ocean is. Cooler and saltier water is more dense, so it tends to sink, just like cool air. Whereas warmer and less salty water is less dense and tends to rise, just like warm air."
Science,"So with these deeper ocean currents, water actually moves vertically or up and down. For example, water near the poles gets very cold. It also gets very salty, because when sea ice is formed, the salt can't go into the ice. Instead, the salt stays behind in the water and so the water gets saltier or more saline. Together, the coldness and salinity makes the water very dense causing it to sink deep into the ocean."
Science,"And other parts of the ocean, wind drags deep water up to the surface and a process called upwelling. These vertical currents are connected by horizontal currents at the surface and in the deep ocean. Collectively, this system of currents is known as the overturning circulation. You might also hear it called the global ocean conveyor belts. So here's a map showing the overturning circulation. This map might look a little bit strange, but here we're looking at Earth from the South Pole."
Science,"So Australia and the southern tips of Africa and South America are closes to the center of the map, while Europe, most of Asia and North America are at the edges. Now, if you follow the currents in the overturning circulation, you can see that they flow all over the world's oceans. From the southern ocean around the South Pole, to the Pacific, the Indian and all the way into the North Atlantic."
Science,"Like the currents in the gyre circulation, the currents in the overturning circulation also carry and disperse heat energy all around the world. Here I am, back in my favorite river, waiting around and enjoying currents of cool water flowing around my feet. And even though this river is small, the currents that flow through it are similar to the global wind and ocean currents that flow all around the world. So these currents connect in our atmosphere and oceans, which means that we are all connected."
Science,So currents connect us all..
Science,"Climate is the long term pattern of weather in a particular region. You can think of it as the average weather. A region's climate depends on many factors, including its latitude, elevation, and surrounding geographic features, such as oceans or mountains. Let's look at how regional climates depend on latitude first. Latitude refers to imaginary lines that measure how far north or south a place is from the Equator, which equally divides the earth in half."
Science,"The Equator is marked at zero degrees latitude and the mid-latitudes increase north or south until they reach the poles, which are marked at 90 degrees north and 90 degrees south. The sun heats the planet unevenly. So places at higher latitudes, which are farther from the Equator, get less direct sunlight and solar energy on average, resulting in lower average annual temperatures."
Science,"Places at lower latitudes, being closer to the Equator, get more direct sunlight and solar energy on average, which results in higher average annual temperatures. This uneven heating creates a pattern of low and high air pressure bands from the Equator to the poles, affecting the amount of precipitation that the different latitudes receive. In bands where moist air is rising, mainly at zero degrees latitude and 60 degrees north and south, places experience a lot of rainfall, especially around the Equator."
Science,"And bands where dry air is sinking, like at the poles and 30 degrees north and south, places experience very little rainfall. This creates dry conditions at the cold poles and desert conditions in regions near the 30 degree latitude lines. Another important influence on regional climates is elevation or how high a place is above sea level. As air rises from lower to higher elevations, it expands and cools."
Science,"That's why regions at higher elevations, like mountains, tend to have lower average air temperatures than regions at lower elevations. Speaking of mountains and seas, the presence of geographic features can also influence a region's climate. Let's start by diving into the impact of water first. Water heats and cools slowly while land heats and cools quickly. As a result, temperature variations tend to be much smaller for cities near large bodies of water than for cities surrounded by land."
Science,"For example, let's compare the yearly temperature ranges for Vancouver, which is close to Canada's Pacific Coast and Winnipeg, which is further East in the interior of the country. This line graph follows the average temperature in Celsius for each city throughout the months of the year. Vancouver starts at the year mildly chilly. Temperatures rise a bit for a warmer summer. And then slope gradually back down."
Science,"Overall, the city sees a pretty small range of temperatures throughout the year because the nearby ocean influences the local climate as it gradually warms and cools. Compared to Vancouver, Winnipeg has a much colder winter and a slightly hotter summer resulting in a more dramatic range of temperatures throughout the year. We call a climate like Vancouver's a Marine Climate and a climate like Winnipeg's a Continental Climate."
Science,"Things get pretty interesting when we combine the impact of water with land forms. One unique example is a rain shadow, which can be found in places where mountains are relatively close to the ocean. For example, here's a satellite image of the Andes Mountain Range in south America. The mountains run north to south in this image and they're close to the Pacific Ocean. Notice how the area between the Pacific and the Andes is green and lush, but the area behind the Andes is brown and dry."
Science,"That's the rain shadow. What causes such a huge change? Well, when warm moisture rich air from the ocean meets the mountain it's forced upward. As it rises the air expands and cools causing the moisture to condense and fall as precipitation. Now, the air is much drier, which allows it to change temperature much faster. As that dry air descends down the other side of the mountain it compresses and quickly becomes warmer, which leads to increased evaporation."
Science,"Overall, this results in a cool and wet climate on the ocean side of the mountain and a warm and dry climate inside the rain shadow, which is what we saw on the satellite view. As you can see, regional climates can get pretty complicated when you consider all of the factors that can go into them. Depending on the exact region, one factor may be more responsible for the local climate than the others. Like how the presence of the Andes Mountains contributes to the rain shadow climate beyond them."
Science,"Let's look back at our two very different cities from before so we can see how the factors we discussed affect their winter climates. Fairbanks is at a very high northern latitude which helps explain why it's so freezing in the winter. Miami is much closer to the Equator and near an ocean, so it experiences a very warm and mild winter."
Science,"Which of these cities would you like to visit in the winter? Whether you prefer hanging out on sunny shorelines or exploring frosty winter wonderlands, there's a regional climate somewhere in the world that you'd probably enjoy.."
Science,"And sometimes they change slowly, like when a rock is heated and compressed in the earth for thousands to millions of years. When geologists stare at a rock, they can figure out the rocks composition and tell the story of how it was created. And it turns out rocks can be made in many different ways. When put it the right combination of heat and pressure, rocks can become molten and liquid. When this molten rock cools and becomes solid, we call the rock it makes igneous rock."
Science,"This term comes from the Latin word igneus, which means fiery or burning hot. Igneous rocks make up more than 90% of the Earth's crust. One common kind of igneous rock is granite, which you've probably seen in bridges, buildings, and countertops. Another kind of igneous rock is obsidian, which is smooth and glassy, and is sometimes used to make knife weights. Both of these rocks were made of molten rock."
Science,"So why do they look so different? Well, granite was made from magma, which is molten rock that exists below the surface of the earth. Magma tends to cool slowly underground, which gives time for the elements in it to form large crystals. And this obsidian rock was made from lava, which is molten rock that flows above the ground. Lava tends to cool quickly, which causes the rocks it forms like obsidian, tuff smaller crystals. I always remember the difference between magma and lava like this."
Science,"I keep my lava lamp above the ground, just like lava is above the ground. If I buried my lava lamp in the ground, then I can call it a magma lamp. Once an igneous rock is created, its journey isn't over. The rock might begin to change through a process called weathering. This is when water, weather, wind, and other physical forces chip away at a rock and cause little pieces to break off. These little particles are called sediments. The sediment from our igneous rock can be moved around by wind and water."
Science,"This is called erosion. Eventually, the sediment will settle down somewhere. Maybe at the bottom of an ocean or a lake, and it might join other sediment from other rocks, crushed up shells, and plant matter. And over time, this sediment will become a rock. Rocks that are formed from sediments are called, you guessed it, sedimentary rocks. But how does sedimentary goop at the bottom of the lake become a rock? Well, it goes through a process called lithification. Lith comes from the Greek word for stone."
Science,"So you can think of this process as stonification. The first step of lithification is called deposition. This is when sediment is deposited in a new location and it spreads out to form a layer. As more and more layers are created, the layers underneath them become squished together. This is called compaction. When water moves to the layers of sediment, it can carry dissolve minerals with it. The water can leave these minerals in between the sediment particles, which makes everything stick together."
Science,"This cementing of sediment is called cementation. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is made with sediment that contains a lot of calcium carbonate in it goes through lithification. But once the sedimentary rock has been created, it doesn't mean that it is done changing. Sometimes a rock is squeezed or heated so much that the minerals inside it actually change composition. It is now a metamorphic rock."
Science,"You might've heard of the word metamorphosis, which describes when something changes from one form and structure to another. Like when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly. Metamorphic rocks are made when igneous, sedimentary, or even other metamorphic rocks change form and structure because of heat and pressure. For example, when the sedimentary rock, limestone, gets put under a lot of heat and pressure, it can turn into marble, but metamorphic rocks still may not be done changing."
Science,Rocks can actually keep on changing forever. Igneous and metamorphic rocks can become sedimentary rocks if they're broken apart into sediments and go through lithification. And metamorphic rocks and sedimentary rocks can become igneous rocks when they are melted and then cools. And igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks can become metamorphic rocks when they're exposed to high heat and pressure. This is called the rock cycle. So maybe next time you get the chance to stare at a rock.
Science,"See if you can figure out whether it's igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary. And when rocks changed so much, who knows what kind of rock it'll be next.."
Science,"And you may be wondering, ""How can we map out what happened on Earth billions of years ago?"" The answer is rocks. Geologists look for clues in sedimentary rock layers, which we call strata. The fossil record, which are the remains of organisms that have been preserved in rock layers can give us glimpses of creatures that breathe long ago. Also, the difference in mineral composition in different rock layers can tell geologists when a volcano erupted or an asteroid hit."
Science,"But how did geologists know when one rock layer is older than another? Well, when sedimentary rocks form, they're deposited in layers, one on top of the other. So unless the layers are disturbed or turned over, the layers at the bottom are always older than the layers at the top. Geologists call this rule the Law of Superposition. So if a geologist finds a fossil of an ammonite in a layer of rock above a fossil of a Dunkleosteus, the scientists would know that the Dunkleosteus is older than the ammonite."
Science,"This process is called relative dating because it helps scientists determine the relative ages of rock layers and fossils. But what does relative ages mean? Let's say that I told you my friend Ava is younger than her sister, but older than her cat. Then, I wouldn't be telling you Ava's exact age, but her relative age in relation to her sister and her cat. Let's take a look at another example of relative ages, this time, with rocks. Imagine that one day you found a big rock with many layers like this."
Science,"Because the rock is a sedimentary rock and you remember the Law of Superposition, you know that the layers at the bottom are older and you know that the layers up here are younger. But what about this section of rock right here that slices through the other layers? Geologists would call this section an igneous intrusion since it was formed for molten rock that has cooled. This particular igneous intrusion isn't clearly on top of or below any of the sedimentary rock layers."
Science,"So we can't use the Law of Superposition here. Luckily, geologists have figured out another rule called the law of crosscutting relationships. This rule says that when two geologic features cross or intersect, the feature that cuts through the other is younger, and this makes sense because you can't break something before it even exists. So since our igneous intrusion cuts through the layers of the sedimentary rock, we know that it must be even younger than the rock layers."
Science,"And what about this fault or break over here? Well, since it slice through all the layers, as well as the igneous rock, the law of crosscutting relationships tells us that the faults must be the very youngest geologic feature here. Other pieces of evidence, like fossils, could be used for relative dating. For example, suppose a geologist found a rock containing fossils of extinct organisms and another rock that contained fossils of modern organisms."
Science,"The geologist could then deduce that the rock with the extinct organisms is older. Certain kinds of fossils, called index fossils, are especially helpful when determining the relative age of a rock. Index fossils are fossils that are only found on a specific section of the geologic timescale. I always remember what an index fossil is like this. Just like I use my index finger to point to give directions, index fossils can point to when on the geologic timescale a rock was formed."
Science,"So if a geologist finds the same index fossil in rock layers in two different rocks, they know that those rock layers must have been formed around the same time period, but fossils aren't the only thing that can help geologists figure out a rock's relative age. For example, if a geologist found two rock layers that contained evidence of the same geologic event, like a layer of ash from a major volcanic eruption, the geologists could deduce that those rock layers were made at the same time."
Science,"Relative dating is how geologists figured out that Stegosauruses were extinct long before T-Rex's even existed. It also helped them figure out the first single cellular life formed about 3.8 billion years ago and the first multicellular life formed about 600 million years ago, and they figured out that modern humans didn't even exist until about 200,000 years ago, which is right at the very end of the geologic time scale."
Science,"In other words, it took a really, really long time for life to evolve into what it looks like today. We, humans, are very young in the grand scheme of the Earth's history. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go saddle and ride this Brontosaurus. Let's go, ginger snap!."
Science,"But there's another kind of movement that happens slowly in the rock beneath your feet. Earth's lithosphere, which is made up of the crust and the upper part of the mantle, is broken up into pieces called tectonic plates. These plates move around on top of the asthenosphere, which is the section of the mantle just below the lithosphere. Don't bother racing a tectonic plate, because your victory would be guaranteed."
Science,"Tectonic plates typically only move a few centimeters in a year, which is about as fast as your fingernails grow. However, after millions of years, those distances add up. This means that the Earth hasn't always looked the way it does now. Scientists believe that the continents were once all connected in one big supercontinent called Pangea. Just imagine if the continents were still connected today. You could drive from Africa to Antarctica or even take a train from South America to Europe."
Science,"Over 200 million years, Pangea broke apart, and the pieces drifted into the continents we know today. So if the plates move so slowly, how do we know that they move at all? Scientists have documented evidence from various features on Earth that support the theory of plate tectonics. If you cut out the continents on a map, you could see that they almost fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. For example, the east coast of South America looks like it could fit into the west coast of Africa."
Science,"Matching or complementary coastlines is one piece of evidence that continents were once in different locations. Another piece of evidence is that scientists have found fossils from the same species on different continents. There's no way those land organisms could've traveled across the ocean. This suggests that the animals lived when the continents were connected. And the plates are still moving, slowly but surely, to this day. But they aren't all moving in the same direction."
Science,"A plate can collide with one plate, move away from a different plate, and slide past another. We categorize the ways plates interact at their edges as having convergent, divergent, or transform boundaries. Con is a Latin prefix meaning together, so convergent plate boundaries are places where two plates come together. Let's take a look at an example of a convergent boundary where the Indian tectonic plate collides with the Eurasian plate."
Science,"The crust of the plate becomes compressed, and the Indian tectonic plate gradually moves under the Eurasian plate. However, the lower density of the crust keeps the Indian plate from sinking back into the asthenosphere all the way. This lifts up the Eurasian plate and creates the Himalayan mountains. These mountains are some of the highest in the world, and they include Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain above sea level. And the two plates are still colliding."
Science,"This causes the Himalayas to grow by more than one centimeter each year. Another kind of plate movement is called a divergent boundary. The di in divergent comes from a Latin prefix meaning apart, so divergent boundaries happen where two tectonic plates move apart. Divergent boundaries can create different kinds of land forms, like rift valleys and mid-ocean ridges. The third kind of plate boundary is called a transform boundary or transform fault, and it happens when two plates slide past each other."
Science,"Okay, maybe slide isn't the best word for it, because the plates don't move in one continuous motion. You can imagine when two incredibly large, bulky, rocky things move past each other, there's a lot of friction. Pressure builds up between the plates, and once it gets to be too much, the plates slip and release the pressure. This motion causes earthquakes. And you might be wondering, what causes plates to move? Well, scientists are always learning about the Earth, since the Earth is so complex."
Science,"Although Earth's internal heat may play a small role, more evidence shows that gravity is key. Tectonic plates are solid, and they're denser and cooler than the asthenosphere. Because the asthenosphere is also pretty solid, the plates rest on top of it. However, the asthenosphere is so hot that it can behave a bit like clay. This means that at convergent boundaries, the edges of the plates can sink into the asthenosphere, a process that is driven by gravity."
Science,"So even though you'd win in a race against a tectonic plate, the plate will still keep on moving millions of years after you've declared yourself to be the winner.."
Science,"You'd see gaping trenches running deep into the ground, and mountains taller than any mountain on the continents. And you might wonder, what causes such dramatic landscapes to be formed? Earth's lithosphere, which is made up of the crust and the upper part of the mantle, is broken up into large puzzle piece like chunks called tectonic plates. These tectonic plates move around slowly over millions of years on the section of the mantle below the lithosphere, which we call the asthenosphere."
Science,"There are two types of tectonic plates, oceanic plates and continental plates. The continental plates, as you probably guessed, are the ones that make up the continents. The oceanic plates are the ones that make up the sea floor. The main difference between oceanic plates and continental plates is the type of crust found on each plate. Oceanic crust and continental crust are made out of different kinds of rock. The continental crust contains a lot of granite, which is an igneous rock."
Science,"This means that it was made out of rock that was once molten. The oceanic crust has a lot of basalt in it, which is another kind of igneous rock. The difference in the kinds of rock that the crusts are made out of means that the oceanic crust is denser than the continental crust. If you took a cubic centimeter of the rock from the continental crust, it would be about 2.7 grams. A cubic centimeter from the oceanic crust, on the other hand, would weigh about three grams."
Science,"While this difference in density might not seem like much, it completely changes how tectonic plates interact. The high density of oceanic crust causes oceanic plates to sink into the asthenosphere a bit more than continental plates do. When an oceanic plate collides with another plate at a convergent boundary, it always follows this rule, the denser plates always dives beneath the less dense plate."
Science,"When it's an oceanic plates and a continental plate converging, the denser oceanic plates is the one that dips down. And when it's two oceanic plates that are colliding, the older, denser oceanic plate will move under the newer and less dense oceanic plates. And over time, the denser plate will be recycled into asthenosphere. The place where the plates collide is called a subduction zone. This bending of the denser plates under the other creates a trench."
Science,"The deepest one is the Mariana Trench, which is located where the Pacific plates dives under the Marianna plates. The trench is about 11 kilometers deep. The plate that sinks into asthenosphere often has some water and fluids trapped inside of it. These fluids heat up and bubble to the surface. The hot fluids can cause sections of mantle rock to melt into magma, which then rises to the surface and creates volcanoes."
Science,"And you might be wondering, if the sea floor is constantly being destroyed then what keeps the earth from shrinking? Well, new sea floor is constantly being created too. This happens when two tectonic plates move away from each other at a divergent boundary. When two plates diverge in the middle of an ocean, it creates a kind of underwater mountain range called a mid-ocean ridge. As the plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges, magma moves up, cools and forms a new younger lithosphere."
Science,"You can think of this process like a really slow conveyor belt. New ocean sea floor is made at the ridges, and moves away from them over millions of years. This means that the oceanic crust that is closest to the ridge is the youngest. And as it moves away from the ridge, the crust gets older and older. As it ages, the crust becomes cooler and more dense. And eventually it dips back down into the asthenosphere at the trenches. The sea floor is perhaps the most unexplored part of our planet."
Science,"So if they do drain the ocean and you go for a walk at the bottom of the sea, I hope you'll tell us all what it's like down there.."
Science,"Water made this canyon and water forms many landscapes, including valleys, ravines, cliffs, coastlines, all of these were largely shaped and affected by water. And given that water covers most of the earth, or over 70% of it, it's no surprise that water also shapes the earth. Water is a powerful force. It can literally wash away soil and carve away rock bit by bit, which scientists describe through two separate processes. When water breaks rocks apart, it's called weathering."
Science,"And when water carries away surface soil, sediments, and that broken down rock it's called erosion. Erosion by water starts with rain. During a rain storm the impact of raindrops is actually powerful enough to dislodge soil particles and damage soil structure. This is called mechanical weathering. As rainwater starts to accumulate, it can erode a landscape by moving soil and rock particles, called sediment, away from their original location."
Science,"And as water flows down the slope of hills and mountains, it transports sediment along with it. Eventually water gathers into small streams and then rivers, carrying more and more sediment. In fact, through erosion, water carries away billions of tons of sediment to the oceans every year. Plant roots and vegetation can hold soil in place and prevent or slow soil erosion. But if soil has nothing to hold it down, water can erode away soil very quickly."
Science,"As the volume of water increases, so does its power of erosion. In turn, a large river can erode more soil and rock quicker than a small river can. The speed of the water flow also affects its erosional power. Simply put, faster moving water can carry more sediment. This relationship is one reason why fast moving water causes more erosion than the same volume of slow moving water. A great example of water erosion in relation to speed is that of meandering rivers and Oxbow lakes."
Science,"You know, the weird horseshoe looking lake in this image. Let's take a look at how these Oxbow lakes form. The current of the water is fastest on the outside of the bend. In turn, these are the areas where water tends to erode away the river bank. Conversely, the current of the water is slowest on the inside of a bend. Here, the water slows down so much that some of the sediment that is being carried is dropped, or deposited. This is called sedimentation."
Science,"Over time, through erosion and deposition, an Oxbow lake will form, which is eventually cut off from the river. Chemical weathering as another way that water can break rocks, such as when acids in water dissolve certain types of rocks and minerals. Over time, flowing water can dissolve the minerals and rocks on or under the surface. This chemical weathering can cause sinkholes, caves, and cliffs to form. Certain rocks like limestone are especially vulnerable to erosion."
Science,"In particular, limestone easily erodes due to carbonic acid and rainwater, which forms when carbon dioxide, or CO2, from the atmosphere dissolves in water. In turn limestone erosion can produce intricate cave systems. Along beaches and the ocean front, coastal erosion breaks up and wears away rock. As waves sweep in over and over, they cause rock to weather away and break off. Going back to the Snake River and Swan Falls, I can see examples of weathering and erosion all around me."
Science,"I look to the cliffs which have been slowly carved away by the Snake River over time to reveal this amazing valley, which was formed by weathering and water erosion. Water erosion is incredibly powerful and although it can be destructive by removing soil and rock over thousands and thousands of years, water erosion is also responsible for creating the beautiful and spectacular landscapes that we enjoy today.."
Science,"All of this is possible because of the natural resources that surround us wherever we go. A natural resource is anything found in nature that can be used by people. Natural resources can be renewable, meaning they can be replenished over a human lifetime, or non-renewable, meaning they can take far longer to be replaced. Both kinds of resources are unevenly distributed across Earth."
Science,"This makes sense for non-renewable resources, right? These resources are formed by geologic processes, such as plate tectonics that take place in specific locations on Earth. As a result, non-renewable resources like soil, minerals, and fossil fuels are often concentrated in the places where they first formed. Let's take a look at one type of non-renewable resource, metal ore."
Science,"Metal ores are rocks that contain valuable metals that people can extract, and they're often found in large accumulations called deposits. For example, most copper ore is found in what are called porphyry copper deposits. Porphyry just means that the rock that makes up these deposits contains a mix of large and small crystals, like in this image here. Porphyry copper deposits form in subduction zones along convergent tectonic plate boundaries."
Science,"Today, most subduction zones are found along Pacific coastlines, so you can expect to find a lot of porphyry copper mines in these places. However, we also find many of these ore deposits throughout Eurasia and Australia. Why? Turns out many of these places were subduction zones in the ancient past. The geologic processes that form non-renewable resources are always happening, even if they occur over thousands or millions of years."
Science,"This means that non-renewable resources are not always found where they first formed. Porphyry copper deposits follow the same, slow life cycle as many other metal ores, forming in magma chambers below the crust, then uplifting towards the surface through tectonic activity. Once exposed to the elements, the deposits can experience weathering and erosion, which allows them to gradually recycle back into the earth, unless people find and mine them first."
Science,"How can renewable natural resources be unevenly distributed across Earth though? Doesn't everywhere have things like sunlight and wind? Well, yes, but Earth's tilt means that some places experience more direct sunlight throughout the year than others. And geography and other factors mean that some places are windier than others. For example, take a look at this map of average annual wind speeds across the contiguous United States."
Science,"These purple, red, and orange places typically experience higher wind speeds, while these green and yellow places typically experience lower wind speeds. As a result, this central part of the country here has a much higher capacity for producing wind energy, so more people have invested in wind turbine technologies in these places. We can see that in this second map, which shows the distribution of wind power plants across the same area."
Science,"Notice how most of the country's wind power plants are concentrated around the places where people recorded the highest wind speeds. The distribution of certain natural resources can also be impacted by human activities. After all, we typically need to harvest and move natural resources to use them. Think about fossil fuels, like coal and oil. Humans extract these raw materials from Earth's crust using mining or drilling wells and then transport them all over the world to refine into usable products."
Science,"Once fossil fuels are removed from the ground, it can take millions of years for Earth to replace them. So every time we use these non-renewable resources, we have less available for future use. People can seek out new deposits, but they run the risk of finding lower-quality materials or sites that are more challenging to extract resources from. Even renewable resources can be affected by human actions. Take fresh water, for example."
Science,"People may redistribute fresh water on the surface by building dams across rivers or other waterways. Dams store water for communities to use, and some even act as renewable hydropower generators, converting the kinetic energy of running water into electricity. However, by changing the natural flow of the water, dams can reduce the amount of water available to communities and ecosystems further downstream. People may also redistribute freshwater by pumping it up from underground."
Science,"Groundwater can consistently provide freshwater in places where other sources are scarce, but if communities draw that groundwater up faster than the water cycle can replenish it, it can dry up. Naturally, unequal distribution of resources already makes life difficult for some places. And without careful management, human activities can make these disparities even worse."
Science,"However, if we work together to avoid overexploiting the resources our planet naturally provides, whether they can renew themselves or not, we can all continue to thrive no matter where we live.."
Science,"Though it hasn't erupted in over a century, it has the potential to do so again, something that it would have been nice to know more than a week before I left for my vacation. Volcanoes are one of the most dramatic examples of a natural hazard, a naturally occurring phenomenon that can pose risks to humans and society. Natural hazards can be very dangerous for our communities."
Science,"But scientists can help people better understand the risks that may occur where they live so everyone can work together to prepare safety guidelines. Different places experience different natural hazards due to local geographic or atmospheric conditions. For example, a storm on open plains could spawn a tornado. Similarly, a storm over the ocean could grow into a hurricane or a cyclone by the time it reaches the coast."
Science,"These coastal rainstorms, along with their colder counterparts, blizzards, are the main natural hazards that I may run into where I live in the mid-Atlantic. Too much rain or snow can be dangerous, of course, but scientists have gotten pretty good at predicting weather conditions. Meteorologists use all kinds of technologies to map where and when a storm may form. Orbiting satellites can take pictures of cloud patterns from above."
Science,Weather stations back on the surface can use electromagnetic wave fields measured through Doppler radar to determine how heavy rain is falling or how strong the wind is blowing in those same clouds. They feed all of this and other data into computer models that can help them predict if the storm is severe enough to become a natural hazard.
Science,"For example, this map from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center shows where people can expect rainstorms, where others can expect snowstorms, and where those storms may become powerful enough to pose risks. Despite great advances in our ability to predict natural hazards, there are some phenomena that are less predictable, which can make them harder to prepare for. You see, the outer part of Earth is made up of large moving pieces called tectonic plates."
Science,"These plates can grind or slip against each other, releasing energy in the form of seismic waves. Most of the time, we don't even notice these tectonic movements. But especially along boundaries or fault lines in the plates, people may experience the ground-shaking tremors of earthquakes. Earthquakes can be especially dangerous in highly populated areas where they damage buildings, roads, and other forms of human infrastructure."
Science,"Earthquakes are often associated with volcanic activity, since volcanoes are often found near boundaries and fault lines of the tectonic plates. As the plates move and magma swells up to the surface, volcanic eruptions can release everything from clouds of gas or ash to rivers of molten lava. An earthquake in one location may even agitate large bodies of water enough to generate a tsunami, a huge and powerful wave, along the coastline in another."
Science,"Tsunamis can affect the local region as well as regions far away. Scientists can't predict an intense earthquake, volcanic eruption, or tsunami as effectively as they can a severe weather event. But they are working to better understand Earth's seismic activity and when it poses a risk. For example, they use tools like seismographs to determine when an earthquake is happening and its strength or magnitude."
Science,"Data from both minor and major tremors may help scientists figure out the signs that an earthquake is coming, giving communities along fault lines an early warning to evacuate or brace themselves, rather than simply reacting to the aftermath. Engineers can even use the data they've recorded from past earthquakes to design buildings and other structures to withstand the effects of future ones."
Science,"Communicating what they've learned may help places that experience seismic natural hazards to prepare far in advance, further reducing the risks that they face. Natural hazards can cause a lot of harm. But scientists are learning more every day about why they occur and how communities can remain resilient. For my trip, I studied up on visiting a volcano zone and was relieved to find that there's been no signs that Mount Rainier's erupting any time soon."
Science,"The whole experience really reinforced the importance of being prepared. Even if natural hazards aren't common where you live or travel, having a preparedness plan can help you stay safe in a scary situation. These are just some examples of how scientific research benefits society. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be setting up an emergency kit for the next time I lose power during a storm.."
Science,"If you throw an empty can on the ground instead of in the recycling bin, your local park will still be pretty clean. Those actions can add up though. What if everyone you know decides to start throwing their trash on the ground too? Or a nearby factory decides to dump all of their trash there? As the human population of Earth grows, we tend to consume and throw away more and more natural resources."
Science,"This trash bile is a simple example of pollution, which can also refer to toxic particles in our air or waterways. Human activities are also contributing to more complex problems, like overfishing or deforestation, which can drive wildlife to extinction and disrupt the natural processes that keep our planet running smoothly. Let's take a look at a real place that's facing some of these complex environmental problems."
Science,"This is Lake Urmia in Iran, once the largest lake in the Middle East and the sixth largest saltwater lake on Earth. The lake was a popular destination for people who wanted to visit its uniquely salty shores, as well as for migratory birds, like flamingos and pelicans, who had stopped to rest during their long journeys. This satellite image of Lake Urmia is from 1984. Now, compare it to another image taken in 2018. In just a few decades, the lake has shrunk dramatically."
Science,"What happened? Well, around the 1980s, Iran needed to create new jobs and sources of food for its growing population. More people began moving near Lake Urmia, converting large portions of the landscape into agricultural fields. They tried growing profitable new crops like apples, watermelon, and sugar beets, but many of these plants require a lot more water than the dry climate could provide."
Science,"So people built dams across many of the rivers that float into the region so they could more easily transport fresh water to their fields and communities. Iran has always experienced droughts, but with people using up so much water, the impact of these droughts became much worse. Lake Urmia began to shrink. The remaining water became so salty that many aquatic fish and other small critters couldn't survive, leaving migratory birds and other wildlife without a source of food."
Science,"Sandstorms blew salt from the dry lake bed over agricultural fields, making it even harder for people to grow food during droughts. Farmers were forced to move away, and many others from the tourist towns followed since few wanted to visit a vanishing lake where people could get sick from breathing the salty air. At one point, lake Imia lost nearly 90% of its historical volume, and many of its once thriving communities turned into ghost towns."
Science,"There's no question that human activities, from unsustainable farming practices to diverting water flow, cause this environmental catastrophe. Human activities aren't always negative though. We can work together to design technologies that monitor and minimize our harmful impacts. Since environmental problems are often so complex, we need to consider a lot of different things to create sustainable solutions."
Science,"What does scientific research tell us about this place and how it's changing? What are the needs, desires, and values of the people affected by this problem, both as individuals and as a society? Are there any constraints or challenges that could prevent us from taking action? Despite economic and political constraints, many Iranians support efforts to save Lake Urmia, which has encouraged leaders to provide more funding and other restoration resources."
Science,"Key parts of the ecosystem are now protected by reserves or national parks. Researchers have introduced new farming practices to the region, such as planting less thirsty pomegranate trees or watering crops at night to prevent evaporation. This has allowed farmers to save water while still producing enough food. Finally, engineers have been building new technologies that transfer water from surrounding areas into the lake."
Science,"Even with all of these changes, the problems plaguing Lake Urmia aren't completely fixed yet. Wildlife habitats still need to be restored so aquatic species can survive and migratory birds can fuel up for their long journeys. Water levels are still too low to attract many tourists. And salt from the exposed lake bed can still harm people's health when kicked up during sandstorms. People are worried that transferring water into Lake Urmia from nearby regions may cause even more widespread water shortages."
Science,"Their needs and concerns need to be addressed for decisions to work properly in the long term. While there's still plenty left to do, these efforts, combined with a few good rain years, have allowed Lake Urmia to return to about half of its historical size. Check out this Google Earth image from 2022. It's not back to the way it was, but it's looking a bit better. Lake Urmia isn't the only lake on Earth that's under threat from human activities."
Science,"For example, the Great Salt Lake in the United States is also shrinking for very similar reasons. Shared challenges can provide opportunities for people to share solutions. People can learn from what others are doing to fix similar problems or even brainstorm new ideas. For example, researchers from Iran and the United States have started working together to compare conservation activities on both of their salt lakes even though they're half a world apart."
Science,"While human action often has a negative impact on the planet, we have the power to spark positive change too. If you feel like your actions alone are too small to make a difference against a big problem, whether it's a shrinking lake or a giant pile of garbage in your neighborhood, there's usually a few other concerned citizens that would be happy to help find a solution.."
Science,"We know about all of these ancient climate trends because scientists learned how to estimate them using evidence from ice cores, tree rings, and other natural phenomena. We now know that for most of human history, people could expect a pattern that looks something like this graph from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration which shows how temperatures changed each year in comparison to this line, which represents the average global annual temperature from 1880 to 1899."
Science,"When we look at the time period between 1880 and 1940, we can see that some years temperatures would be higher than this average, some years they would be lower, but they generally swing back to a pretty comfortable state. Around the 1950s, though, the global average temperature began to climb to unprecedented levels. Our ancient temperature records never showed such a sudden increase."
Science,"When we look at the time period from 1950 to today, we can see that while temperatures still swing back down some years, these colder years are still much hotter than the average temperatures in the past. Researchers noticed a change in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun in our atmosphere, similar to how a greenhouse allows sunlight to pass through its glass walls but prevents the heat it creates from leaving."
Science,"This greenhouse effect is what keeps our planet warm and habitable enough for life. However, the amount of one particular greenhouse gas was rising, carbon dioxide or CO2. CO2 is naturally one of the most notable greenhouse gases besides water vapor, but we can also release CO2 by burning wood or fossil fuels like coal and oil. Over time, humans have increasingly relied on these fuels to power things like planes, cars, and trains as well as to generate electricity."
Science,"As a result of these human activities, more CO2 is being released into the atmosphere than ever before, much more than is normally released by the Earth and at a much faster rate. The increasingly heavy blanket of greenhouse gases is trapping excess heat in our atmosphere rather than allowing more of it to radiate into space as normal. This is what's causing Earth's average temperature to rise beyond what scientists would expect based on historical patterns."
Science,"While scientists once referred to this process as global warming, most now prefer the more general term, climate change. A world that's a little bit warmer on average might not seem like such a big deal, but we've learned that even a small shift in the planet's natural processes can have drastic consequences. When studying the early signs of climate change, scientists predicted that as cold places like North and South Pole got warmer, the ice would begin to melt."
Science,"All of that frozen water suddenly flowing into the oceans would cause sea levels to rise, which would affect the planet's weather system. Have you heard all the news about weird weather in the past few years? Snow in places that's usually warm and dry, or drought in places that are usually cold and rainy, huge fires during extremely hot summers, severe storms battering coastlines and flooding cities."
Science,"Many of these natural hazards used to be somewhat rare, but now they're becoming more common, exactly as climate scientists predicted. People have relied on relatively consistent weather patterns for generations, so they aren't prepared to adapt to these changes in their local environment. Communities that are already feeling the effects of climate change are worried that they're gonna lose their homes, their livelihoods, or their sources of food and water."
Science,"Scientists are working on technologies that can help us remove some of the excess CO2 from the atmosphere, but in the meantime they recommend that we emit less CO2 in the first place. This would allow us to limit how much the global average temperature increases, giving communities time to adapt to changes in their surroundings. Of course, it's complicated to change the way our societies work."
Science,"To help reduce CO2 emissions, you may see some people advocating for tweaking individual behaviors, like eating plant-based diets or using low carbon transportation methods. You may see others saying that since large organizations in highly populated countries emit the most CO2, we need to push them to make more wide raging institutional changes. As someone who works in environmental science, I know that sorting through all of these different facts and opinions on climate change can be overwhelming."
Science,"It's difficult to think about living in a world that may be very different from what I've always known in the past. I've found it helpful to both adopt simple sustainable habits in my own life, while also seeking out community groups that work on bigger initiatives. It's easier to imagine the future when you help others to shape it. Now that we've taken some time to think about Earth's past and what's happening to it in the present, try looking towards the future of our planet."
Science,What is your ideal future? And how can you help to make it happen?.
Science,"Iman, why should folks be excited about Middle School Physics? - So, Middle School Physics is, like, the only science out there that explains how things happen. And so basically everything's made of matter. Me, you, the chair that I'm sitting on, and this course is gonna explore how we exist in the natural world."
Science,"So, for example, we talk a little bit about movement in forces, and we learn that everything that we have a collision with has this equal but opposite force that's applied when the collision happens. So that's why when you give those high fives, and then your hand starts stinging. It's because the same force you gave your buddy is the same force they gave you back. And then we also talk about force in a way where it doesn't touch you. So, like, I'm thinking like ""Star Wars""."
Science,"There's, like, this force energy like gravitational. There's magnetic energy. There's electric energy. And then finally we get into waves, and we talk a little bit about how waves, you know, exists, whether it's sound waves or even the waves in the ocean. What do you think is exciting about it? - Oh, well that's a dangerous question to ask me. I wanted to be a physicist, and I still aspire to be it, because, you know, we kind of wake up in this cosmos, and we're just trying to understand where we fit in."
Science,"And physics asks the most fundamental questions about how the universe works. And so when I first learned about Newton's laws, and fields, and all of the things that you just touched on, it started to give me goosebumps, 'cause I'm like, wow, we can finally understand how the universe fits together, and then use that to make predictions, and then think about things that we don't understand. And there is so much that we don't understand."
Science,"So I think this is the beginning of a very, very exciting journey in physics. - I agree, Sal. (gentle music)."
Science,"We use units whenever we talk about things like position, where an object is located, how long it is, it's mass, how much matter it's made up of or it's motion. How is that object moving? You probably hear units every day. For example, you've grown, let's say an inch and a half in the past year, or that tree over there is 25 feet tall. And maybe you went swimming in a 25 meter pool."
Science,"And we're just gonna pretend that the pool is a rectangle because as you can tell from my tree, my artistic skills are not that great. Anyway, this brings up a super important point about why we use units. I just used three examples of length measurements with three different units, inches, feet, and meters. Imagine if I didn't attach a unit to any of these measurements, you grew one and a half, what? Meters? Whoa, one and a half hands."
Science,"Well, whose hands? Your hands or my hands? Woof, well, pretend those are hands. Units let us know how much of a quantity there is. So a meter is always used to measure length and we know exactly how long a meter is. That way when we say something is two meters long, no one has to guess at how big that is. Any measurement or data point always needs to have a unit or else it's just a meaningless number. To avoid any confusion, in science we use what are called SI units. SI units are the International System."
Science,"Could there be any more letters in this word system used by scientists all over the world. We'll use meters to describe position or length, kilograms for mass, and if we're talking about the motion of something, meters per second. And while this is the agreed upon scientific unit system, you should be aware that other systems do exist, which means things can very easily get very confusing if you forget your units."
Science,"And you might be thinking, ""Oh, come on, who mixes up units?' Well, it happens more often than you think, even rocket scientists have done it. I mean, a Mars Orbiter actually crashed due to a mix up in units. Now seriously, that actually happened, look it up and remember to use your units.."
Science,"We talk about units in another video, so let's look at what a frame of reference is. Let's say this blue box thing is a car, and it's going 45 miles per hour. Someone standing on the side of the road would see it pass at 45 miles per hour. Now, if this yellow truck is going 40 miles per hour someone sitting in the yellow truck would observe the blue traveling at five miles per hour."
Science,"How could the person on the side of the road see the blue car traveling at 45 miles per hour and a person in the yellow truck see the blue car moving at five miles per hour? This is because both observers are using different frames of reference. So let's go ahead and take a look at that, starting with the speed of the blue car. The person on the side of the road is using their frame of reference of being at rest. So relative to them, the blue car is moving at 45 miles per hour."
Science,"To the person in this yellow truck, which remember is already going 40 miles per hour, the blue car is going five miles per hour. Now let's do the exact same thing for the speed of the yellow truck. So what is the speed of the yellow truck for the observer on the side of the road? It's 40 miles per hour."
Science,"And what do you think the speed of the truck is for the person using their blue car as the reference frame? Well, the blue car is moving at 45 miles per hour, and the truck is only moving at 40 miles per hour. So the speed of the yellow truck is actually five miles per hour slower than this reference frame, because the blue car is already moving at 45 miles per hour. Now you might be thinking, ""But wait, ""the person on the side of the road isn't really at rest."
Science,"""They're on the earth and the earth is moving."" You're completely correct. The person is at rest with respect to the earth. And the earth is the most common frame of reference that we use. To an observer in space who is not rotating with the earth, the blue car is going 45 miles per hour, plus the speed of Earth's rotation. And this is why a frame of reference is so important. We just talked about one blue car having three different velocities depending what the frame of reference is."
Science,"How would we communicate this to avoid confusion? Well, we state the reference frame we're using. The blue car is moving at five miles per hour with respect to, which I'll write as WRT, the yellow truck. This tells us that the yellow truck is our frame of reference. Or we could say that the yellow truck is moving at 40 miles per hour and the blue car at 45 miles per hour, with respect to the earth."
Science,"That way everyone is on the same page, a page which, to be clear, is in a book that relative to me is at rest.."
Science,"There's other ways to think about it. And so let's say that this first asteroid is twice the mass of either of these two smaller ones. And these two smaller ones have the same mass. Now, we've attached the back of a rocket to each of these asteroids. In fact, this one over here has two rockets, and we're going to assume that all of the rockets are equivalent and we ignite them all. And so they all exert the same force each on the asteroid."
Science,"So for example, we have a net force acting leftward on this large asteroid. We have the same net force acting on this smaller asteroid, also going to the left. And on this other smaller asteroid, we have two times that net force acting to the left. So what I want you to do is pause this video and think about which of these asteroids is going to be accelerated the most, and which of these asteroids is going to be accelerated the least. All right."
Science,"So you might have an intuition that the larger the force, the more acceleration you might see. So let me write it like this. So you might get a sense that if you increase your force, that that's also going to increase your acceleration. And it does turn out that that is indeed the case. Now, the other notion that you might have is that the more of the stuff that there is, the more mass that you have, the harder it is to accelerate it. So if you're mass is larger, than your acceleration is lower."
Science,"And it turns out that these things are all proportional. So for example, if we just compare these two masses right over here, they have the same net force acting on it. And I keep saying net force, that means you just net out all of the forces acting in a certain dimension. For example, if I had another identical rocket acting in the opposite direction, they would net out, and this asteroid right over here wouldn't be accelerated at all."
Science,"But going back to our example here, we have the same net force acting on each of these asteroids. But the first asteroid has twice the mass of the second asteroid. So how do you think the accelerations will relate? Well, as you might imagine, the acceleration on the larger asteroid is going to be half the acceleration on this asteroid. Or another way to think about it, this asteroid is going to have twice the acceleration as this first asteroid. And that's because it has half the mass."
Science,"And one way you can relate force, mass, and acceleration, and this is one of the most important equations in all of physics, is that force is going to be equal to mass times acceleration, or I could say the magnitude of the force is equal to the mass times the magnitude of the acceleration. So notice, in this example right over here, our forces are the same, but the masses are different. If I have half the mass as I have over here, I'm going to have twice the acceleration."
Science,"And that might make intuitive sense if you've ever tried to apply the same force to something that has a small mass versus something that has a large mass. Now, if we compare these two asteroids, they have the same mass here, but the force here, the net force, acting in that left direction, is double. So if you double the force, don't change the mass. Well, then you're going to have twice the acceleration."
Science,"So this is going to have twice the acceleration of this one, and this one's going to have twice the acceleration of that one. But the important thing to realize is how force, mass, and acceleration are connected.."
Science,"Well, what do you think that's going to do to the asteroid? Well, it's going to push on the asteroid in that direction. Or you could say it's going to exert a force on that asteroid. And we could show that force like this, where the strength of that force, or the magnitude of the force, is the length of this line. And then the direction, I will specify or show with that arrow. So fair enough, I will be pushing towards the left."
Science,"And when I push to the left, it doesn't just start to move the asteroid to the left, it actually will accelerate the asteroid to the left. So the longer that this rocket is running, it's going to make the asteroid move to the left faster and faster and faster. But let's think about another example. Let's say that you and one of your friends, you have a little bit of miscommunication, and they went and put an identical rocket on this side of the asteroid. And y'all ignited it at the exact same time."
Science,"So this one is going to push in the other direction. What do you think is going to happen if these happened at the exact same time? Even though there's now twice as much force being exerted on this asteroid, it's going in opposite directions, so they zero out, and so there's zero net force. And so this asteroid won't be accelerated at all."
Science,"Now let's say that a third friend wanted to correct this situation, and this isn't necessarily the most efficient way to do it, but what they do is they put another identical rocket right over here, and let's say ignite that. Now what will happen? Well, now you had the original two forces that net out to each other. But now you have this also this new force, which I will make in purple, 'cause it's a purple rocket."
Science,"And so that new force, you could draw like this, to show, all right, that will now be the net force, 'cause you have the equivalent of two rockets going in the left direction, and one rocket going in the right direction. Or another way we could draw that is we have two rockets going in the left direction, so that would have a force that looks like this. And then we have one going in the right direction. And so if you were to net it out, this is equivalent to just having one rocket that we originally saw."
Science,"That's equivalent to just going back to what we originally saw. So the important takeaway from this video is that it's not just about the force that's being applied. If you wanna think about how something might be accelerated, and in what direction, you need to think about the net force, because some of the forces could counteract each other.."
Science,"So I have two examples here where Newton's third law or this notion of an action and a reaction force is happening. So over here, you have this plane flying and the plane is able to move forward by pushing air particles through these jet engines. So these air particles are pushed outward at a very, very high velocity out the back of the engines. If you are to enlarge one of those air particles, let's say, this is this purple dot right over here."
Science,"There is a force that is being exerted on it by the jet engine. And that force is going in that direction. So what is the equal and opposite reaction force? Well, the equal and opposite reaction force is not also are occurring on that molecule. It's what the molecule is doing to the plane. The equal and opposite reaction force is that the molecule is going to be pushing on the jet engine with an equal but an opposite force. So it's going to go in the opposite direction."
Science,"And that's how the jet is able to accelerate forward by pushing on these particles and accelerating them backward by exerting a force on them. The equal and opposite force is the force that the particles, those molecules of air are exerting on the jet and moving it forward. The same thing here is going on with this rocket. You have some rocket fuel in there. It gets ignited. It explodes. And as it explodes, there's a force that exerts on those little molecules and that force is going in this direction."
Science,"But as it does that, there's an equal and opposite force that the molecules are exerting on the rocket. The rocket is having a force acted on it, once again, equal and opposite. So it's important to realize that the reaction force is not on the same object. It's on the other object. If one object is putting an action force on another, then the second object is putting a reaction force on the first. The forces do not cancel out."
Science,It's also important to realize that both forces are generated in pairs and happen at the exact same time. There's no delay. We can look at other examples of this. This is a scenario that I would never want to be caught in being drifting through space. Now this astronaut here has some type of a rocket pack that might help him move around. But let's say that your rocket pack ran out of fuel and you're just drifting through space.
Science,"How can you get back to your spaceship? Well, if you have a wrench or something on you that you can throw, if you can take that wrench, and if you can push that wrench in that direction, and let's say your spaceship is over here to the left. Well, the equal and opposite force is the force that the wrench is going to exert on you, the astronaut, and then it will push you in that direction and accelerate you in that direction. So that's a useful thing, if you're ever get caught drifting through space."
Science,"But you could do an experiment right now. Press on the table in front of you. When you press on that table, you're clearly putting a force onto that table. If your table is soft, you will see it get compressed. But notice your finger itself is also getting compressed. And the whole reason why you can even feel that is because your finger is getting compressed. And that is the equal and opposite force that the table is putting on your finger. And this can happen at very, very large distances as well."
Science,"The whole reason why the Moon is in orbit around the Earth is because there's a gravitational force of Earth's mass acting on the Moon. But there's an equal and opposite force of the Moon acting on Earth. And it's actually not that the Moon is rotating around the Earth. It's actually, they're both rotating around the center of mass of their combination, that just happens to be so much closer to Earth. It's actually within Earth's volume that it looks like the Moon is rotating around the Earth."
Science,"And this isn't just celestial bodies. I weigh 165 pounds. That is the force that Earth is acting on me due to gravity, but it turns out that there's an equal and opposite force of 165 pounds that I am pulling on Earth with. So I will leave you there. Look around the world. This is happening everywhere. For every force, there's an equal and opposite reaction force. But they don't cancel out because they're acting on different bodies.."
Science,"So gravitational force is actually attracting the lamp to the floor and these forces exist between all objects with mass. So let's write these key points out about gravitational forces, which I'm going to use GF to represent. We said they are attractive forces, and that they exist between all objects with mass. Objects with mass, to explain this, we first need to remember a couple of things. Mass is how much matter objects have, and matter is the stuff an object is made of."
Science,"Any object with mass generates a gravitational pull. So, there is a gravitational force of attraction between every object. The amount of gravitational force between two objects will depend on two things: the masses of the two objects and the distance between them. The mass of each object is proportional to the gravitational force. This means that the more mass an object has the stronger it's gravitational force. And, now, we can understand why gravity makes things fall. The Earth has massive, literally."
Science,"It's almost six septillion kilograms. That's a 6 with 24 zeros after it. So, it generates a huge attractive force. For comparison, my lamp is only one kilogram, which is why if I jump, I fall towards the Earth and not towards my lamp. But we said the mass of the object is just one factor affecting the strength of its gravitational force. The other is the distance between objects. The more distance between the objects the weaker the gravitational pull between them."
Science,"For small objects without much mass, it doesn't take much distance for their gravitational forces between each other to be so weak that we don't notice them. For something like the Earth, you have to go really far away to not be affected by its gravitational force of attraction. I mean, look at the moon, it's almost 240,000 miles away, that's almost 400,000 kilometers away, and it still feels effects from Earth's gravity."
Science,"That's why it's orbiting us, but since the moon is also a pretty massive object, we do experience the effects of its gravitational pull on the Earth. This is why we have tides, the moon's gravitational force will pull on Earth's water, which results in us having high and low tides."
Science,"Now, you might be wondering if gravity can affect the moon, or cause tides, how can we even move around? Why aren't we just face planted on the ground because Earth's gravity is pulling us towards it? It turns out that actually gravity is a pretty weak force. We only even notice its effects when an object is massive, like planets or stars, and the gravitational force on you is way weaker than most forces you exert every day."
Science,"In fact, every time you pick up a glass of water, you're overpowering the entire mass of Earth. How cool is that?."
Science,"If you've ever noticed two balloons repelling each other, or if you've ever noticed your hair sticking to something like a balloon or a sweater, that's what I'm talking about. But why is there an electric force between the shirt and the sock after they're taken out of the dryer? Well, it turns out that electric forces are caused by a property of matter called electric charge. Matter is made up of tiny particles that can have positive, negative, or neutral charge."
Science,"Neutral just means that the electric charge is zero, not positive or negative. When you add up all these charges most objects tend to have a net charge that is about neutral. Otherwise we'd be attracted to all sorts of things, just like that sock. However, an object's charge can change. So in the dryer all that heat and movement allowed some negative charges from the shirt to move to the sock."
Science,"Now, when you try to separate the two, they're both electrically charged and there's an electric force between them. So now that we know what causes an electric force, let's look at what affects its direction and strength. An electric force can attract or repel an object. But how do you know if an electric force will be attractive or repulsive? Well, as the saying goes, opposites attract. An object with a negative electric charge will be attracted to a positively charged object."
Science,"If the second object is also negatively charged, well, the two objects will experience a repulsive force and be repelled from each other. So in order to have the sock and the shirt attracted to each other they must have opposite net charges because they're experiencing an attractive electric force. What about the strength of that electric force? Strength will depend on a couple of factors. First, the charge of each object is proportional to the force."
Science,"The stronger the charges, the stronger the electric force. So the greater the electric charge, the greater the electric force. Another factor, how far apart the objects are from each other. The electric force will weaken as the distance increases. So the force decreases as our distance increases. As you move the sock away from the shirt eventually the attraction between them is so weak that we don't even notice it."
Science,"So the next time you find yourself doing laundry and having to pull a sock off of a shirt, just remember invisible electric forces are to blame.."
Science,"So magnets can be used to stick things together, point us in the right direction, and even lift things, and they do this through magnetic forces. If you've handled two magnets, you felt magnetic forces, even when the magnets weren't touching each other. That's because magnetic forces are non-contact forces, which just means they can affect other objects they aren't even touching. Magnets will attract or repel each other, and this attraction or repulsion is a magnetic force."
Science,"But magnetic forces don't affect everything the same way. Otherwise, a magnet would stick to you, not just a refrigerator. In this video, we're going to talk about the magnetic forces between two magnets. So why do magnet sometimes attract each other and other times repel each other? Well, this has to do with the orientation of the magnets. Orientation is really just a fancy word for how the magnets are positioned compared to one another."
Science,"You see, it turns out that each magnet has a north and south pole, but what does this have to do with attraction or repulsion? Well, as you may have heard, opposites attract. So, if you face the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of another magnet, guess what? They will be attracted to each other. But if you turn one of those magnets around so that you have two north poles facing each other, they will repel. And the same thing would happen if it was two south pulse facing each other."
Science,"So the direction of the magnetic force completely depends on the orientation of the magnets. Orientation, though, is just one thing that affects magnetic forces. The strength of magnetic forces depends on a couple of things. For one, distance. If you've ever held two magnets, you may have noticed that when you move them closer, they seem to almost jump together. Or if you try to push two light poles together, they get harder and harder to hold together the closer you get."
Science,"This is because magnetic forces depend on distance. The closer the two magnets are together, the stronger the force between them. So, as the distance decreases, the force increases, but the farther away they are, the weaker the magnetic force is. So, distance increases; force decreases. The other big factor that affects how strong a magnetic force is... Well, the magnets themselves. Sub magnets are really weak, like a lot of refrigerator magnets."
Science,"Others are so strong that even tiny ones can be almost impossible to pull apart. Some of these stronger magnets are even used to make high-speed trains levitate off the ground. And yes, this rectangle is supposed to be a train. While my drawing isn't amazing, the fact that magnetic forces can levitate a train is.."
Science,"Instead, these forces act over a region. So if an object is in that region, it will be affected by the force. In this case, the ball is in Earth's gravitational field, and so it feels an attractive force towards the Earth and the ball falls to the ground. Field forces include non-contact forces, such as electric, magnetic, and of course, gravitational forces."
Science,"So since these forces are non-contact, they can exert a force on objects they aren't touching, but how do these objects know if there's a force between them? To explain these non-contact forces, scientists eventually developed the idea that these objects were surrounded by something called a field. So what is a field? A field extends through space from an object with certain physical properties. What are those? Well, for gravitational forces, these affect objects with mass."
Science,"So any object with mass has a gravitational field surrounding it that points towards the object's center. The further you move away from the object, the less dense the field and weaker the field becomes. Electric forces effect charged objects. So an electric field surrounds any object with a net charge, and the direction of this field will depend on the charge. Magnetic fields will affect magnets and any other material with magnetic properties."
Science,"Each spot on a field has two things associated with it: magnitude and direction. And these help us predict what forces objects will experience when they're in the field. So let's look at an example to help understand this. Say we have a planet. Now, the planet has a lot of mass so we know it's going to be surrounded by a gravitational field that points towards the center of the planet. I can draw these little field lines that show the direction of the field and its strength."
Science,"As we move away from the planet, the field will start to weaken, and I'm going to represent that by a less dense field with these arrows. Now, let's say there's an asteroid moving near the planet in this direction. I know that the asteroid, as it's shown here, is in the outskirts of this planet's gravitational field. So it is going to feel some gravitational attraction towards the planet, which we can draw with this vector, Fg, which is force of gravity."
Science,"Now, because it's attracted to the planet, the astroid will continue to move towards the planet. And the closer the asteroid gets to the planet, the stronger the field and the stronger the force of attraction it will feel. And so in this way, scientists can use fields to help predict behavior of objects experiencing non-contact forces. And all of this may sound kind of odd, but you probably already think about forces this way."
Science,"For example, if we go back to the ball that you know is going to fall, you knew this because the force of gravity from Earth was going to pull the ball towards the Earth. But now you also know that that's because Earth's gravity is a field force. And so the ball is in the field of gravity for Earth and experiences an attractive gravitational force. So while fields may sound mysterious, they really just mean that a force is felt over a distance."
Science,"Gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces are all field forces, which means they act over distance and can affect a lot of objects.."
Science,"Let's take a moment to look at the definition of what an electromagnet is. Electromagnets are materials that become magnets in the presence of electricity. But how does that even happen? Well, it turns out that electrically-charged particles in motion actually have small magnetic fields around them. So, if we run electricity through a wire, a magnetic field will be created around the wire. Now, we can control the strength of this magnetic field in a couple of ways."
Science,"We can move more electric charges through the wire at a faster rate, and we do this by increasing the electrical current. The second way is to increase the density of the charged particles, and we can do this by looping the wire into a coil. This gives us more charged particles with magnetic fields in a small space, strengthening the magnetic force. The other thing we can control with electromagnets is the direction of the magnetic field, and we can do this by changing the direction of the electricity."
Science,"So if we go back to this wire example from earlier and change the direction of the electricity running through that wire, well, the magnetic fields will also change direction. This makes electromagnets quite different from permanent magnets. So let's take a look at that and compare permanent magnets to electromagnets. Electromagnets are typically made of loops of wire and a coil. The wire is typically made of metal like copper and wrapped around pieces of metal like iron, nickel, or cobalt."
Science,"This is different from a permanent magnet because permanent magnets don't need this wire. Permanent magnets also have fixed poles. You can't change the north and south poles on these magnets, but as we now know, for electromagnets, we can change these poles by changing the direction of the electrical current. So, if we have an electromagnet with a north and south pole that looks like this and a current flowing in this direction, well, we can change the poles and the direction of the current."
Science,"Permanent magnets have a fixed strength, but we just talked about how we can change the strength of electromagnets, so electromagnets have adjustable strength. And finally, electromagnets need a power source in order to generate the electricity required to produce magnetic fields. Permanent magnets do not need a power source, but this means that we can also turn electromagnets on and off, which is pretty cool when you think about it. On the other hand, permanent magnets are always on."
Science,"Now, you might be thinking if electrical charge can affect magnetism, can magnetism affect electrical charge? Absolutely, let's look at how we can do that. The only way to do this is by changing the magnetic field around the charged particles. This can be done by moving magnets closer or further away from the particles or by spinning the magnets. In fact, spinning magnets is how most of the electricity we use in cities and homes is generated."
Science,"A turbine spins a magnet inside a coil to produce electricity, and since electromagnets need a power source, this turbine is powered by wind. So you can see why electromagnetism is an incredibly important force, and this isn't the only important application of it. We use electromagnets in all sorts of other applications, from motors to speakers and even medical scanners.."
Science,"Any massive object that is in motion then has kinetic energy, but how much? First, let's consider some comparisons. This nice rat family, papa, mama, brother, and sister are sitting down to dinner at a long table passing blocks of cheese back-and-forth. Papa rat asks for the cheddar cheese and there are two identical blocks. Brother rat pushes one and sister rat pushes the other, so that the second cheese is traveling twice as fast as the first cheese."
Science,"Which piece of cheddar cheese do you think has more kinetic energy? Yes, it's the one going faster. Now, papa rat doesn't need both pieces of cheddar, so he eats one and sends one back, along with this small piece of Swiss that weighs half as much as the piece of cheddar. Papa rat has better manners than his children, so he sends them both back at the same speed."
Science,"Which piece of cheese would you think has more kinetic energy now? Yes, the heavier or more massive object, in this case, the cheddar, will have more kinetic energy. Let's make it a little more complicated. Brother and sister rat are full, so they send the cheeses back for mama rat. Brother rat pushes the larger piece of cheddar and sister rat pushes the smaller piece of Swiss so that the Swiss is going twice as fast as the cheddar."
Science,"Now, which cheese has more kinetic energy? In fact, it turns out that it's the Swiss in this scenario. Kinetic energy depends on both mass and speed, but the dependence on speed is stronger. This estimation of kinetic energy can be quantified in an equation that lets us calculate kinetic energy exactly. We said kinetic energy depends on the mass and the speed, which we'll write as V for velocity, so we can start with K E equals M times V."
Science,"But we said that it depends more on the speed, so the velocity here is actually squared. This means that if an object's mass doubles, its kinetic energy also doubles, but if its speed doubles, the kinetic energy actually quadruples. And there's also a constant factor of 1/2 at the beginning of the equation, but we won't go into the details of the math of deriving this today. So, this is the equation for kinetic energy, 1/2 M V squared. Let's apply this equation to our cheesy example."
Science,"Say the Swiss has a mass of .05 kilograms, which makes the cheddar's mass .1 kilograms. When both cheeses have the same speed, say two meters per second, the cheddar's kinetic energy is 1/2 times .1 kilograms, times two meters per second squared, which is .2 Joules. The Swiss's kinetic energy is 1/2 times .05 kilograms times two meters per second squared, which is .1 Joules, or half the kinetic energy of the cheddar."
Science,"So we can see that at the same speed, the cheddar has more kinetic energy because it has more mass. But when the Swiss has a speed of four meters per second and the cheddar still has a speed of two meters per second, the Swiss's kinetic energy is now 1/2 times .05 kilograms times four meters per second squared, which is .4 Joules. So now, the kinetic energy of the Swiss is twice the kinetic energy of the cheddar."
Science,"So we can see that even though the cheddar has more mass the Swiss has more kinetic energy because it's going faster. In summary, kinetic energy is the motion energy of an object. The equation for kinetic energy is 1/2 M V squared. So as mass increases, kinetic energy increases, like the more massive cheddar versus the Swiss, and as velocity increases, kinetic energy increases even more, like the speedy Swiss versus the slower cheddar. Thanks for watching, and I hope you learned a little bit of something.."
Science,"There are many kinds of potential energy, but they all arise from an object's relation to a position, or an original shape. So while in general, there are many different types of potential energy, there are several specific types that are very common. So, let's talk about these. Gravitational potential energy is the potential energy that an object with mass has due to the force of gravity from another object with mass, like say, the Earth."
Science,"And in fact, we often use the surface of the Earth to compare an object's position with to see how much potential energy it has in the Earth's gravitational field. Gravity is an attractive force, so objects with mass want to move towards the surface of the Earth. If we move them further away, or opposite the direction of the gravitational force, we increase their gravitational potential energy. And the opposite is true if it gets closer."
Science,"When an object is on the surface of Earth, we typically say it has no potential energy, but you could use any point to be this comparison where potential energy is zero. Consider a book on a bookshelf. If the book is on this shelf, we can use this shelf as the 0.4 potential energy. Moving it to a higher shelf would mean it has gravitational potential energy relative to that lower shelf, or relative to the floor if we want to use that as our comparison instead."
Science,"Next, we have elastic potential energy, which is the potential energy some objects have due to their shape being changed. These types of objects are called elastic objects. Elastic objects are made of materials and designed, so they have internal or inside forces that try to return them to their original shape. One very common example of this is a spring. When you stretch or compress a spring, you change its shape."
Science,"And the shape of the spring causes internal forces that try to return the spring to its original shape. Now electric potential energy, which is the potential energy a charged object has due to the electric force from another charged object. Opposite electric charges are attracted to one another, and similar electric charges are repelled. So the potential energy depends on what type of charges there are, and how far apart they are."
Science,"Potential energy increases when the charges move opposite the direction of the electric force, for example, when two negative charges get closer together. Similarly, magnetic potential energy is the potential energy a magnetic object has due to the magnetic force from another magnet. Magnetic force causes similar poles to repel one another, and opposite poles to attract."
Science,"And because magnets have north and south poles, the potential energy depends not only on the position within a field, but also the magnets orientation. Again, you could increase the potential energy by moving the magnets opposite the direction of the magnetic force. For example, by pulling apart a North Pole and a South Pole. All of these types of energy are due to different forces, and are calculated differently from different equations, which we won't cover here, but they are all potential energy."
Science,"And these are just a few of the most common types of potential energy, but there are more. In summary, potential energy is the stored energy in an object due to its position, its properties, and the forces acting on it. Potential energy is measured relative to some comparison position or shape, and describes the potential for other forms of energy, commonly kinetic energy for motion, to exist. There are many forms of potential energy, including gravitational, elastic, magnetic, and electric."
Science,"Thanks for watching, and I hope you learned a little bit of something.."
Science,"You would see a pattern that looks like this. Now, what would be a good definition for a wave? Well, we could call it a traveling disturbance. Well, what does that mean? Well, we're disturbing the rope. If we didn't move it, if we just held it straight, it might look something like that, or it might just hang down a little bit, but clearly we are now moving it up and down, and those movements are disturbing that rope and that disturbance can move along that rope."
Science,"Now, we see waves not just in ropes that are moving up and down. You have probably seen water waves. If you were to take a tank of water like this and if you were to start pressing on one end of the water here, you would see these wave forms that start. We can also see that with sound and sound waves. You might not realize it, but the sound of my voice right now is actually just a traveling compression, or disturbance in the air that is getting to your ear."
Science,"And that little hairs in your ears can sense those changes in pressure from the air and your mind perceives that as sound. And once again, this is a traveling disturbance. You have particles that have high pressure, and then they knock into the particles next to them, that then knock into the particles next to them. So if you were to be able to observe this in slow motion, you would see these high pressure parts right over here could be traveling, say to the right."
Science,"And even though this might be a pressure wave that's traveling through the air, we can represent it in a way that looks a lot like our first rope that we were moving up and down. Areas where things are high, in the sound example, that's high pressure, and you have areas where things are low, in the sound example, that is low pressure. Now, when we talk about waves, there are common properties."
Science,"For example, we might wanna know, how much are we getting disturbed from what we would call the equilibrium? You could view that as maybe the middle state right over there. Well, if we're getting disturbed that much, we could call that the amplitude. That's how much we are going above or below that equilibrium. This would be the amplitude as well. We could think about how far is it from the same points on the wave."
Science,"So if we go from one peak to another peak, well, we could call that the wavelength, and you could just do it from any one point on the wave that's just like it on the wave again. So that would be the same wavelength as our original wavelength right over there. You might hear the term frequency of a wave. And one way to think about that is if you were to just observe our original rope, and if you were to say, ""How many times does it go all the way up, all the way down, and then back up."
Science,"so it completes a full cycle? How many times can it do that in a second? If it does that five times in second, then someone might say it has a frequency of five cycles per second. Now, everything that we have just talked about, these are called mechanical waves. It's a special category, probably the ones that you will see most often. Now, mechanical waves need a medium to travel through. In the rope example, the medium was the rope. In the water example, it's the water."
Science,"In the sound example, the medium is the air. Now, there are things that can be described as waves that don't need a medium. In particular, and this is kind of mind boggling, is that light can be considered a wave. If we think about the different frequencies of light, our brain perceives that as different colors. And if we think about the amplitude of light, our brain perceives that as the intensity of light, how bright it is."
Science,"And even more mindblowing, visible light are just certain frequencies of what we would call electromagnetic waves. There's actually higher frequencies of electromagnetic waves that have all sorts of applications. You might have heard of ultraviolet light, or x-rays, or gamma rays. Similarly, there's lower wavelengths of light. You might have heard things like infrared, or radio waves. These are all just different frequencies of what's known as electromagnetic waves.."
Science,"What's going to travel through 93 million miles of the vacuum of space, and that's one of the amazing things about light waves is that they don't need a medium. They can travel through vacuum, through emptiness, but then it's gonna travel through several miles of Earth's atmosphere. So it's going to travel through several miles of Earth's atmosphere."
Science,"It will hit these, the lenses of these sunglasses, the light will travel through the lenses of the sunglass, little sunglass has some width or some depth to it, and then it'll go out onto the other side and it will hit the sand right over here. Now, one thing you might realize is the amount of transmission and what gets transmitted is dependent on the wavelengths of the wave, in this case, the wavelengths of light, and also about the material that they are going through."
Science,"So for example, these sunglasses right over here, many sunglasses try to keep out UV light, ultraviolet light, which is a higher frequency than visible light, but that's what causes sunburns and that can also damage your eyes. So those high frequencies are not making it through."
Science,"And we can also see that this sunglass right over here, it kind of has an orange color, which means that things that are closer to that end of the spectrum, closer to the red, the oranges, and the yellows are getting through, which means that it's filtering out blue light. So the blue light, isn't getting transmitted through as much as say the red, orange, and yellow light and that's why we see this as red, orange, or yellow. And then, of course, the light will get to that sand particle."
Science,"Now transmission, as I mentioned, it isn't just about light waves. We could talk about one of our other favorite types of waves, for example, sound waves. If you are in a room, you have probably experienced the fact that even if you were to close the door, and I do this a lot because I record a lot of videos. This is me in my little closet recording a video. This is a top view for what I'm doing right now. A lot of times my kids are in other parts of the house and they're making a lot of noise."
Science,"And as we've talked about, sound waves are nothing but traveling pressure waves through the air. Those air particles are knocking one into another. But in order to make it to me, they need to get through that wall, and the way they do that is they get transmitted through that wall."
Science,"So those air particles make the particles or make the atoms or the molecules in the walls start vibrating, they bump into each other, and then the particles on the other side of the wall will bump into the air in my little closet, and then we will have, once again, the sound waves make it to me. Now, the overall magnitude of sound, the volume of the sound, will likely be diminished and not all of the frequencies of the sound will be transmitted equally."
Science,"Different frequencies of sound waves are better at traveling through certain materials, just as we talked about with light waves. So now when you look at the world around you, or you hear the world around you, or look at other types of waves, just think about how it's transmitting from one material into another.."
Science,"Now, if you were to look at this with your eyes, you wouldn't be able to see the actual waves, like we're seeing in this diagram right over here. You would just see how your brain or how your mind perceives the various frequencies, and that's why they made the higher frequencies here more like a violet or a purple color, and that's why they made the lower frequencies here more of a red color, because that's how your brain or your mind would perceive them."
Science,"But you can see as this light goes from, let's say the vacuum to this prism, to this crystal or this glass, the high-frequency light gets bent more, and the low-frequency light, which still gets bent, gets bent less, and then that essentially spreads out all of the wavelengths."
Science,"When we have white light, it has all of the visible wavelengths in it, but when it hits a prism like this, if you imagine a triangular piece of glass or crystal and it hits it at an angle, well, then the different wavelengths spread out, and if you were to put a piece of paper here, you would see a rainbow, and that's actually how rainbows are formed. A bunch of water particles in the air refract light exactly like this."
Science,"This process of when light goes from one transparent medium to another, or a vacuum, to some other medium that it can travel through that's transparent, if it hits it in an angle, it can get bent, which is what we called refraction. This is why when you look at a cup of water or at a pool at an angle, you're not seeing directly through the pool. The image gets distorted.."
Science,"It looks like, once we fill it with water, at least to our eye, it looks like the pencil gets bent or broken or bent in some way. And this notion, you might have heard people call it refraction. But it's interesting thing about exactly why this is happening. And I'll give you a hint. This is all about the bending of light. And it's not just light that can get bent as it goes from one medium into another. It can be any kind of wave. So let's think about what's going on over here."
Science,"So first, let's think about the part of the pencil that is above the water. So this part right over here, the light is actually reflecting off of this pencil, and then it's bouncing straight into our eye. So just imagine a path from this dot straight into your eye. Once again, from here, it's going straight into your eye. When we go over here, it still doesn't look too distorted. So you have light that's going straight to your eye. It's going through the side of the glass and then getting to your eye."
Science,"But then once we get under the water, something's interesting. You would expect the point that would have been here would then go straight to your eye just like everything up here. But it turns out that that light, once it transitions from going from the water to the glass and then the air, it bends. So at the interface between the media, between those different materials that the light is traveling through, instead of going towards your eye, it gets bent, in this case to our left."
Science,"And so that's why when we look straight on here, we don't see anything in this region right over here. But the light that was going from the pencil towards this part of the glass, which typically you would not see, that would have typically just gone straight in that direction and not hit your eye, well, now that is getting refracted. It's getting bent to the left so that now that light hits your eye. So that's why you see what looks like a broken pencil."
Science,It's all about the light getting bent as it exits the water and goes into the glass and then the air..
Science,"And as it goes to that boundary from one medium to another, its direction can change. And we talk about that in another video, and we call that refraction. We have refraction when we enter the material, and then we have more refraction when we get out. Now, there's other things that light can also do, and that's the focus of this video, reflection and absorption. Now you probably have a sense of what happens with reflection. We can see a reflection of the mountains in the lake right over here."
Science,"And the reason why we can see the reflection of the mountains and the lake here is because light that is coming from this mountain is hitting the lake and then it is bouncing off of it, and then coming to an observer's eyeball right over here, and so they see the light that's coming from here, they see it as coming from over here, because it is bounced off. And so reflection is exactly that, light is coming in, it hits that other material, and then if it bounces off, that's reflection."
Science,"Now, the other thing that light can do is get absorbed. Absorbed is when the material doesn't reflect any, it doesn't transmit any through it, if it's completely absorbing. And so that would be a situation like this. Now, the reality in the real world is we have oftentimes a little bit of all of the above happening. For example, when we look at this white snow up here, this is reflecting pretty well."
Science,"So there's light that's coming from the sun, or maybe it's being reflected off of the clouds, or maybe it's getting through the clouds, and when it hits that snow, it gets reflected."
Science,"Now, the reason why we don't see a reflection the way that we see in this lake right over here is the snow reflects it in all different directions, but the fact that it's that bright color, in fact, you might need sunglasses to look at the snow, just as much as you need to look at the sky, is that it's reflecting most of the light."
Science,"But if you go down here where we see the trees, the same light from the sky is hitting it, but not as much light is coming back to our eye, and that's because this part of the mountain, it might be trees, it might be rock, it might be dirt, is absorbing more of the light, but it's still reflecting some. We can still see it a little bit. So this might be where most of it is getting absorbed, but a little bit of the light gets reflected, which we can see right over there."
Science,"And if we think about the water right over here, some of the light is probably making it through and probably refracting as it does so. Some of it is getting absorbed as it makes its way through the water. If this was a really deep lake, when you get to the bottom, it could be very, very dark. And then, as we talked about, it looks like a good bit is reflecting. When we look at the image that we see in the lake, it looks almost as bright as the real thing. So as I said, this is happening all around you."
Science,"In fact, when people make fancy computer graphics, they actually try to do exactly what the light would do in the real world to make an image for your eyes that look like the real world. And they're thinking exactly about this. How much gets through the substance? How much gets reflected, and how much gets absorbed? And as I mentioned, it's not just light waves that do this. Waves in general can do all of the above.."
Science,"An analog clock has the numbers in the hands and it's analog because the motion of those hands is continuous. They can sweep across the circle representing any of infinite times on that clock. For example, between 3:06 and 3:07, the minute hand is actually going to be at some point between those marks on the clock showing one of the infinitely possible times that the clock can represent. Compare that to a digital clock. A digital clock is only going to show you 3:06 or 3:07."
Science,It will never display any of the many fractional seconds between those two times. Digital only takes on certain discrete values and it has a finite number of those values. So an analog wave or signal will smoothly sweep across the infinitely many possible values it has while a digital wave or signal will only be at one of a number of discrete values. So the shape of the wave will be more square or step like. Let's check out an example so this makes a little more sense. I like music.
Science,"So we're gonna talk about sound. Sound is an analog signal or wave. So if we look at a graph of sound, volume over time, it's going to have a smooth continuous analog wave form, both the amplitude or the volume, and the frequency, what we hear as pitch are changing continuously between infinite possible values. All right, and that's because sound waves, the vibration of particles propagating through the air actually changes continuously."
Science,"The very first sound recording and reproduction technology imprinted that analog wave directly onto a material. For example, records imprint that sound wave into vinyl and cassettes imprint the sound wave onto tape. A major drawback of this technology is after the sound to play back exactly as it was recorded, that wave form needs to stay untouched, right? So think about scratching vinyl or smudging a cassette tape, that's directly deforming the wave."
Science,"So you'll never be able to reproduce the sound exactly as it was recorded. So, technology advanced and sound waves became digitized. Here's how. All right, so recall our analog sound wave. We have a smooth analog wave that's taking on any number of infinitely possible values within this range. In order to digitize this wave, we're going to ascribe numbers to the amplitude at different points, all right? Watch this magic. So we go over here and make a scale."
Science,"So we're breaking up the amplitudes into discrete possibilities. Then we can go through the wave and at specific points of the wave measure what is the amplitude based on that scale. So over here, we're at the first point of the scale. At this peak, we're at the second point of our scale. Then the first, the third, the second, the fourth, back down to the first."
Science,"Now that we have this way broken up into levels, right? We can ascribe the numbers and we effectively turn this analog wave into a set of numbers, one, two, one, three, two, four, one. Our wave has been digitized. Now that digitize wave can be played back through a speaker to recreate the analog wave. As long as the sampling happens at a quick enough rate, humans can't tell the difference."
Science,"All right, so the digitization of waves is all about ascribing specific numbers to some of those mechanical properties of the wave. The important thing here is that now that the wave has been digitized, the digitized sound wave can be reliably stored, processed, and communicated with computers."
Science,"So some information is lost in translation, but once the wave is digitized, it's quality will never degrade, okay? And that allows for a lot more reliable technology because the wave is represented with numbers instead of it being physically imprinted on some material."
Science,"So humans prefer to store information like sound digitally, and there are ways to turn analog signals, which can represent any of infinite possible values into digital information, which is useful because information is stored only at a number of discreet or separate levels.."
Science,"So whether you're trying to transmit an analog signal or a digital signal it really is about how do you communicate numbers using some type of signal. And as an example, let's say that you are trying to communicate the number 24 to someone. Well, one way to do it is as an analog signal. You could have, as time goes on, maybe this is some type of voltage across a wire."
Science,"And if you put that voltage right at what the other person receiving it could interpret it as 24, well then you would transmit it and they might, if they get this nice clean signal, see it as a 24. Now the problem with analog signals is what happens when you have interference. So let's say this is a really long wire that you're transmitting it over or you're transmitting it using radio waves, and there's a lot of bad weather or other types of interference."
Science,"And so on the receiving end even though you transmit something that looks like this, that is a clear 24, the other person might get something like this. And so this isn't obvious that is a 24 anymore. It goes between 20 and 30, and this could be interpreted as static or a garbled up message or just doesn't sound as clean depending on what the 24 is trying to represent, or the image isn't as clear, if this is representing say the lightness or the brightness of a pixel."
Science,"Now the other option is to convert that 24 into binary. So 24 can be represented in binary as 1 1 0 0 0. Now we have other videos on Khan Academy that explain how to convert back and forth between our decimal system that has 10 digits, zero through nine, and the binary system, which has two digits, zero and one."
Science,"But in case you're curious, and you don't have to understand this to know the difference between analog and digital signals and when they might be useful, this first place is the ones place just as you're used to. But instead of this being the tens place, this is the twos place. Instead of this being the hundreds place, this is the forth place. Instead of this being the thousands place, this is the eights place. And instead of that being the ten thousandths place, that's the sixteens place."
Science,"So one way to think about it, 1 1 0 0 0 means 1/16 and 1/8. And if you add those together, you would get 24. What would that actually look like as a signal? Well, it could look something like this. Where the person interpreting it knows that over this first time period whatever voltage you're getting, that tells you your first digit, that over the next time, period whatever voltage you're getting tells you the second digit, and so on and so forth. So this would be 1 1 0 0 0."
Science,"Now, why is this useful? Well, let's think about the situation where all of a sudden there's interference again. Now with the interference, you could still interpret this exactly as 1 1 0 0 0. Remember the person receiving the signal or the system receiving the signal is just trying to determine whether it's getting a one or a zero. So even though this is being perturbed right over here, it's clear that we are at a one. We know that it would not be a 0.9 or 1.1. It has to be either one or zero."
Science,"So it's clear that over this part right over here, you're getting a one, and then over here you're getting three zero. So they would be able to interpret it as 1 1 0 0 0, which is once again exactly 24.."
Science,"I have Iman Howard here, who manages our STEM content. Welcome, Iman, and why should folks care about middle school biology? - Biology is the study of life. And so, in this course, it really answers why are things the way they are, why do you look the way they do, why do I look the way I do, and how every organism on Earth has a really special purpose and a special trait. And based on these traits, it helps them interact with their environment. We even talk about energy."
Science,"And energy can't be created and it can't be destroyed. It actually cycles as matter through an ecosystem. And it even has this really cool chemical reactions called photosynthesis, where plants use light energy from the sun and they make their own food, which is insane. I think about organisms like the gorilla that are super-big and strong and they don't go and eat a cow. They go and eat plants because that's like getting energy right from the source. And then finally, we talk about evolution."
Science,"Based on our traits, how have we changed over time? And how some of our natural traits were selected by the environment that create those changes or even how humans, we have something called artificial selection, which explains why your dog's so cute. Whether it's 100 pounds or five pounds, we did that."
Science,"What do you think's cool about it, Sal? - Oh, well, you know, biology's trying to answer, I mean, to your point, the questions of life, which we still don't understand a lot about but like what makes us us and to realize that we don't exist as human beings in isolation. We're part of an ecosystem. We're part of a story, a narrative that's been going on for millions and billions of years."
Science,"The fact that we're made up of trillions of cells, each of them with DNA that can describe who we are, how did all of this complexity come about? This is maybe the most mind-blowing topic that we're really at just the beginning of this journey. So I think folks are gonna be really, really excited to or it's gonna be really interesting to see all of the things that they get to learn. - Well, let's dig in. (enthusiastic chiming)."
Science,"Now I know that for me, at least, I had a great time playing with toy building blocks, and creating things out of them. I used blocks of different shapes and sizes to make all kinds of things like houses, cars, even spaceships, and airplanes. You're probably thinking, what does this have to do with cells? Well, cells are considered the building blocks of life. Like my blocks, cells can come in a variety of shapes, and they have different features too."
Science,"They can also stand alone, or they can come together to build something larger. So let's dive deeper into this fascinating topic of cells. So all living things, or organisms, like you, me, your pet dog, the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, all organisms are made of these basic units called cells. Take this moss plant, for example, if we zoom way in, we can see that it's actually made up of many smaller units. These units are cells."
Science,"Each cell contains a flurry of activity, as it works to carry out the functions that keep the organism alive. In fact, cells are the smallest unit that can carry out all the tasks necessary for life. For instance, all cells can take up nutrients and water, get rid of waste, use energy, and interact with the things around them in their environment. These functions, plus many others that cells carry out, are what make life possible. There are many different kinds of cells."
Science,"For instance, take a look at these cells that make up an onion's outer skin, or these really cool red blood cells, or even these bacterial cells. This type of bacteria is called e-coli, which you might've heard can be a safety hazard found in our food. So cells are fascinating to look at, but we generally can't see them with our eyes alone. Most cells are so small that we need a microscope to see them. In fact, all of these pictures of cells here were taken with the aid of microscopes."
Science,"And something else that I find really cool is that some organisms are made up of only a single cell, while others are made up of many cells. So organisms that are made up of one cell are called unicellular, and organisms that are made up of many cells are called multicellular. Uni telling us that there is only one cell, and multi telling us that there are many cells. So an example of a unicellular organism would be the e-coli bacteria that I mentioned a minute ago."
Science,"Each bacterium is a single cell that's responsible for taking in nutrients, reproducing, and doing all the things that it needs to stay alive. So an example of a multicellular organism would be you, me, or most any other organism that you can see with the naked eye. And the cells of multicellular organisms are often specialized to carry out specific functions. So for example, some cells help the organism absorb nutrients, while others transmit information, or defend against bacteria and viruses."
Science,"So going back to our comparison between building blocks and cells, specialized cells are like different building blocks of different sizes, shapes, and colors. And these different blocks can come together to build something larger, like this airplane here. Similarly, cells with different structures and functions come together to make something larger, an organism like this adorable kitten right here. So to sum up cells and organisms, today, we learned that cells are the smallest unit of life."
Science,"We talked about how all organisms are made up of cells, and that organisms can be unicellular or multicellular. So I hope that now you have a good understanding of cells and organisms, as well as a new perspective about building blocks, not the toys, but the cells that make up life itself.."
Science,"We need some chicken bones to give the broth that distinct chicken flavor, some noodles to add that starchy component, carrots and onions to give some sweetness and color. And of course, salt and pepper to provide seasoning. All of these ingredients would come together to make our chicken noodle soup the comfort food that so many people love, but this video is supposed to be about cells. You know, those tiny things that make up all living things on earth."
Science,"So why am I telling you about chicken soup? Well, just like how each ingredient in chicken soup adds something unique to the soup's overall flavor and texture, a cell's different parts add something unique and necessary for the overall functioning of the cell. So, let's take a look at some of the structures inside a cell and see how their functions come together to allow cells to carry out all the processes of life. So let's explore the parts of a cell starting with the cell's surface."
Science,"Cells are separated from their outside environment by a cell membrane. You can think of the cell membrane like a fortress gate, because it regulates what comes into and out of the cell, and contained within the cell is a jelly-like substance that fills out the cell and contains its internal parts, this jelly and all the structures within it make up the cell cytoplasm. Unlike chicken soup, the cell parts in the cytoplasm are not just floating around."
Science,"Instead, they're organized and held in place by an internal structural network. Some of the parts contained within the cytoplasm are called organelles. So what exactly are organelles? Well, organelles are small compartments in the cell that have different structures and functions. The word organelle basically means, mini organ."
Science,"And just like how our bodies are made up of different organs that work together to help us stay alive, cells contain different organelles that work together to get things done inside the cell. For example, these jellybean shaped organelles here are little energy producing factories called mitochondria. So mitochondria use chemical reactions to break down sugar molecules in order to release energy that the cell can use for other tasks. Another really amazing organelle is the nucleus."
Science,"You can think of the nucleus as the information database of the cell. It contains DNA which includes the cell's genes. Genes are special instructions that the cell uses to carry out its functions. Moving over to a plant cell, we can see these green organelles called chloroplasts. You might remember that plants carry out photosynthesis. Well, chloroplasts are the organelle's responsible for this process. Plants need food to live, just like animals do."
Science,"And chloroplasts use photosynthesis to produce sugars that plant cells use as food. Plant cells also have a layer outside their cell membrane called the cell wall, which helps provide structure for the cell. So as you can see, there are so many different parts that make up a single cell. There are many, many organelles present in cells, way more than the handful I mentioned in this video. And what's even more mind blowing is that these diagrams are only simplified versions of what cells actually look like."
Science,"And just to give you an idea, here's a picture of what a real cell looks like. So when we're talking about cells and using these diagrams as references, keep in mind that these pictures are only simplified models of the real thing. To wrap up this video on cell parts, let's revisit our delicious bowl of chicken noodle soup that I mentioned at the beginning. Each ingredient that we added had a unique function that contributed to the soup's taste and texture."
Science,"And similarly, our cell's ingredients, its organelles and structures, each contribute a unique function that helps the cell carry out all the tasks necessary for life. So the next time you find yourself in front of a bowl of noodle soup, just imagine that you're eating one enormous cell. Now, isn't that something to noodle on?."
Science,"What's more, a lion and a fern not only look completely different, they also function differently. But what if I told you that if we zoomed in really close and compared the lion's cells with the fern's cells, they'd actually share many similarities? An animal cell and a plant cell have several common features as well as a few key differences. In this video, we're going to spot the similarities and the differences between the two types of cells, and talk about their functions inside the cells."
Science,"So, first off, let's take a look at some cell models. Here on the left is an animal cell, and on the right is a plant cell. First, let's try and identify the things that both animal and plant cells share in common. If you recall, both animal and plant cells have a cell membrane, which acts like a gate to control what enters and leaves the cell."
Science,"Animal cells and plant cells also have this jelly-like substance called the cytosol, which contains organelles or small compartments with specific functions inside the cell. Animal and plant cells share several common organelles, two of which include the nucleus and the mitochondria. The nucleus within each cell type serves as an information database to store the cell's genes, while the mitochondria act as factories to break down sugars and release energy that the cells can use."
Science,"So now that we've identified some features found in both kinds of cells, let's look closer to spot the fundamental differences between animal and plant cells. As you can see in this diagram, plant cells have an additional layer of material that surrounds the cell membrane. This is called a cell wall, which makes the plant cell more structured and stiff. Think of a celery stalk compared to a raw piece of chicken or fish. The animal muscle tissue is floppy while the celery stalk is firm."
Science,"That's cell walls in action. Also, plant cells have these special organelles called chloroplasts, which are what give plants, like the fern we saw, their green color. Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis, which is how plants make their own food in the form of sugars. If the word sugar rings a bell, you're on the right track because I mentioned earlier that mitochondria are responsible for breaking down sugars."
Science,"In plant cells, chloroplasts and mitochondria are like good buddies that help each other and work together. Chloroplasts make sugars through photosynthesis and mitochondria convert the sugars into energy that, ultimately, the plant can use. Both cell walls and chloroplasts are found in plant cells but not animal cells, such as the ones in you and me. And luckily for you and me, this means we aren't green."
Science,"In summary, we just identified several similarities and differences in our comparison of animal and plant cells. While both cell types have a cell membrane, cytosol, a nucleus, and mitochondria, plant cells have a cell wall that makes them stiff and rigid, think about celery stalks, and they have chloroplasts, which makes sugars and give plants their green color. All of these are just a handful of the similarities and differences between plant and animal cells."
Science,"As you go forward in your biology journey, you'll probably learn about a lot more. But the differences that we've covered are a big part of what makes plant and animal cells so distinct and unique from each other. These differences are why we don't see green lions that photosynthesize using chloroplasts or floppy raw veggies with cell membranes but no cell walls."
Science,"- Now I hope that you have a clear understanding of the different cell parts in both animal and plant cells, and that spotting the differences between the two will be easy breezy.."
Science,"All these body parts are made up of cells, which as you might remember, are the smallest units of life. And it's so amazing that trillions of cells, without thoughts or intentions of their own, can come together to form something as complex as the human body. To help us understand how this occurs, we have to understand how the body is organized. The human body has a hierarchical organization, meaning it's made up of nested layers, each one more complex than the last."
Science,"In this case, four different layers make up this hierarchy. Cells, which make up tissues. Tissues, which make up organs. Organs, which make up organ systems. And finally organ systems, which help the human body function as a whole. So let's start with cells and tissues. Cells are the smallest unit of life, and the most basic level of organization in the human body. In the human body, not all cells look or work the same. Instead, they're specialized to carry out different functions."
Science,"After cells, the next level of organization is tissues. A tissue is a collection of similar, specialized cells. And all of the cells that make up a tissue are like a team. They work together to ensure the tissue works properly. For instance, this image shows a section of the type of epithelial tissue that lines the inside of your mouth. This particular tissue is made up of epithelial cells, which are specialized to help protect your mouth from wear and tear."
Science,"So the next time you're eating a pointy tortilla chip, remember how important this epithelial tissue is. Next up are organs and organ systems. So organs are structures that are made up of multiple different types of tissues, which all work together to help the organ function. And an organ system is a group of organs that work together to carry out complex functions for the body. For instance, the lungs shown here in the diagram are made up of several tissue types that help them expand and contract."
Science,"These tissue types include epithelial tissue, which is the same type of tissue we talked about earlier in the mouth, and connective tissue. And these tissues work together so that the lungs can carry out their role in the respiratory system, which is the organ system that allows us to respire or breathe. The respiratory system is made up of multiple organs, including the lungs, the trachea, the nose and the diaphragm. When we breathe, our diaphragm which is this muscle right here, contracts."
Science,"Air is pulled through our nose and trachea, and into our lungs. Here, gas exchange happens and our bodies take in oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. Then our diaphragm relaxes and we exhale. The respiratory system, and other organ systems in the body, carry out specific functions that work together to keep us alive. And they do this mostly without us even realizing it."
Science,"So it might get a little tricky to remember how all four levels of organization cells, tissues, organs and organ systems relate to each other. I like to think of these four different levels, almost like the Russian nesting dolls that fit one inside another. With cells being the smallest doll on the inside. So cells make up tissues. Tissues make up organs. And organs make up organ systems. All of these components come together to make up the human body."
Science,So I hope you've learned more about how our body's organization helps us thrive and stay alive. So now use your brain to tell your muscular system to move your arm and give yourself a pat on the back. Because your body and its organized hierarchical system is really awesome..
Science,"If you remember, our bodies are made up of multiple complex organ systems that work together to perform all different kinds of functions. Today, let's talk specifically about the nervous system, which is an organ system that allows us to sense and respond to our environment. To begin, the nervous system contains specialized cells and cell parts, called sensory receptors, which are able to pick up signals from the environment. These signals are called stimuli, or stimulus if you're talking about just one."
Science,"Stimuli can come in many different forms. For instance, mechanical stimuli are physical in nature, and are involved with our senses of touch and hearing. You can strum a guitar, feeling the strings against your fingertips, and listening to the unique tones it produces as the strings vibrate. Those are all mechanical stimuli. Chemical stimuli are made up of molecules, and are involved with our senses of smell and taste. To illustrate an example, imagine eating a tasty bowl of chicken noodle soup."
Science,"As you spoon mouthfuls of soup into your mouth, your taste and olfactory receptors are flooded with molecules that signal the qualities of the food you're eating. These molecular signals are chemical stimuli. And in this case, the molecules from the chicken noodle soup convey that the food you're eating is savory, and extremely delicious. Lastly, electromagnetic stimuli are involved with our sense of sight, and include the light that comes into our eyes every day."
Science,"The sunlight that makes you squint, the traffic lights you see on the street, and the vibrant and diverse colors all around you. These are just a few examples of electromagnetic stimuli in the form of light. So then what happens after sensory receptors detect stimuli? Well, once a sensory receptor receives the information, it passes this information along nerve cells. Here's a picture of a nerve cell, which is specialized to transmit information in the form of electrical signals."
Science,"These signals are transmitted along nerves to the brain, which is then responsible for processing, or organizing sensory information from different sensory receptors. After processing the information, the brain can elicit a response, and also store the information in the form of a memory for future use. For example, imagine you're playing catch with friends in a park. Your sensory receptors pick up information as you watch the ball come towards you, and feel the wind on your skin."
Science,"Signals from these receptors travel along nerve cells to your brain, where all these different signals are organized. Then your brain elicits a response, such as moving to just the right spot, and putting your hands out to catch the ball. And the brain also stores a memory, perhaps remembering playing catch as a fun activity that you'd wanna do again."
Science,"You can almost think of this flow of information from a stimulus to sensing, to processing, and finally, to eliciting a response or storing information, like a complex relay race. Sensory receptors pick up message in the form of stimuli, and pass this information along to nerves, and to the brain. Only in this relay, the end result at the finish line is a response to the stimulus and information storage. So to summarize, today, we talked about how our bodies sense, and respond to the environment."
Science,"Information is transferred from a stimulus to a sensory receptor, to nerve cells, and finally to the brain, where processing occurs. Whether we're aware of it or not, our nervous system is working at rapid-fire speed every day to provide us with the information our bodies need to sense what's in our environment, and thrive in it.."
Science,"This happens when parent organisms reproduce to form offspring. During reproduction, organisms pass their genetic information on to their offspring. This genetic information provides blueprints for how the offspring will grow and develop and it's how traits get passed on from one generation to the next. There are two main ways organisms on earth reproduce. This is through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction. Let's start off by breaking down asexual reproduction first."
Science,"In asexual reproduction, only one parent is involved in producing offspring. Due to this, the offspring will inherit all of their genes from that single parent. This means that asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to their parent, or in other words, they have the same collection of genes. Various kinds of microorganisms, plants, and even animals are able to reproduce asexually. An example of asexual reproduction in microorganisms can be seen in bacteria."
Science,"This is due to their use of a specific type of asexual reproduction called binary fission. During this process, a single bacteria cell grows, copies its genes, and divides into two identical cells, kind of like a copy machine. Plants are able to reproduce asexually too. For example, some plants grow their offspring off of themselves. In fact, in many succulents, you can see baby plants growing off of their parent plant."
Science,"These babies have the same genes as their parent plant and can grow on their own if you remove them and plant them in soil. Finally, and interestingly, there are various animals that can reproduce asexually. One example is seen in starfish or sea stars. Some species of starfish can split into multiple parts that then grow into new starfish and, since they have the same genes, each new starfish is a clone of its original. Now that we've covered asexual reproduction, let's move on to sexual reproduction."
Science,"Unlike asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction involves two parents producing an offspring together instead of one. This is important because it means that the offspring will inherit half of their genes from one parent and half of their genes from the other. Because of this, a sexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically distinct or have a different combination of genes compared to either parent."
Science,"With this, because of the way the genes are passed on, there are tons of different combinations of genes that can be received from the two parents. In other words, this means that sexual reproduction creates offspring that show a lot of genetic variation between their siblings. To better understand this, let's take a look at my own dogs. They're brother and sister, so they share the same parents, which I've drawn here. As you've probably noticed, my dogs look pretty different from each other."
Science,"One of the most notable differences though is how one of them received genes from this parent that gave them markings above their eyes that kind of looked like eyebrows while the other did not. And while it's easy to spot genetic differences, like my dog's eyebrows, genetic variation goes way deeper than dog's fur. It's what makes sexual reproduced organisms genetically distinct from each other and gives the building blocks to who they are."
Science,"And with that, you now know the difference between asexual and sexual reproduction. Let's do a quick overview of what you've learned today. Living organisms reproduce to create offspring through either asexual or sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction involves only one parent meaning the parent and offspring will have identical genes."
Science,"Sexual reproduction involves two parents and results in offspring that are genetically unique compared to either parent and this all goes to show how fantastically unique life on earth is. Though organisms may differ in the ways that they've been able to reproduce as seen in the examples between bacteria, succulents, starfish, and dogs, these organisms, as with all living things, share the ability to create more life just as all life has shared for billions of years here on this planet.."
Science,"One might be behaviors that increase the chances of an animal producing offspring. And we know that most animals that we study, not all, but most, reproduce via sexual reproduction. To do that, they need to mate with an individual of the opposite sex."
Science,"And that's why you see things like peacocks, where these very elaborate feathers are a way of signaling to members of the opposite sex, the peahens, that this peacock here has favorable traits, is attractive to the peahen, has good health, which signals to the peahen that by reproducing with this peacock, they're more likely to have reproductive success. They'll have healthier offspring, which are more likely to survive, which are more likely to then go on and reproduce."
Science,"And then assuming that animals are able to mate and able to reproduce, another behavior that you will see amongst animals that will increase the chances that their offspring will survive, and then be able to reproduce themselves is parental care, or behaviors that protect offspring from predators. You see that throughout the animal kingdom. Here are some emperor penguins taking care of their young baby penguin. Here is a mother grizzly bear taking care of her bears."
Science,"And here the parental care might be helping them find food, giving them food, training them, protecting them from other predators or from competitors in some way. And this isn't just amongst bears, and penguins, and potentially peacocks and peahens. It's all in service to, at least in some level, reproductive success.."
Science,"A plant that has more surviving offspring has a higher reproductive success. So one major strategy that plants use to increase their chances of reproduction is by leveraging animals for pollination. You have seen pollination. This is a picture of a bee gathering nectar from this flower, but as it gathers that nectar, pollen also gets attached to that bee."
Science,"So as that bee goes from flower to flower, from plant to plant, it's able to pollinate, it's able to take pollen from one plant and give it to another plant, allowing for that genetic mixing to occur and also to then have more plant reproduction. Now, once a plant is able to reproduce, we also need to think about how viable its offspring are going to be."
Science,"Are they in conditions where they are likely to succeed in living and then reproducing themselves? And here, a common strategy, or at least a category of strategies that plants use are known as seed dispersal. And it's really just trying to get the seeds in as many places as possible, potentially far away from the plant itself, to increase the chances that more of the seeds are going to be in places that are nutrient rich, where they can survive. And once again, you have likely seen this."
Science,"This is a dandelion plant and when a strong wind blows, these dandelion seeds catch the wind because they have these structures which are not that aerodynamic, which pull the seeds along and can transport them for even miles and miles. Many of these seeds aren't going to end up in useful places, but some of them might, and they might be in places where the future dandelion offspring are more likely to survive and then reproduce themselves. But seed dispersal also gets the help of animals."
Science,"This right over here is a picture of a bird eating fruit from a plant. And as that bird flies away and munches on that fruit, that seed might be dispersed, it might be thrown down hundreds of yards or even miles away from the original plant. In many cases, you might eat a fruit, and I am saying you, because we do this ourselves. You might eat, say, a watermelon or a papaya and a couple of seeds go down while you ate it."
Science,"And then later on, you or some other animal might poop it someplace where it might be a good place for that watermelon plant or that papaya plant to grow. So this was just an overview of some of the strategies that plants use, but it's important to realize that throughout nature, we see this idea of reproductive success over and over again, and in animals' behaviors or strategies for reproductive success, and here we saw plants' strategies for reproductive success.."
Science,"This can happen by a gust of wind, by animals spreading them, or even by someone blowing on the plant. When this happens, it seeds fly into the air and land on new spots on the ground. From there, the seeds can grow into new dandelions, starting the whole cycle over. But why do dandelions do this? Why do they turn into puff balls? Why are they yellow? If they don't have brains, how do they seem to know when to release their seeds? These are all complicated questions."
Science,"But to begin answering them, we can talk about what influences the growth and development of dandelions and in turn all living things. So what determines how a dandelion will grow? Its genes and its environment. Let's take a moment to review what genes are. Genes make up the hereditary material inside an organism cells. Genes provide the information about what traits an organism has. So the reason that our dandelion has yellow pedals and develops fluffy white seed heads lies within its genes."
Science,"Any influence genes have on the way an organism grows is called a genetic factor. So if one dandelion has more seeds than another as a result of which version of a certain gene it has, we can say that the difference in seed number is due to a genetic factor. The other major influence on how a dandelion grows is its environment. But what makes up an organism's environment? The environment is the set of conditions an organism is exposed to during its life."
Science,"For a dandelion, this includes temperature, how much light and water it gets, and which nutrients are present in the soil where it grows. Any influence the environment has on an organism's growth is called an environmental factor. So if one dandelion plant is exposed to more sunlight than another and grows bigger, as a result, we can say that the difference is due to an environmental factor. But plants aren't the only living organisms that are motivated by these factors."
Science,"Animals are also influenced by their genes and environment. For example, let's look at dogs. Dogs come in many different shapes, sizes, colors, and each have their own unique features. We can see this when looking at different breeds, like pugs which are small with squishy faces, and golden retrievers, which are large with flowing locks of golden fur. These traits are largely determined by which genes each breed of dog has, or in other words, by genetic factors."
Science,"But dogs are also influenced by environmental factors too. For instance, how much food they get as they grow helps determine their size, and what they learn from other dogs, and from people help determine their behaviors. Like when you teach your dog a new trick. And now you know how organisms are influenced by genetics and their environment when it comes to growth and development. Let's do a quick review of what you've learned today."
Science,"First, there are two main factors that influence an organism's growth, these are genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors are the genes the organism gets from its parent or parents. While environmental factors are the conditions and organism is exposed to as it grows. These factors show that all living organisms have a couple things in common even dogs and dandelions."
Science,"So while our interactions with them may differ like how you can't teach a dandelion to sit like you can with a dog, both organisms experience growth and development through their own unique genes and environments.."
Science,"I give my plants micronutrients, and maybe some fertilizer. But I don't give them food in the same way that I would give my dog who eats multiple times a day. With plants, I just put them in the soil, water them regularly, and watch them grow. How do they do it? Well, they use a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a scientific term to describe how certain living things use energy from sunlight to live and grow."
Science,"Many different kinds of plants, algae, and various single-celled organisms are able to carry out this amazing process. Today, let's describe photosynthesis using tomatoes. So here you see a young tomato plant, similar to the ones I have in my own garden. Let's name it Planty. First, let's start off by looking at Planty's immediate surroundings. The soil Planty is growing in contains water and the air surrounding Planty contains molecules of carbon dioxide."
Science,"These two compounds are the starting materials or inputs that Planty needs in order to carry out photosynthesis. Now, let's take a look at the weather forecast. Well, it looks like it's gonna be a sunny day today. So when the sun shines on the earth, it sends out energy in the form of light. This energy is essential for Planty to be able to carry out photosynthesis. Next, let's take a closer look at Planty, because Planty's cells are hiding a secret of their own."
Science,"Inside Planty's cells are microscopic structures that help Planty carry out photosynthesis. These structures are called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain green pigment molecules called chlorophyll. It is actually within these molecules that the sun's energy is captured for use during photosynthesis. Interestingly, chlorophyll is where leaves get their green color. To help you remember, think of chlorophyll like this: chloro means green and phyll means leaf."
Science,"So when you put them together, you get green leaf. Okay, so now we know that carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight are required for photosynthesis to occur. And we know that in plants like Planty, photosynthesis happens in the chloroplast with the help of chlorophyll. Next, let's take a look at what happens during the process of photosynthesis itself."
Science,"When the sunlight reaches Planty's chloroplast, its energy is used to rearrange the atoms in the carbon dioxide and water molecules through a series of chemical reactions. The outputs of these reactions are oxygen molecules and sugars. These sugars are vital to Planty's survival because they are used as a source of chemical energy that helps Planty live and grow. In other words, they're Planty's food. Planty can do a few things with the sugars made during photosynthesis."
Science,"It can break the sugars down to get usable energy right away, or it can store the sugar molecules for later use. If Planty stores the sugar molecules, it can then use them as a source of energy in the future. This means that Planty can grow even when the sun isn't shining. Planty can also use the sugar molecules to build larger molecules such as cellulose that make up the structure of Planty itself."
Science,"In this way, Planty can grow bigger and bigger with very little help from me; all thanks to the process of photosynthesis. Planty's other output, oxygen, is released into the atmosphere. This is really cool because it provides organisms in the ecosystem, including us, with oxygen. So thanks Planty and other photosynthetic organisms for giving us the oxygen we need to breathe. And that, my friends, is photosynthesis. So next time you're in a garden, I want you to think about this."
Science,"All the plant structures you can see, such as stems, leaves, and even the fruits and vegetables that we eat are made up mostly of the atoms that were once a part of the starting materials of photosynthesis. With the help of a little sunlight, the plants made their own food and grew bigger, taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and releasing oxygen back in for us to breathe. And on that note, I think I should go outside and give my own garden some water. See you later.."
Science,"And so if you think about it that way, then it's likely reasonable to assume that because the adult's body is bigger, it has more molecules and/or larger molecules than the baby's body. And so this means that there are some molecules in this baby and those molecules are interacting and combining with some other source of molecules in the world in order to become this adult. And generally speaking, the source of those molecules is going to be our diet, AKA our food."
Science,"And to kind of understand this, we can actually make a comparison here between food and wood. So what I mean by that is that the molecules in food interact with the molecules on our bodies in two primary ways. The first is as a source of molecular building blocks, or in other words, molecules the body can use to build new structures. And the second is going to be as a source of molecules for fuel, much like a campfire or firewood, like what we have here."
Science,"But in order to understand how and why this can happen, we need to briefly discuss the molecular basis of food. So what are the molecules in food? Let me introduce you. All right, 'cause generally speaking, food is made up of these three classes of molecules. First up are fats, then we've got sugars, and finally some protein. I'd imagine some of these sound reasonably familiar. These molecules are made basically from just a few elements. So this is color-coded and the gray balls are carbon."
Science,"The white ones are hydrogen. Those are the big ones. So most of life's molecules are made mostly of carbon and hydrogen. But we've also got oxygen here in red and nitrogen in blue, those are the other two big ones. And every now and then, we'll also find small amounts of some other elements, like this sulfur here in yellow. But the super interesting part here is that these are actually the same exact elements that make up most of the cells in your body."
Science,"So you may notice on this right-hand side the same colors is what we have on the left. So this is where the whole Molecular Lumber thing comes in. Our cells can take food and break it down into small building blocks and then use those building blocks in order to build new structures in our body. So is how we grow. This is how babies become adults. Turns out, we actually are what we eat. It's pretty amazing. All right, but before we get too excited, let's bring it in."
Science,"So let's switch gears for a second here to talk about the other side of things because I told you before that food is like wood. And we can use wood to build new structures, sure. But when we need to, we can also burn wood to get energy. So we can start a campfire. And if we do, we know that we're gonna get some energy in the form of light, we'll get some energy in the form of heat, and maybe some other things like sound."
Science,"And food is actually the same way, and so we can take those same food molecules that we broke down before to get building blocks and instead use them as fuel to generate cellular energy. And then we can use that cellular energy to fuel all of the building that we just talked about. And likewise, if our cells work together, which they do, they can use this energy to do things like running, thinking, and all the other things that we humans do. All right."
Science,"Let's step back just one more time because what we'll see is that these two processes that we've just described, so food is lumber and food is fuel actually explain so much of life. So this is not just us. Every living thing on this planet is doing this. So you feed your dog to fuel his or her molecular construction projects as well."
Science,"So right there and then, we've already kind of answered our question from before, which, reminder, was: how do people go from small to big? So what's happening is that this baby becomes an adult by eating food, milk, formula, gushy stuff, I don't know, whatever babies eat. And some of the molecules in that food will be used as fuel to generate energy, and then some of that energy will be used to combine food molecules with molecules in the baby to build up a larger baby, AKA an adult."
Science,"All right, I hope that helps. Let's wrap it here. See you in the next one.."
Science,"But how exactly does that food give us energy? How does something like an apple or a piece of chocolate get converted into something our bodies can use? The answer to this question can be found in a process called cellular respiration. Which is how organisms get their energy from food. In other words, cellular respiration helps make life possible. It's happening right now in your cells and in mine, in my little brothers pet hamster cells and in the cells of the tree outside the window."
Science,"It's providing all of us with the energy that we need to function. So let's dive into this process to find out more about how it works. Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions that happen in an organized way inside our cells. It's these chemical reactions that result in an overall release of energy that our bodies can use. Although cellular respiration involves many chemical reactions, this entire process for plants and animals can be summarized here by this equation."
Science,"On the left side of this equation are the inputs; Glucose, which is a type of sugar, and oxygen. Glucose comes from our food and oxygen comes from the air we breathe. The right side of this equation shows the outputs, carbon dioxide and water. The air in the middle shows that during the process of cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen molecules are are broken apart and their atoms are rearranged to eventually form carbon dioxide and water."
Science,"This whole process releases energy, similar to how firewood releases energy as it burns. Also, no atoms are lost during cellular respiration. You can see the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow, for example, six carbon atoms on both sides. It's similar to how you could take apart a brick house and use those bricks to build something else, like a bridge. You're not throwing away any of the bricks, but instead you're creating something new out of them."
Science,"So we know that cellular respiration involves a series of chemical reactions, but where in the cell do these steps happen? To find out, let's walk through the process together. After eating, your food is broken down into small molecules during digestion. These small molecules which include glucose can enter your cells. Then cellular respiration can begin."
Science,"The first set of chemical reactions happen in the cytosol, which is the jelly-like fluid containing all of the cells organelles, and they involve glucose as an input. The rest of the reactions happen in mitochondria, with oxygen as an input and carbon dioxide and water as outputs. Together, these chemical reactions result in an overall release of energy. It might be a little mind boggling for you to think about how the food we eat provides the energy our bodies need to carry out all of lives processes."
Science,"And I know it was for me. After all, it's not every day you take a bite of an apple and wonder how that apple's molecules are rearranged inside your body. What's important to know though, is that cellular respiration is the way our cells get usable energy. Through cellular respiration, you and I get the energy that we need to do the things we want to do, including accomplishing our goals."
Science,"So, the next time you feel proud of your yourself for finishing a big hike or acing your biology quiz, make sure to thank your mitochondria.."
Science,"So first of all, a population is talking about the members of a specific species in an area. So for example, in this picture, we have a population of zebra. I have one zebra there, one zebra there, there might be some others that we can't see. In fact, there are likely to be. So, these are each members of a population of zebra. Now, we have other populations in this picture. We have a population of buffalo. These three are members of that population. We have a population of antelope."
Science,"In fact, there is a bunch of antelope in this picture. So, we have many members of that population. We even see some animals here in the background. I can't quite make out what they are, but that could be a different population. Let's say if those are elephants, they might be elephants the way I see them, but that could be members of a population of elephants. So if that is a population, what is a community? Well, a community is all of the living species that live in the same area."
Science,"So, we have a community of animals that is made up of populations of buffalo, of zebra, and of antelope. And I wanna make clear that the populations or when we're talking about the communities, we're not necessarily just talking about large animals like this. We could be talking about populations of mosquitoes. We could be talking about populations of fish in this pond, if there are any fish. We could have a population of a certain species of plant."
Science,"And likewise, when we're talking about communities, we're talking about collectively all of the living organisms together. Now, last but not least, what would be an ecosystem then? Well, an ecosystem is all of the living organisms plus all of the non-living things. So, the ecosystem that we see here would also include the water, it would also include the dirt, it would also include the air."
Science,"And organisms like those that we see right here are constantly interacting with both the living and nonliving parts of their environment. These interactions are how organisms get food, shelter, water, and warmth. These interactions are how organisms survive and produce offspring. So, let's get a little bit more practice with this idea of populations, communities, and ecosystems. And we will do that by looking at this picture right over here."
Science,"Pause this video and think about what are the populations here? Well, you might not know the name of all these different types of fish, but you can see that there's a population of this gold-colored fish right over here. There's also another population of this blue-colored fish. We could keep looking for other populations. It looks like there's a population of this silver-colored or I guess long-ish silver fish right over here. But once again, it's not just the fish."
Science,"There's a population of coral, there's populations of microorganisms that we can't see here. The community would be all of these living organisms that live close to each other. And we'll see, sometimes they compete with each other, sometimes they eat each other, but sometimes they help each other, Or sometimes they don't matter that much to each other. And we'll study that in a lot more detail."
Science,"And then the ecosystem includes all of the above plus the water, plus the oxygen that is in the water, plus the sand at the bottom of the ocean. So, I'll leave you there. Hopefully, you now have a sense of what biologists are talking about when they talk about populations, communities, and ecosystems.."
Science,"So it seems like over time, these zebra should just be able to keep multiplying until they fill up all of this land, similar for the buffalo, similar for the antelope. Why don't we see that? Pause this video and think about that. So let's start by thinking about what any organism, or a population of organisms, or a community of populations need to survive. Most animals that live on the surface, like these animals, need air, especially oxygen. Plants need carbon dioxide from the air. They need water."
Science,"They need a source of energy, which I will call food, or I could say it's energy here, because it's not always in the form of food as we might recognize it. And I guess if we think really basically, they need space in which to exist. Now, as I mentioned, there seems to be a lot of space here for the animals, so that doesn't seem to be the resource that is limiting their growth. So let's rule that out here."
Science,"Now, it's also clear that it seems like there's a fairly large amount of air here, more than enough air for these populations to grow, so that doesn't seem to be a resource that's somehow putting a maximum on how many of these organisms there are. It does not look like a limited resource, or a limiting resource. Now, what about water? Well, water does seem interesting here, because this watering hole does not seem like it's very deep. It does not seem like there's a lot of water here."
Science,"So this one could be what we would call a limited resource that is limiting population. Maybe if they had more and more offspring, there just wouldn't be enough water for any member of a population, and then of course the populations would be competing with each other as well, because they all need the same water to drink."
Science,"Now, what about food? Well, you might recognize that zebra, or antelope, or buffalo, they tend to graze on grasses, and there are some grasses over here, but we also see that a lot of the grass is dead or dried out, and there's just a lot of areas with dirt here. So it looks like the food and energy is also a limiting resource."
Science,"And we have to remind ourselves there's populations of different types of grasses, and why aren't they spreading more? Well, from the perspective of a plant, it looks like the air and space is for sure abundant, and even energy in the form of sunlight is abundant based on this picture, so it's probably water is the limited resource, which is keeping us from having more plants and grasses in this picture. We can imagine a scenario in which it rains a lot."
Science,"There's a lot of water, water is abundant, then all of the different types of populations of grasses are able to expand, and then there's more than enough food and water for these animals to keep reproducing. In that case, space might become an issue. But the important thing to realize here is that all organisms need resources in order to survive and in order to multiply and reproduce. Populations of many different species are often competing for those resources."
Science,"Like the water here, that will tend to put a limit on how much these populations can grow. And the limit on one population can affect another. As we said, if you had more water, you could have more grass, which will allow them for more food and energy for these other populations.."
Science,"Well, one limited resource that these animals need to survive is water. There's only a limited amount in this watering hole over here and so you could imagine there is competition not just amongst the members of a population let's say between the zebra but also between members of different species, between different populations in a community. The zebras are not just competing for water with each other but also with these antelope or with these buffalo over here. There might also be competition for food."
Science,"It doesn't seem like there's a lot of grass to eat for all of these animals that like to graze on grass. So now let's move on to predation. Predation is when one organism eats another organism usually to its own benefit. Do you see any predation happening here? Well, we don't see any of these animals chasing and killing each other."
Science,"There might be other animals like lions offscreen that might hunt and kill and eat these animals right over here but we know that these animals do eat grass and as I said, it's not just about hunting and killing and eating from one animal to another. It could be one organism to another. So the eating of the grass by these animals could actually be considered a form of predation especially if it kills the grass."
Science,"A more obvious form of predation is this brown bear here that has gotten the salmon out of this river. It is clearly hunting and killing the salmon for its benefit and it is likely that each of these bears are in competition with other bears for this limited resource. So last but not least, let's think a little bit about mutualism. Mutualism happens when two organisms benefit from interacting with each other."
Science,"Right over here, we have these starlings that actually hang out on this buffalo and pick lice and ticks off the buffalo's fur. This is mutualism because both parties benefit. The starlings are able to get food and the buffalo no longer have these parasites, these things that are living off of the buffalo sucking its blood out of its body and also probably not itching as much. Now, based on how I just described it, there's not just mutualism here."
Science,"There's also predation because these birds are actually hunting and killing the lice and the ticks on the buffalo's body. Now, related to being a predator is another word known as being a parasite and that's what the lice and the ticks are doing where they're sucking the blood of the buffalo but they're not considered predators. They're more parasites because they don't kill the buffalo. They're just taking some resources away from it. So I'll leave you there."
Science,"I encourage you when you look at nature, when you go to a park next time, when you go watch a documentary, I encourage you to think about how competition, predation and mutualism is happening in an ecosystem that you are seeing or that you're a part of.."
Science,"It might have something to do with photosynthesis, which we go into a lot of depth in other videos, but this is a process where you have carbon dioxide from the air in conjunction with water that primarily is coming from the soil, and it uses energy from the sun so I'll just draw that in, these yellow squiggles coming from the sun, in order to do two things. The plant is going to be building itself using the matter in the carbon dioxide and the water while also expelling oxygen as a byproduct."
Science,"And this matter that the plant is able to take from its environment with photosynthesis is used to both become the structure of the plant and a store of energy in the form of sugars. Now, animals like you and me, we get our energy by then eating these plants. And how do we unlock that energy? Well, that's where this oxygen is really useful."
Science,"That's why we need to breathe oxygen because by breathing the oxygen, we can essentially do photosynthesis in reverse, and we can break down this matter, these sugars, that we're getting from plants. So all of this biomass is coming from essentially water from the soil and carbon dioxide, and energy from the sun is used essentially put it together. There might be a few other nutrients that are also coming from the environment, like the soil, but primarily the water and the carbon dioxide.."
Science,"And we're going to see that in a second. And then when we talk about energy, it's the energy that your cells need to be alive, the energy you need to be alive, to not just exist, but to do things, to think, to move. And so this food web essentially describes that. As we've talked about in other videos, in most ecosystems, the great majority of the energy in an ecosystem comes from the sun. So what we have here is the sun produces energy."
Science,"It travels to Earth, and then you have organisms, which we would call producers, that are able to take that light energy from the sun, and then take atoms and molecules from its environment, things like carbon dioxide in the air, things like water, and other nutrients. And it's able to construct itself using that energy from the sun. Now, when it constructs itself, it not only gives it structure, but it's also able to store energy. And right over here, we have several producers depicted."
Science,"We have this tree here, which is able to do photosynthesis. We have the grass here that's able to do photosynthesis, and it's not just plants. You have things like algae, and other microorganisms that are able to be producers. But then we have things like this bunny, and this bunny is not able to harness energy from the sun by itself. In order for it to get its energy and its matter, it needs to eat one of these producers, probably some of this grass."
Science,"And so we would call this bunny right over here, this rabbit, we would call it a consumer. And it is a consumer, you could think of it as both matter and energy. When it eats that plant, those atoms are then able to make up the bunny. It will poop out a little bit, so some of the matter might end up right over here."
Science,"But then also there is energy that is stored in those molecules, and that rabbit can use that energy to exist and live, but as it does it, it does release some of the energy in the form of heat. And actually, even producers need to use energy in order to live. And as they do that, they also release heat. Now we have this fox, the fox is not a vegetarian. It does not eat, it does not eat trees. It likes to eat things like squirrels and bunnies, but big picture, it's not producing its own food."
Science,"It's consuming food, so it also is a consumer. We can differentiate more in the future between things that eat plants, and things that eat other animals. And you can see in this food web, we draw an arrow from the thing that is being consumed to the thing that is doing the consuming. So a rabbit consumes a plant, and so the arrow goes from the plant to the rabbit. A fox consumes a rabbit or a squirrel, so an arrow goes from the rabbit or the squirrel to the fox."
Science,"Now some of you might have noticed that we have these arrows that are pointing downward. And so let me scroll down a little bit. And we see these microorganisms, the worms, the fungi, the mushrooms right over here, and we call these decomposers. Now what decomposers are really doing is what what you would imagine, breaking down all of the things that might die, the poop that is falling down. And by doing that, it's continuing to recycle that matter."
Science,"And when it decomposes, those atoms are released back into the soil, or the atmosphere, and then that can be reused by the producers. And once again, every organism in this food web is using some of the energy in order to exist, and do whatever it needs to do. And some of that energy is being released as heat in every single situation.."
Science,"So the first thing I'm going to ask you is, what are the producers in this food web. Pause this video and see if you can figure this out. All right, now let's work through this together. The producers are the ones that can take matter in the ecosystem, in the environment, and energy from an outside source, usually the sun, in order to construct themselves and also in order to store that energy. And when you look at a food web, producers are going to have arrows pointed away from them."
Science,So they're getting their energy and their matter from the environment and then other people are going to consume them. And we're gonna talk about them in a little bit. But we can see here that the kelp is a producer. This is an aquatic ecosystem that we're looking at. But the kelp is a producer. There's no arrows going into it so it's using the sun and elements and atoms and molecules that it's finding in its environment in order to grow. And we can also see that's the case with the phytoplankton.
Science,"It's also able to do photosynthesis, like the kelp, and capture that energy from the sun. Now, the next question I have is, where are the decomposers? Pause the video and try to answer that one. All right. Now you might remember decomposers, you can think about that's where a lot of the energy and the matter ends up, to be decomposed and then recycled again and be reused again by the producers."
Science,"And if you're looking at a food web, these would-be organisms where all of the arrows point to them, but you don't have any arrows coming from them. And over here, it's clear that the bacteria, and there's many different species of bacteria or many different types of bacteria, but the bacteria here are the decomposers. Next, I am going to ask you about the primary consumers. Pause this video and see if you can identify them. Well, primary consumers are consumers that directly eat the producers."
Science,"And so let's see, who is eating the kelp? You have have the sea urchin eating the kelp. You have the fish eating the kelp. Who's eating the phytoplankton? You have the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton. So these are primary consumers. Next, let's think about secondary consumers. Secondary. These are those that eat primary consumers. Pause the video and think about that. Well, let's think about who's eating these primary consumers. You have the otter."
Science,"What's interesting is the fish is a primary consumer because it consumes kelp, which is a producer, but it also can consume another primary consumer. So, a fish, or the fish here, are both primary and secondary consumers. And then I think we are done. So you can see the general notions here. The producers have arrows going away from them but no arrows coming into them because they're getting their energy from the sun and they're using the matter in the ecosystem."
Science,"Primary consumers are eating those producers, and you can see they have arrows going into them. And then they're eaten by other folks, secondary consumers, or those that eat the primary consumers. And then last but not least, you have the bacteria, which are decomposers, where the arrows all point to them and they continue to use that energy and then they take those nutrients, those molecules, and they put 'em back into the ecosystem so that it can be recycled again.."
Science,"But even this gives us some information about which organism are the producers, the primary consumers, the secondary consumers, and the decomposers. So the first thing I want you to think about is which arrows show us going from producers, I'll write it like, to primary consumers? Pause the video and think about that."
Science,"Which arrows show producers to primary consumers? All right, now in a food web, the giveaway that something is a producer is that it doesn't have arrows coming into it, it only has arrows coming out of it. And so organism one is a producer. Organism five is also a producer. Where are they getting their matter and energy from? Well, they're getting their matter from the environment and the energy, in most cases, is coming from the sun. And the things that eat the producers, those are primary consumers."
Science,"So this is an arrow that goes from a producer to a primary consumer. This is an arrow that goes from a producer to a primary consumer. And this is an arrow that goes from a producer to a primary consumer. Now, with that out of the way, which arrows show us going from a primary consumer to a secondary consumer? Pause the video and think about that. Well, I just said that these things that are consuming the producers, these are primary, I'll just say P for primary, primary consumer."
Science,"This is a primary consumer. This is a primary consumer, as well. Now secondary consumers are by definition things that aren't decomposers, but they're eating primary consumers. So they're going to have arrows coming in from primary consumers and out to either other secondary consumers or to decomposers. So organism three right over here is a secondary consumer. So we're going from a primary consumer to a secondary consumer. So this arrow is from a primary consumer to a secondary consumer."
Science,"This arrow over here is interesting. It's a secondary consumer being consumed, but you can see that organism four only has arrows going into it, which is a pretty good clue that this is a decomposer. So I'm not going to call organism four a secondary, a secondary consumer. So let's keep going. What about the arrow that goes from organism six to organism seven? That looks like primary consumer to primary consumer. Well, it turns out that something can be both a primary consumer and a secondary consumer."
Science,"So this is also a secondary consumer. Why, because it's eating a primary consumer and it's not a decomposer, so this is also another example of an arrow from a primary consumer to a secondary consumer. Last but not least, what are the arrows that go from a consumer, that go from a consumer, to a decomposer? And we already broke this down a little bit, no pun intended. Pause the video and try to think about that."
Science,"Well, this is the only decomposer that's depicted in this diagram, and so this is going from a consumer to a decomposer, right over here. This is from a consumer to a decomposer, and that's all we have here. And to be clear, you don't have to go only from a consumer to decomposer. You could have gone from a producer straight to a decomposer."
Science,"You could have arrows that look like that, as well, because if a plant dies and it gets decomposed, well, it's going to be, that matter and energy is going to be used by that decomposer.."
Science,"But what would this bird possibly eat in this kind of ecosystem? I'll give you a hint. It's in the bird's name. Turns out that Clark's nutcrackers love eating seeds, and not just any seeds, but mainly the seeds of pine trees, like this one, the whitebark pine. And it's actually good for the trees that nutcrackers eat those seeds. Wait. What? Let's take a look at the whitebark pine. These trees have cones, which hold their seeds."
Science,"Other pine-tree species have cones that will open when the temperature is warm enough or if the air is especially dry or when the cone is exposed to fire, but for the whitebark pine, their cones don't open on their own. Instead, the cones have to be pried open, and the Clark's nutcracker that does this as it looks for seeds to eat. But the nutcracker doesn't just eat the seeds. It stores them in what's called a cache, or a safe place, where they store the seeds to eat them later."
Science,"Remember, these birds live in an alpine ecosystem, where the spring and summer are pretty warm and there's lots to eat, but the winters are cold and long with very little to eat. So the nutcrackers have to stock up. In fact, the nutcrackers will cache up to 100,000 seeds in a single year. I can't remember where I put my phone half the time. But the nutcrackers don't retrieve all of these seeds."
Science,"Many of the caches won't be used by the nutcrackers, so those seed germinate and grow into new whitebark pines, and the cycle continues. Nutcrackers rely on whitebark pines as an important food source, and the whitebark pines rely on nutcrackers to plant their seeds. And on top of that, more than 100 other alpine species of plants and animals benefit from that relationship between the Clark's nutcracker and the whitebark pine."
Science,"For example, Douglas squirrels will also eat seeds from whitebark pine cones and mountain bluebirds and northern flickers may nest in the whitebark pine, too. When you look at it, all of these interactions that occur in this all pine ecosystem are like a web. Each population interacts with many other populations, and each population is affected by non-living parts of the environment like temperature and snowfall."
Science,"So a change in any one part of an ecosystem can lead to changes in many of the ecosystem's populations. For example, if something happens to the nutcrackers and their population starts to decline, that could cause some big problems for the pines that need these birds to plant their seeds. In turn, if the whitebark pine starts to decline, too, that can have negative impacts on all the other species that rely on this tree, like squirrels, bluebirds, and flickers."
Science,"Even though it seems like a perfect relationship between the nutcracker and the pine in the alpine ecosystem, every ecosystem is dynamic, meaning that parts of the ecosystem, both living and non-living, can and probably will change over time. Sometimes, ecosystems might experience a negative change, like a disruption. Maybe it's a particularly harsh and cold spring, and there aren't as many cones and seeds for the nutcrackers to cache."
Science,"Changes like that can make it harder for individual nutcrackers to survive and raise chicks, which can cause nutcracker populations to get smaller. But on the other hand, other types of changes can help individuals in a population. For example, if the ecosystem experienced a particularly warm spring after a wet winter, there would be lots of available food. These types of changes can cause more individuals to survive, have offspring, and increase their population."
Science,"Clark's nutcrackers and their relationship to the hard-to-open cones of the whitebark pine are just one example of the kind of relationships that drive many different ecosystems. Just like how a decrease in nutcracker populations could cause problems for the whitebark pine and other species in the ecosystem, a change to one species in any ecosystem can impact a whole web of interconnected organisms."
Science,"So next time you're outside and hear the call of a bird, think about all of the interactions that bird has with other parts of its ecosystem. These relationships are all part of the complicated web that is life on Earth. (bird caws)."
Science,"Islands are very beautiful and they also have a lot of biodiversity. Biodiversity can be described as the variety of species in an ecosystem. Now, some ecosystems have higher biodiversity than others, but all ecosystems have a variety of species that interact in specific ways with one another. Islands have such a variety of species that they're often called biodiversity hotspots. They're home to so many diverse species, much more so than the continents."
Science,"There are nearly half a million islands around the world, but they only make up about 5% of the Earth's land area. Yet, islands are home to 20% of the world's plant species and 15% of all mammal, bird and amphibian species. Many of these island species can only be found on one island or within a group of islands. For example, you can only find the 'i'iwi, a honeycreeper bird species, in the main Hawaiian islands in the North Pacific Ocean."
Science,"(birds chirping) The 'i'iwi are important pollinator species for Hawaiian plants, including the 'opelu and and the 'ohi'a. Pollination is an essential part of plant reproduction allowing plants to produce their fruits and seeds. While the 'i'iwi feeds on the sweet nectar of these plants, this bird also helps to support the next generation of 'opelu and 'ohi'a. These and other types of interactions are happening all the time between species in an ecosystem."
Science,"You can think of biodiversity as a sort of safety net, with each species as a knot, and the ropes between knots as their interactions. The diversity of species and their interactions, hold the net together allowing the ecosystem to function. Plus, the relationships between species are often unique. For example, the 'i'iwi has a special curved bill, and it's evolved to feed on the nectar of very specific flowers that are similarly curved. Like the 'opelu."
Science,"Now, even though the 'i'iwi is highly adapted to its environment, if something happens to the 'opelu or 'ohi'a and the plants start to decline, it can spell disaster for the 'i'iwi. When an ecosystem changes so much that a species can no longer survive? That species may become extinct or die out, causing biodiversity to decrease. And unfortunately, many of Hawaii's honeycreepers and overall biodiversity have been lost through extinction."
Science,"In the past, there were at least 20 other species of honeycreeper found across Hawaii, but many of them have become extinct over time. If we return to our analogy of biodiversity as a safety net? Whenever a species goes extinct it's like a knot becomes undone and parts of the net start to fall apart. A decrease in biodiversity is often a result of human activities which is especially clear in the Hawaiian Islands."
Science,"In the last few hundred years, agriculture, grazing, logging and development have taken almost half of Hawaii's forest cover. And along with it, a big part of its biodiversity. Humans have also brought non-native animals like rats and feral pigs to Hawaii, which have changed or destroyed native habitats. Plus, new diseases and climate change have led to the extinction of many Hawaiian species. When an ecosystem loses biodiversity, it doesn't function as well."
Science,"If 'ohi'a starts to disappear from Hawaiian forests? It's not just the 'i'iwi that loses an important food source, but the entire ecosystem is affected. In fact, scientists often look at how complete an ecosystem's biodiversity is in order to measure the ecosystem's health. The safety net of biodiversity is supported by having lots of different species, which allows the ecosystem to cope with natural disasters like drought, storms and disease."
Science,"With more biodiversity, ecosystems are stronger and more resilient so they can recover quickly. But, with less biodiversity, ecosystems become more vulnerable. I told you a lot about how Hawaii is losing biodiversity, however, there is cause for some hope. The nene, or Hawaiian goose, nearly went extinct. There were less than 30 birds in the wild 50 years ago. Now, thanks to lots of conservation work to improve the habitat for those species, there are over 3,000 nene throughout the islands."
Science,"We humans are part of earth's biodiversity too. We are components of the ecosystems we touch. So if we have the power to hurt these ecosystems, we have the power to protect and heal them too. Aloha.."
Science,"These toxins can cause serious health issues in humans. However, the vultures have evolved an incredibly acidic digestive system, allowing them to eat deceased carcasses without becoming sick. The lammergeier's stomach acid is so acidic that it can digest most bones in about 24 hours. Vultures are essential to keeping our ecosystems and us healthy by getting rid of harmful substances that could contaminate soil, water or food."
Science,"Carcass cleanup by vultures is something we call an ecosystem service, which is a way that we humans benefit from ecosystems. There are many different kinds of ecosystem services, which can be sorted into four categories. First, we have provisional ecosystem services, which are the resources that are provided by nature that we can use or eat, like fruits, vegetables\ and fish. Provisional ecosystem services also include clean drinking water, timber, oils, some medicines and natural energy sources."
Science,"We also have regulating ecosystem services, which are all the processes that help keep ecosystems healthy and functional."
Science,"These include bacteria and invertebrates decomposing or breaking down waste, bees and hummingbirds pollinating all kinds of plants and trees and other plants holding soil together with their root systems to help with flood control and to stop soil erosion, and, of course, regulating ecosystem services also include our friends, the vultures, who help with carcass removal and disease control. Ecosystems wouldn't work without supporting ecosystem services."
Science,"These are the underlying natural processes that are the foundation of ecosystems and without them, we wouldn't be able to breathe air, drink clean water or grow food. Take photosynthesis for example. When plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to make sugars and oxygen. Without photosynthesis, we wouldn't have enough oxygen in our atmosphere to breathe, and we wouldn't have all the foods that we get from plants, like fruits, seeds, and nuts."
Science,"Other supporting ecosystem services include the water cycle, the nutrient cycle and even soil formation and finally, we also have cultural ecosystem services. Have you ever visited or seen photos of the Grand Canyon, the Redwoods in California or Yellowstone National Park? These are incredible landscapes that provide a lot of meaning and inspiration to us. Think about the art and music that gets made about different ecosystems."
Science,"Maybe you've heard Dolly Parton's ""My Tennessee Mountain Home."" She couldn't have written that song about any other part of the country. You might have hobbies that you enjoy doing outside too. For me, I love bird-watching and learning about all of the different bird species that I can see where I live, and that's a cultural ecosystem service. Plus, ecosystems have religious, spiritual and historical value for diverse groups of people."
Science,"For example, American-Indian tribes have deep ancestral and spiritual connections to many North-American ecosystems. So ecosystems also play an important role in maintaining the richness and diversity of people's cultures and societies of our world, but a loss of biodiversity can make ecosystems less healthy, which makes it harder for us to get the resources and ecosystem services we rely on. Vultures might be able to eat all kinds of nasty toxins, but they can get sick and die from human-made chemicals."
Science,"For example, diclofenac, a common veterinary drug used to treat cattle, will unfortunately kill vultures if they eat it from a cow carcass. Vulture populations have declined by 95% in parts of the world, and that's caused some pretty big problems in ecosystems. With fewer vultures around to clean up carcasses, diseases can quickly spread, and bacteria from the carcasses can contaminate surrounding soil and water."
Science,"In turn, people can get very sick when vultures and others scavengers aren't around to keep the ecosystem healthy. So the next time you see a vulture gliding through the sky, take a moment to think about how that species is helping to keep the ecosystem clean and healthy for all. Through cleaning up carcasses and eating bones, vultures play an important role conserving the health of our ecosystems by transforming death and decay into life.."
Science,"We know this because these traits are typical of his breed, Labradors. But where do these traits come from? In this video, we're gonna find out. But first, let's start at the beginning. What exactly are traits? Traits are specific observable characteristics. They can be physical, like our puppy's eye color. They can be behavioral, such as a dog being more or less aggressive towards strangers. Or they can be health related, such as a dog's risk of developing a certain disease."
Science,"Traits are passed from parents to offspring. This is why our puppy looks so similar to his parents who were also Labradors. But, how does this occur? Well, traits are passed on from one generation to the next through the inheritance of genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that are passed from parents to offspring. Genes are found inside of an organism's cells as part of structures called chromosomes. In multicellular organisms, chromosomes are found inside the cell nucleus."
Science,"Chromosomes are often shown as X-shaped structures like this one. Each chromosome is a structure that contains one long molecule of DNA, which stands for ♪ Deoxyribonucleic acid ♪ All right, sing it with me. ♪ Deoxyribonucleic acid ♪ Or DNA, for short. Here's a model showing a small stretch of a DNA molecule. You can see that it's made up of lots of different atoms represented by these colored balls. The DNA molecule in a chromosome is like this, but much, much longer."
Science,"A chromosome's DNA molecule is coiled up in an organized way. This diagram shows what the DNA would look like if it were stretched out. This allows us to see where a chromosome's genes are located. Genes are specific stretches of a chromosome's DNA molecule. Each chromosome's DNA can contain hundreds or even thousands of genes. And in multicellular organisms, each cell contains multiple chromosomes."
Science,"It's the collection of genes and chromosomes that contain the information about all of an organism's inherited traits. Like our puppy here, his chromosomes contain thousands of genes to help him determine his coat color, eye color, and all the other traits he inherited from his parents. So our puppy must have one or more genes that caused him to have black fur. If he had been born with different versions of the fur colored genes, he may have had yellow or brown fur."
Science,"Heck, maybe one day someone will figure out how to change a puppy's DNA so that he has pink fur. And who knows? Maybe you'll be the geneticist to make it happen. That's it for today. Thanks for watching. And I hope to be seeing some pink puppies one day soon.."
Science,"Between a black mulberry plant, a Guinea pig, and a human being, which organism do you think has the most chromosomes? The mulberry plant has green leaves and delicious berries. The Guinea pigs are adorable, tiny mammals with multiple body systems and humans have incredibly powerful brains and the ability to form complex social relationships. Before I tell you the answer, let's learn a little more about chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures that contain an organism's genes."
Science,"And genes are the units of heredity passed from parent to offspring that affect an organism's traits. Chromosomes, and the genes they contain, are located inside an organism's cells. In multicellular organisms, the chromosomes are found within the cell's nucleus. Many species have chromosomes that come in matched pairs. For example, here's an image taken with a microscope of chromosomes from a typical human body cell."
Science,"The chromosomes are laid out in an organized way, allowing us to see that humans have 46 chromosomes, which can be organized into 23 pairs. Each of these is a pair of chromosomes. This is one chromosome, and this is the second chromosome. These paired chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes have the same size and shape. They also contain the same genes in the same locations. Remember, an organism's genes affect its traits."
Science,"Genes often come in different variations, called alleles. Different alleles of a gene can cause different versions of a trait. In an organism, a pair of homologous chromosomes may have the same allele for a gene, or they may have different alleles for a gene. To help us understand this, let's take a look at an illustrative example using pea plants. Pea plants can have pink or purple flowers. These colors are determined by two different variations, or alleles, of a single flower color gene."
Science,"Pea plants have a copy of this flower color gene on each of two chromosomes in a homologous pair. A single pea plant may have two copies of the pink allele, two copies of the purple allele, or one copy of each. The color of flowers that the pea plants end up with depends on how the alleles interact. But we'll cover that in another video. An image like this one, of an individual's chromosomes, lined up in an organized way, is called a karyotype."
Science,"Scientists and medical professionals can examine an individual's karyotype under the microscope to see if they might have a genetic condition. This could show up as size differences between chromosomes within each homologous pair or the presence of an extra chromosome. Now that you're a little more familiar with chromosomes, let's return to the question I asked at the beginning of this video."
Science,"Between black mulberry plants, Guinea pigs, and humans, which organism has the most chromosomes? Any guesses? The black Mulberry plants do! These plants have a whopping 308 chromosomes. Guinea pigs come in second with 64 chromosomes. And like we said earlier, us humans only have 46 chromosomes. So we come in third. Are you surprised? Believe it or not, humans, with their big brains and complex social structures actually have far fewer chromosomes than many seemingly less complex organisms."
Science,"Are black mulberry plants more complicated than we perceive? Perhaps. And perhaps there is more to understanding the role chromosomes play in determining traits. That's it for today, thanks for watching.."
Science,"But before we get into the details, let's start with the basics. What are traits? Well, traits are an organism's observable characteristics, and there are some really weird but really cool traits out there in the animal kingdom. Spiders, for example, can make seven different types of silk. Elephants have an amazingly low risk of developing cancer. And some jellyfish have the ability to glow. That's right! The crystal jelly can bioluminesce, or glow in the dark, all on its own."
Science,"So now let's dive into the details of how these traits are expressed. Specifically, let's look at the jellyfish trait of bioluminescence. We know that an organism's traits are affected by its genes. So let's travel into the nucleus of the crystal jelly's cells to where its genes are found, on chromosomes. A chromosome shown here is a cell structure that contains a coiled up DNA molecule. I personally like to think of chromosomes as the packaged and organized version of DNA."
Science,"A DNA molecule is made up of subunits, called nucleotides. Nucleotides are often called A, T, C, and G, which stand for adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. A gene is a specific stretch or a chunk of nucleotides within a DNA molecule. So a chromosome and its DNA are like a cookbook that contains recipes for making an organism. Genes are the recipes."
Science,"And just like how letters are arranged in a specific order to form words in a recipe, the nucleotides in a gene are also arranged in a specific order to convey information. So what does the cell make with these gene recipes? The cell uses the information in genes to make other molecules called proteins. So our crystal jelly must have genes on its chromosomes that are responsible for its trait of bioluminescence."
Science,"Because of work done by scientists, we now know that the jelly fish's bioluminescence involves one gene in particular. The coding sequence of this gene is made up of roughly 700 nucleotides, all arranged in a specific order. And this gene acts like a recipe for making a protein called green fluorescent protein, or GFP, for short. Whenever you hear the word fluorescent, just think glowy. GFP is a glowy protein that can emit green light."
Science,"And it's this presence of GFP in the jelly fish's cells that allows the jellyfish to bioluminesce. But proteins can do so much more than glow. There are thousands of tasks that different proteins carry out in order for cells to function. Some proteins help provide structure, some help move substances into and out of the cell, and others help carry out chemical reactions. All proteins are made up of subunits called amino acids which are connected in a chain."
Science,"It's the order of nucleotides in a gene that determines the order of amino acids in a protein. And the order of amino acids is important because it determines the 3D shape that the protein will take on. And a protein's shape, in turn, affects its function. For the GFP protein, this protein has a special sequence of three amino acids that end up in the middle of a barrel-like structure when the protein takes on its 3D shape. These amino acids form the part of the protein that can fluoresce."
Science,"They can absorb energy and then emit that energy as green light. So to sum it all up, genes affect traits through the actions of the proteins that they encode. The order of nucleotides in a gene determines the order of amino acids in a protein. And a protein's amino acids determines its structure and its function. The crystal jelly's bioluminescence and the discovery of GFP highlight why this knowledge is so important. Scientists have used the GFP gene and protein to make countless discoveries."
Science,"Now, researchers can attach GFP to other things, such as other proteins or viruses, making them visible through bioluminescence and easy to track. GFP has made the invisible visible, and it's allowed researchers to learn how neurons develop and how cancer cells spread. And all of this research started with wondering about a single trait observed in the crystal jelly. Similarly, scientists are studying the properties of spider silk proteins in order to make new biocompatible materials."
Science,And they're also studying elephants for clues about how to prevent cancer in humans. What animal trait do you think will lead to the next big discovery?.
Science,"But anyway, (chuckles) what we see right over here is what's often known as the central dogma of biology. It explains how we go from information in our DNA, which is really sequences of nucleotides, genes are segments of our DNA that code for specific things. So we see these nucleotides, which we denote with A, C, Gs, and Ts. And every three of them, that's known as a codon, and for every three of them, it's associated with an amino acid."
Science,"And in other future parts of your biology education, you'll go into more depth on the molecular structures of amino acids. But what you need to know now is the amino acids are essentially strung together. And then they create proteins. And proteins have all sorts of functions in your body. To a large degree, they make you, you. They construct what you are. So this is a simplified version of how we go from DNA, to you, to some degree."
Science,"Now, mutations, as you might know, even when you watch some movies, these are changes in DNA. You might have seen superheroes be exposed to radiation or some type of chemical, and then they get mutations, and then all of a sudden they have powers. Well, we don't know about too many mutations that create the ability to fly or to stick to walls. But mutations are a way that we get new genetic information in the gene pool. Now you might be saying, wait, I already know about sexual reproduction."
Science,"Sexual reproduction creates variation. And that's true. Sexual reproduction creates variation but it really just shuffles around the genes and the chromosomes they're on that exist already inside of a gene pool. Mutations are actually changes in the genes. Now, where do these mutations come from? Well, there are sometimes errors when DNA is copied, but can also happen from environmental influences, like radiation or other things."
Science,"Now, as you can imagine, many times, if you were to just all of a sudden eliminate some nucleotides, or if you were to change them into something else, that might be harmful. All of a sudden it might code for an amino acid here that does not allow this protein to function properly. Sometimes, it can be beneficial. And that's how we can get new versions of genes, alleles, or new genes altogether. All of a sudden this became that, this becomes a different amino acid, maybe this protein functions better."
Science,"And then as you can imagine, sometimes, it doesn't matter at all. Maybe the different amino acid here really doesn't change the structure of this protein. And in some cases, you can even change a nucleotide and it still codes for the same amino acid.."
Science,"All life comes from other life through the process of reproduction. Parents reproduce to form offspring, and during this process, they pass on their genetic information to their offspring. During sexual reproduction, two parents produce offspring. So each offspring gets a mixture of genetic information from two parents. Parents pass this genetic information to their offspring via chromosomes, the coiled up DNA molecules found inside your cells that contain genes."
Science,"Sexually reproducing organisms often have many different chromosomes, each containing specific genes. For example, this diagram represents a complete set of human chromosomes. As we can see, there are 23 different chromosomes assigned numbers one through 23. However, there are two copies of each chromosome, so that there are 23 chromosome pairs instead of 23 single chromosomes."
Science,"Each chromosome pair is a homologous pair, which means that the two chromosomes are the same size and contain the same genes in the same order. However, the alleles on the two homologous chromosomes may be different, meaning that the chromosomes may not exactly have the same genetic information."
Science,"Also, in case you're wondering, the last chromosome set is a little different, because that chromosome 23 is the human sex chromosome, which influences the biological sex of the individual, but we don't have to get into that just yet. What's important to know for our purposes is that sexually reproducing organisms with two sets of chromosomes in each of their cells are called diploid."
Science,"Diploid organisms, the D-I, di indicating two, have cells with two sets of chromosomes that are organized into homologous pairs. Sexual reproduction occurs through a process called fertilization, and during fertilization, cells called gametes, which are egg and sperm cells, fuse to form a new organism. Each parent contributes one gamete."
Science,"So you might be wondering, if each of the parents' organism cells are diploid, and offspring result from the fusion of cells from two parents, how do the offspring of sexual reproduction maintain the same number of chromosomes? Well, diploid organisms form gait that are haploid, meaning that they only contain one set of chromosomes. When you hear the word haploid, you can think of half, because haploid cells have half the amount of genetic information than diploid cells have."
Science,"A human haploid gamete, for example, contains 23 single chromosomes, one of each homologous pair. When gametes fuse during fertilization, that brings the total number of chromosomes back to 46, or 23 homologous pairs. So why is sexual reproduction so important? Well, not only does it allow organisms to produce offspring, but it also creates genetic variation and diversity."
Science,"The reason that offspring have different traits compared to their parents, and that one sibling looks different from another, can be attributed to sexual reproduction. This diagram here helps illustrate how sexual reproduction creates genetic variation. The diagram shows a cross between two hypothetical parents. It shows the chromosomes and the possible gametes that the parents can form, and the possible chromosome combinations in the offspring."
Science,"So in the diagram, we can see that each possible parent gamete contains one chromosome from a homologous pair, and during fertilization, gametes from each parent fuse together, resulting in offspring that have a combination of chromosomes from both parents, and this is where the genetic variability between parents and offspring comes from. Offspring are not genetically identical to either parent because they contain a mixture of genes from both."
Science,"The diagram also shows us that, because each parent passes on only one chromosome from each homologous pair, there are multiple combinations of chromosomes that can occur in the offspring. For example, the pink chromosome from parent one can be paired with the dark chromosome from parent two in one offspring, and the light blue chromosome from parent two in another offspring."
Science,"Keep in mind that this diagram only shows the inheritance of a single chromosome, but in humans, this occurs for all 23 of our chromosomes, and as a result, there are millions of different chromosome combinations that an offspring can inherit. This is why siblings can look alike, but aren't identical. Even more mind blowing, there are other genetic processes that occur during fertilization that increase variation even more, resulting in trillions of possible allele combinations for each offspring."
Science,"This is why no two people except monozygotic twins are genetically alike. To summarize, we learned that sexual reproduction occurs when two haploid gametes fuse together in fertilization, creating a diploid offspring with homologous chromosome pairs. We also learned that the patterns of chromosome inheritance during sexual reproduction lead to genetic variation in families and populations. It's why children look different from their biological parents, brothers, or sisters."
Science,"We've all inherited different sets of chromosomes because of sexual reproduction, which in turn makes each and every one of us one of a kind.."
Science,"So one came from one parent. The other came from the other parent. Chromosomes are nothing more than bunched up strands of DNA plus other things that help package it. So let's unravel a little bit to understand how these relate to genes. And then, we'll dive into a little bit more terminology around genetics. So you have this big, long strand of DNA and segments of this code for different genes. Maybe this part right over here is related to how tall you become."
Science,"So let's say that part right over there, that might be related to hair color. And in other videos, we talk about how these genes can essentially be translated eventually into proteins which are expressed in forms like height or hair color or eye color, or many, many, many, many other ways. But each of these chromosomes actually code, generally speaking, for the same genes. So if this one has a region that codes for that gene, this one will as well and this one will also."
Science,"The other chromosome in the pair will also have a region that codes for this other gene. Now, as you can imagine, the genes that get translated into the proteins that eventually are show up in your hair color, they can come in different versions. So what we call the different versions of a gene is an allele."
Science,"So for example, from this parent, you might have gotten the allele here that would describe, let's say, blonde hair, I'll denote that with lowercase b, while from this parent, you might have gotten the allele that's associated with say, brown hair. So they're both associated or they're both coding for the same type of protein that might play a role in hair color but they're different versions of it. So you could view an allele as versions or a version, I'll say, alleles are versions of a gene."
Science,"Now, if you know which versions you have, then you're able to say, ""I know my or I know the organism's genotype."" So in this situation, we know we have the capital B allele which is for the brown hair and we have the lowercase b allele which is for the blonde hair, and so the genotype in this situation, where you actually know what alleles you have, you would say that that is, you have a capital B from one parent and you have the lowercase b from another parent."
Science,"Now the thing you might be asking is, but what does this organism look like? How does this genotype actually get expressed? And if you're asking that question where you're asking a question of phenotype. Phenotype is what is expressed and this is usually observable in some way."
Science,"So the phenotype in this situation might be, and it's seldom this simple in genetics, but we're gonna make it simple in this scenario, that if you have a brown allele and blonde allele, that maybe the brown allele is dominant which is that if you have even one brown allele, at the end of the day, you're going to see brown. So I'll just write that down for this scenario although that's not actually going to be the case."
Science,"Genetics gets a lot more complicated than that but certain genes, certain alleles, they are that simply dominant or recessive. Now you can imagine there's many different genotypes based on what I just described that could result in this phenotype. You could have this genotype that we just showed. You could get a brown allele from both parents."
Science,"Either of these genotypes would express themselves as the phenotype brown, if we assume, and that is a big if, if we assume that this is the dominant version of the gene or the dominant allele. If that is, then in either case, it will express itself as the phenotype of brown. The only way you would get blonde hair in this scenario is if you had two of the recessive gene or the recessive version of the gene or the recessive allele. This would lead to a blonde phenotype right over here."
Science,"We've talked about dominant alleles. We've talked about recessive alleles and another piece of terminology that you will hear when you talk about genetics are notions of homozygous, homozygous and/or versus heterozygous genotypes. And when people are talking about homozygous or heterozygous, they're talking about the genotype. Homozygous, you might know the prefix homo refers to same."
Science,"So this is a situation where both the alleles are the same, same alleles, and heterozygous is a situation where hetero, that's referring to different, different alleles. So what would we call this scenario right over here? We would call this a heterozygous genotype for this gene. This would be homozygous dominant. We have two of the same dominant allele and this would be homozygous recessive. I'll leave you there. You're now armed to talk a lot about genetics.."
Science,"One allele or one version is for round seeds, which we're denoting capital R, and the other allele is for wrinkled seeds which we're denoting lowercase R. And they're telling us that the round seed allele, the capital R, is dominant. For a cross between two pea plants that are heterozygous for the seed shape gene, determine the expected ratio of offspring with round seeds to offspring with wrinkled seeds."
Science,"All right, like always, pause this video and see if you can have a go at this by yourself before we do this together. All right. Now let's think about the genotype for the two pea plants that are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have two different versions of the gene, or two different alleles. So these are going to be two pea plants that are capital R, lowercase R. They have one of each. And to see what happens in a cross between them, I will draw a Punnett square."
Science,"So just like this, and I will explain what I am doing in a second here. So I'll draw it like this. So what you need to think about is you have your two parents, and so each parent is capital R, lowercase R. Now that means that let's say parent one can contribute the capital R to the offspring or it could contribute the lowercase R allele to the offspring, and the same thing could happen for the other parent. It could contribute the capital R or it could contribute the lowercase R."
Science,"So what are all of the equally likely possibilities for the offspring? Well, the offspring might get a capital, the dominant allele, the round seed allele, from both parents, capital R, capital R. All I'm doing is I'm taking whatever letter's in the column and whatever's in the row. It could get a capital R from this parent and a lowercase R from that parent. It could get a lower case R from this parent and a capital R from that parent, or in this situation, it's getting a lowercase R from either one."
Science,"So these are the four equally likely genotypes. Now they're not asking us about genotypes. They're saying determine the expected ratio of offspring with round seeds to offspring with wrinkled seeds. So what does the genotype have to look like in order to have round seeds? Remember the round seed allele is dominant. Well, this would be a situation where you could be capital R capital R, but it's dominant. So you could also be capital R lowercase R and still have round seeds."
Science,"The only way that you're going to have wrinkled seeds right over here is if you are homozygous for the wrinkled seed allele. So this is the only wrinkled seed scenario. So if you look here, you look and see out of the four equally likely scenarios, three of them end up with a phenotype of round seeds and only one of them ends up with a phenotype. Remember, phenotype is what's being expressed. Only one of these four equally likely scenarios has a phenotype of wrinkled seeds."
Science,"So the expected ratio is going to be, you're gonna expect to see three offspring with round seeds for every one with wrinkled seeds or you would expect a three to one ratio. Now I have another part of this question that is asking us, what about a cross between a pea plant that is homozygous for wrinkled seeds and one that is heterozygous? Pause the video again and see if you can have a go at this one."
Science,"All right, so the first thing that I like to do is just think about, what are going to be the genotypes for each of these parents? So if we're talking about homozygous for wrinkled seeds, remember the wrinkled seed allele, we're denoting with a lowercase R. So that's going have a genotype of lowercase R, lowercase R, and then they say one that is heterozygous. Well, we already saw that before. That's going to be capital R and lowercase R. so let's draw a Punnett square again, to be able to do this."
Science,"So I'll do it like this, like that, like that and then make sure I have two columns and two rows, and let's put the homozygous parent up here. They could either contribute a lowercase R or they could contribute a lowercase R. They're gonna contribute one of these two, and then let's think about the heterozygous parent. Well, they can contribute a capital R, the dominant allele, or they can contribute a lowercase R. So let's think about the equally likely scenarios here, at least for genotype."
Science,"Well, these are all scenarios in which we get a capital R from this parent over here, the heterozygous parent, I guess I could say. So let me write capital R, capital R. And in both of these scenarios, we're getting the lowercase R from the homozygous parent. And both of these situations are we are getting the wrinkled seed allele from both parents. You're getting the lowercase R from the heterozygous parent, and in either scenario, you're getting a lowercase R from the homozygous parent."
Science,"So let me write that right over here. So, which of these genotypes would have a phenotype of round seeds? Well, round seeds are going to be scenarios where you have at least one of the round seed alleles. So these are all going to be round seeds, right over here. They're going to have a phenotype, I should say, of round seeds because remember, the round allele is dominant. Even though you have one of each, the dominant allele is what you're actually going to see in the phenotype here."
Science,"And then we see these two are going to be wrinkled, wrinkled. So what's the ratio of round to wrinkled going to be? Well, it's going be one to one. For every two round, you're going to have two wrinkled, or for every one round, you're going to have one wrinkled. Two to two is the same thing as one to one when we're talking about ratios, and we're done.."
Science,"Birds, like every modern species, have a series of ancestors stretching back through time. You can think of these as the species' grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents, and so on, going back thousands to millions of years. This series of ancestors is called a species evolutionary lineage. And, also like every modern species, birds have related species that share a part of their lineage but then branch off on their own evolutionary path."
Science,"The modern bird lineage stretches way back to 165 million years ago to the Jurassic Period. During this time, iconic dinosaurs, like the stegosaurus and brachiosaurus, roamed the Earth, as well as distant relatives of our modern-day birds, like archaeopteryx and anchiornis. Both archaeopteryx and anchiornis, among other bird-like dinosaurs, are considered some of the first birds based on their long arms, feathered bodies, wings and other physical characteristics that are shared by all birds."
Science,"But all birds, both modern-day species and these earlier bird relatives that lived in the distant past, all traced their evolutionary lineage back to a common ancestor, which is an ancestral group of organisms that is shared by one or more lineages. In other words, any of the modern birds that you see today, whether it's a dove or a penguin, they all evolved from the same bird-like dinosaur ancestor."
Science,"Evolutionary trees can be used to show the relationships between different lineages, like different bird species, and their common ancestors. Scientists build evolutionary trees using various lines of evidence, such as examining fossils and body structures or using DNA to identify shared traits and other similarities. The trees serve as models for studying evolutionary relationships over time."
Science,"So let's take a look at a tree that scientists built for city pigeons, also called rock doves, and their relatives. What can the tree tell us? How are doves and these other species related? Evolutionary trees are called trees for a reason. The evolutionary relationships between lineages are represented by branches showing who is related to whom and to what degree. The tips of the branches of an evolutionary tree show the modern groups of organisms. In this case, we have doves, mesites, and sandgrouse."
Science,"They all look different from one another, but you can see some physical traits, like their small bills, that are similar between all of these birds. Let's take a look at this evolutionary tree. What do you think that this branch point means? The branch point, or the place where branches split, represents common ancestors that existed in the past, among these bird lineages, from which these modern-day birds evolved."
Science,"Mesites and sandgrouse shared a common ancestor in the past, about 60 million years ago, which is represented by a branch point. But what does this branch point mean exactly? Basically, this branch point represents that at some time in the distant past, at least 60 million years ago, a bird species existed, that wasn't a mesite or sandgrouse, but it did have some traits found in both mesites and sandgrouse. This species was the common ancestor."
Science,"At some point, this common ancestor species split and gave rise to two different evolutionary paths or lineages. One of those paths gave rise to mesites and the other led to sandgrouse. And if we go even further back, to about 65 million years ago, we see yet another branch point representing another common ancestor. This common ancestor would later split to form two lineages, one giving rise to doves and the other leading to the common ancestor of mesites and sandgrouse."
Science,"Looking at this evolutionary tree, we can also learn about how closely related different lineages are. Organisms that share a common ancestor in the more recent past are more closely related to one another. But organisms that share a common ancestor in the more distant past are less closely related. The common ancestor of mesites and sandgrouse existed in the more recent past than the common ancestor of mesites, sandgrouse and doves."
Science,"This means that mesites and sandgrouse are more closely related to each other than they are to doves. Dinosaurs are far in the past now, but their relatives are still among us. All the birds that you see every day evolved from a two-legged feathered common ancestor that roamed the Earth over 165 million years ago with dinosaurs. So the next time you see a rock dove flying by or picking up scraps in a city square, you're really looking at a dinosaur, or at least a distant relative of a dinosaur.."
Science,"As I began curiously looking through them, I accidentally knocked a few over. Splitting some in the process. But to my surprise, one of the rocks that split in half had a secret hidden within it. Inside with the imprint of a tiny pine cone and nearby was rock covered in the imprints of leaves. I was so excited because that day I'd found real plant fossils, but what exactly are fossils and what can they tell us? Fossils are preserved evidence of organisms that lived in the distant past."
Science,"They can be made up of many different things like bones, shells, plants, or even markings like footprints that tell us about an organism's behaviors. These preserved remains are mostly made possible by specific kind of rock known as sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock is formed from compressed layers of sediment, which is a mixture of rocks, minerals, and organic matter. Sediment is the result of erosion, which is when bits of rock or soil break down and get deposited somewhere else."
Science,"Sediment is deposited in layers, one on top of the other. over millions of years, these layers become compressed, eventually solidifying and forming sedimentary rock. But how do the fossils even get inside of these rocks? Well, let's look back at the fossil I found. If I had to guess, a long time ago, some leaves and a pine cone must have fallen to the ground and gotten covered in sediment. As more sediment layered on top of them, the plants pressed an imprint of their shape and patterns into the sediment."
Science,"Over time, the sediment compressed into rock and the original plant decayed, but its imprint stayed inside the rock. Then finally, my fossil sat until I literally stumbled upon it. So now that we know what fossils are, what can they tell us? As I mentioned before, fossils are like little time machines that can show us what types of organisms where alive millions or even billions of years ago. And they can show us how life on Earth has changed over time."
Science,"But in order to unlock these secrets, scientists have to estimate the ages of the fossils they find. This can be done in two main ways. Either by looking at which layers of the sedimentary rock the fossils are found in or by using a process known as radiometric dating. Let's talk about layer analysis first. As you know, sedimentary rocks are formed in layers with each new layer forming on top of an old layer."
Science,"This means that the layers that are closer to the surface tend to be newer than the layers that are deeper in the ground. This means that a fossil found in a deeper layer of undisturbed sedimentary rock will be older than the ones found closer to the top. By looking through these layers, we're able to not only tell how old a particular fossil may be, but we can also look into the patterns of fossils over multiple layers to see how life on Earth has changed over time."
Science,"The second way scientists estimate a fossil's age is through a process known as radiometric dating. Radiometric dating tells us how old a fossil is by studying its chemical properties. Specifically, radiometric dating looks at the decay, or the loss of particles, from certain radioactive atoms in the fossils. Scientists know how fast this decay happens. So by measuring the amount of decay that has occurred, scientists can estimate the age of the fossil."
Science,"Once scientists know how old the fossil is, it can then be added to Earth's Fossil Record. Earth's Fossil Record consists of all the fossils found on Earth along with their relative ages. And it provides us with the big picture view of the history of life on Earth. And with that, you now know how fossils are formed and dated. Let's go back through the layers of this lesson and go over what we've learned today. Fossils are preserved evidence of organisms that lived long ago."
Science,"This evidence of life is most commonly found in layers of sedimentary rock. Now, depending on how deep they are in the layers of sedimentary rock or their results from radiometric dating, fossils can be given an estimated age and be placed on Earth's fossil record."
Science,"Now, when it comes to the fossil I found, it wasn't a major discovery like the discoveries of the Ichthyosaur, Plesiosaur fossils found by paleontologist Mary Anning, but it made me realize that discovering fossils is not carried out strictly by professional scientists. You and I can both find fossils too. All we need is a keen eye, some patience, and maybe a little bit of luck.."
Science,"Some, such as skeletons, document ancient organisms' anatomy or physical features, while others, such as preserved footprints, record organisms' behaviors. Each fossil that has been found is like a piece of a giant puzzle. To see the bigger picture of the history of life on Earth, scientists have to study the many fossils and see how they all fit together in the larger puzzle. All of the fossil puzzle pieces that have been discovered, along with their relative ages, make up Earth's fossil record."
Science,"The fossil record is basically a history of life on Earth as documented through fossils. By studying the fossil record, scientists can see how life on Earth has changed over evolutionary time. The fossil record allows us to see patterns of evolutionary changes that have happened throughout Earth's history."
Science,"These include an overall increase in organism complexity and diversity and the changes that have occurred along evolutionary lineages, showing us how one group of organisms could have evolved to the next. The fossil record also shows us when certain groups of organisms went extinct. First, let's take a look at the increase in organism complexity and diversity that is seen in fossil record. Over evolutionary time, organisms have generally become more complicated."
Science,"Some of the oldest known fossils are formations made by ancient colonies of cyanobacteria. These fossils provide evidence that single-celled organisms were living on Earth roughly around 3.5 billion years ago and that these organisms were relatively simple, similar to the bacteria we have today. The fossil record then goes on to document major leaps in complexity of life on Earth, with, for example, the large tube-shape cells of Grypania spiralis and the macroscopic organisms in the Francevillian biota."
Science,"According to scientists, these fossils, which are dated to be roughly from 2 billion years ago, could provide evidence of some of the earliest eukaryotic, or nucleus-containing cells, and of the earliest multicellular organisms. Not only does the fossil record show an increase in complexity over evolutionary time, but also an increase in the diversity of life on Earth."
Science,"For example, the Cambrian Explosion describes a multimillion year span of time, beginning about 539 million years ago, in which there was a huge increase in the diversity of animals on Earth. Almost all of the animal lineages we know today actually got started during this period. All of these increases in complexity and diversity have given rise to the millions of varied organisms that live on Earth today."
Science,"Next, let's take a look at the changes that can be seen along the evolutionary lineages in the Earth's fossil record. But before we do that, let's quickly look back at how scientists study fossils. As you may recall, fossils are found in sedimentary rocks, meaning that the deeper the fossil, the older the fossil is likely to be. So based on the layers in which the fossil is found, scientists can put them in order by age."
Science,"And in doing this, scientists can piece together the evolutionary steps of how one type of organism could have evolved into the next, eventually giving rise to the living organisms we see today."
Science,"To give an example of this, did you know that birds are actually direct descendants of a group of dinosaurs called theropods? It may be hard to believe, but the fossil record shows that an organism known as Archaeopteryx existed about 150 million years ago, towards the end of the Dinosaur Age, but before the appearance of modern birds."
Science,"This organism in particular is interesting, because it had some features unique to theropod dinosaurs, such as jaws and sharp teeth and some features unique to birds, such as feathers. So Archaeopteryx represents an evolutionary transition between theropod dinosaurs and birds in the fossil record. Finally, let's take a look at the patterns of extinction seen in the fossil record with the help of our extinct friend, the Triceratops. Extinction happens when a species completely dies out."
Science,"In the fossil record, extinctions show up as organisms of a certain species being present in older rock layers and then completely disappearing from the newer rock layers. For example, we only see Triceratops fossils in rock layers that are roughly 68 to 66 million years old. After this, we don't find any evidence of Triceratops fossils anywhere and there certainly aren't any Triceratops living today."
Science,"The Triceratops is an important example of extinction, as they not only went extinct, but they went extinct due to a mass extinction event. Mass extinction events happened when large-scale environmental change caused many groups of organisms to go extinct around the same time. When we see the triceratops disappear from the fossil record, we also see other types of organisms disappear, too, providing evidence for the mass extinction event that led to the disappearance of all non-avian dinosaurs."
Science,"And with that, you now know what Earth's fossil record is and the various patterns it can show us. Earth's fossil record is an essential tool that scientists use to piece together the history of life on Earth. And new fossils are continuously being discovered, so the fossil record is more than just a collection of fossils. It's a window into the mysteries of the past and it's ever-growing record of how life on Earth came to be what it is today.."
Science,"And over long periods of time, these genetic changes resulted in new species. And eventually, the vast diversity of modern organisms evolves. Some organisms share a more recent common ancestor than others do. Scientists have found evidence that we humans are more closely related to chimpanzees than we are to rabbits. And we're more closely related to rabbits than we are to sharks. And you might be wondering how can scientists determine how closely two species are related to each other."
Science,"Asking a shark, ""Hey, do you think we shared a common ancestor 440 million years ago?"" doesn't help, because even if they spoke English, they probably wouldn't know the answer either. Scientists analyze the similarities and differences between species to help figure out how they might be related in evolutionary history."
Science,"And they found significant evidence for evolution by using a variety of methods, including examining the fossil record, analyzing the DNA of different organisms and comparing the development of embryos, which are what organisms are called before they're born. However, you don't need a microscope or a fossil to find evidence for evolution. You can find it by looking at the anatomical or physical features of organisms alive today."
Science,"One way that scientists use information from the present day to make sense of past evolutionary relationships is by searching for clues called homologous features. When two species share a structurally similar anatomical feature that they inherited from a common ancestor, we say that the feature is homologous. The word homologous begins with a Latin prefix, meaning the same. And this makes sense, because when two species have homologous features, it means they share the same ancestor."
Science,"Have you ever looked at an x-ray of a human's arm? If you have, you might have noticed that we have humerus, ulna, radius, carpals and metacarpal bones. If you looked at the skeleton of a bird's wing, you could see that birds have a similar bone structure to ours. In fact, this similar bone structure appears in the forearms of many other animals, including dogs, cats, whales, elephants, and bats. These animals can use these features in different ways to fly, to run, to swim or to wave hello."
Science,"But despite these differences in function, the similarities of the bone structure indicate that these species inherited these features from a common ancestor. This means that the bone structure is a homologous feature. Compared to species with few similarities, two species that share many homologous features are likely to be more closely related, which means that they're likely to share a more recent common ancestor."
Science,"Species with fewer homologous features are likely to be less closely related, which means that they are likely to share a more distant common ancestor. For example, the wing of this bird has more structural similarities to the leg of this lizard than to the wing of this bat. This indicates that the bird is more closely related to the lizard than it is to the bat, which means that the bird and the lizard share a more recent common ancestor than the bird and the bat do."
Science,"When scientists believe they have found species with homologous features, they can use other methods to find out more about how the species evolved over time. They can compare the anatomical features of modern organisms to those found in fossils to see how much they have in common. Sometimes, scientists find features that seem to be homologous at first glance, but the features actually evolved independently along different species' lineages. These features are called analogous features."
Science,"For example, let's take a look at the wings of two flying creatures: a bird and a butterfly. In order to figure out whether the wings are homologous features, we need to examine the physical structure of the wings. The bird's wing is made up of hollow bones while the butterfly's wing is made up of membranes made out of a protein called chitin. So even though birds and butterflies can both fly, their wings have very different structures. This means that bird wings and butterfly wings are analogous features."
Science,"This indicates to scientists that birds and insects did not inherit that feature from a common ancestor. Instead, the ability to fly using wings evolved independently in each lineage. Comparing the anatomical features of organisms has given scientists a better understanding of how life on Earth has evolved from common ancestors. So next time you meet a friendly shark, perhaps the two of you can bond over your shared ancestry.."
Science,"An embryo is an organism that is in the earliest stages of development before it is born or hatched. Early on in the growth of a human embryo, the embryo has a tail-like structure. As time goes on, the embryo grows, and eventually the cells that made up that tail structure shift and form the tailbone, which makes up the bottom of the spine. By the time the embryo is eight weeks old, the tail is not visible at all. Humans are not the only species to have tails as embryos."
Science,"We share this trait with the embryos of many other vertebrates, which are animals with a backbone, such as monkeys, mice, turtles, and chickens. Scientists call features such as embryo tails homologous features. Structurally similar anatomical features that two species share that indicate that the species share a common ancestor. Identifying homologous features can help scientists figure out how different species are related to each other and how they evolved."
Science,"Studying embryos is a helpful way for scientists to find similarities between species. Similarities that might not be visible once the animals are born and grow up. In general, embryos of related species have more obvious homologous features at earlier stages of development, before the embryos anatomy becomes highly specialized. During the stages of an embryos development, the embryo goes through a lot of physical changes."
Science,"The embryo of an elephant starts out weighing less than a gram and it eventually grows to its birth weight of about 100 kilograms. Let's take a closer look at the kinds of changes the elephant embryo goes through as it develops. As an embryo grows, its physical structures change. Some structures become visible, and others disappear. For example, towards the beginning of development, an elephant embryo has structures called pharyngeal arches, or gill arches, on its neck."
Science,"As the embryo grows, the pharyngeal arches change structure and help form the ears and jaws of the elephant. And it turns out, all vertebrate embryos have pharyngeal arches early in their development. In fish, these arches develop into gill structures. In humans and other mammals, these arches develop into ear and jaw structures, just like they did in the elephant. Pharyngeal arches are homologous features, even though we can only see this homologous feature early on in embryo development."
Science,Pharyngeal arches provide evidence to scientists that all vertebrates share a common ancestor. More distantly related species tend to share fewer homologous features during both embryo development and after birth. More closely related species tend to share more homologous features during both embryo development and after birth.
Science,"So even though you don't have a tail, as far as I know, studying homologous features in embryos, shows scientists that humans are related to many tail-using creatures because of evolution.."
Science,"So natural selection is all based on at any given point in time, there is variation in a species. There are different traits that are expressed in different ways. And many times, a lot of those variations are fine, but then you can have environmental factors which make some of those traits more favorable than others."
Science,"And if those traits are more favorable to be able to survive, to be able to get food, or to be able to reproduce, well then the genes that code for those traits are more likely to be passed on generation after generation. And to make this very tangible, I will give you the example of the peppered moth, which is probably the most common example when people show evidence of natural selection. If you were to go to the mid 1800s in London, most of the peppered moths were the white peppered moths."
Science,"There were very few black peppered moths, but there was variation. There would be some lighter ones, there would be some darker ones, and in-between. Now what's interesting is between the mid 1800s and the late 1800s, you have the industrial revolution in London really hitting full gear. And so there was a lot of pollution in the air. And so a lot of the surfaces that the moths might rest on like trees, or the wall of a building, became darker and darker."
Science,"So as where these moths could rest became darker and darker, what do you think might have happened? Well, some of you might guess. In this different environment now, as the environment has gradually changed, all of a sudden having the traits that make you darker will be more favorable than they were even 30 or 40 or 50 years ago. And the white trait, which might've been okay in the mid 1800s, now all of a sudden makes these moths very obvious to see."
Science,"So if there was a bird that was looking for lunch, it'd be very easy to pick off the white moths versus the black moths. And what we saw is actually by the 1900s, most of the peppered moths in London were now darker in color. And so what you had happening generation after generation is variation in the moth color. But as the background environment became darker, the ones that were white colored were easier to pick off by predators."
Science,"And if they're picked off by a predator, they're definitely not reproducing and passing on their genes. And then the ones that were able to survive and pass on their genes were the darker moths. Now it's been interesting over the last 50 or so years as environmental regulations have gone into effect, and the air has started to clean up in places like London, you're seeing a return of the white peppered moth."
Science,"Because once again, the surfaces are no longer covered with soot, and so the variants that are lighter in color now have a decent chance of not being spotted. And if anything, now the darker ones might have a better chance of being spotted in this cleaner environment.."
Science,"And these beak depths, I would assume these are given in millimeters. Finches are quite small birds. And you can see in 1976, you have a large number of finches that had a beak depth of 8.8 millimeters, but it was a distribution around that. Now, after this data was collected, it turns out there was a drought and there were fewer seeds. So the smaller seeds, which were easy to eat for all of these finches, would have been consumed quickly."
Science,"And all that would have been left were the larger seeds, the ones that you need a larger beak in order to crack and get at the good stuff. So what do you think would have happened to the distribution of beak depths over the course of the next two years? Well, you might guess that the birds, the finches that have larger beak depths, are more likely to survive because they're more likely to be able to crack the larger seeds."
Science,"And the finches that are more likely to survive are also more likely to reproduce, and pass their large beak trait to their offspring. And that is indeed what scientists observed. As we go from 1976 to 1978, the distribution has shifted a pretty good bit to the right. Now the most common beak depth is 9.8. So this is an example of an environmental change, a drought, changing the food supply, because now there's fewer small seeds available, that changed a distribution in beak depths over just two years."
Science,"Now, environmental changes don't always cause adaptation. If it's too severe, if the drought was so strong that there were no seeds, you could have extinction. So the species disappears altogether. But here we have an example that in just two years, a species was actually able to adapt a pretty good bit. Now, no individual member of the species knew to somehow grew their beak. But as we saw, you always have a variation of beak depths."
Science,"And year after year, the birds with the bigger beak depth, were more likely to survive and reproduce. So the species as a whole adapted to the new environmental conditions.."
Science,"Although in, for example, the case of this character and this character, the mechanics could get quite difficult. But an interesting question is, is where do dogs come from and why do we have these seemingly specialized breeds amongst dogs? You might have things like a Rottweiler that's better for protection, you might have things like terriers that have been specialized to maybe go after rodents. You have things like border collies that are good at herding other types of animals."
Science,"The simple answer is, through artificial selection and domestication. Remember, in any population of a species there's variation in that species. And when we talked about natural selection, that's where the environment might select for certain of those variants. Certain of those variants might make it a little bit easier to survive or reproduce, and then those would predominate and that's how evolution happens. Artificial selection and domestication is where humans take matters into their own hands."
Science,"And instead of waiting for nature to do things, they are the selection factor. They pick which of the species get to reproduce and which ones don't. And when you have that type of artificial selection, the change can happen much, much faster. Breeding is essentially artificial selection. So dogs like this, and all the dogs we know of had ancestors that looked like this, that looked like a wolf, that were a wolf."
Science,"And what we theorize is that the early stages of some wolf eventually evolving into dogs might have been more traditional natural selection where tens of thousands of years ago our hunter gatherer ancestors as they hunted and gathering they might have left over food here or there, and some of the wolves that just happened to be the variants that were a little bit more comfortable getting close to humans might have benefited from being able to get some of that left over food, being able to get some of the remains that the human beings left behind."
Science,"But then over time, human beings probably realized that hey, these wolves are useful to have around. Maybe they provide some form of protection, maybe over time they started breeding the wolves so the wolves that were especially friendly, the wolves that were especially good at a certain task, say protection, or going after some type of an animal or retrieving things, they allowed those to reproduce together and over time, over tens of thousands of years, we went from wolves to dogs."
Science,"And even once we had dogs, the breeding got even more specialized. As I mentioned, things like border collies, this was many years, many generations of breeding where sheep herders might have selected dogs that were good at herding sheep. That terriers came from dogs that were good at going after rodents, things like rottweilers or dogs breeding the dogs that were especially good at providing protection or defense. And it isn't just dogs that are products of artificial selection and domestication."
Science,"Pretty much any animal that you might see on say a farm would be the product of artificial selection and domestication. A wild pig looks like this, while the ones that you would see on a farm look like that. And once again, they would have selected for things like docility, things where they're less aggressive and they're easier to take care of. And artificial selection and domestication does not apply just to animals."
Science,Pretty much anything you might see in the produce section of your supermarket is the product of artificial selection and domestication.
Science,"There might be wild variants of these different vegetables or these different fruits, but over roughly 10 or 15,000 years of human agriculture, every generation of crop they would have selected for the crops that are more robust, that tasted better, that were able to grow in different climates and by allowing those variants to reproduce, we eventually ended up with the domesticated crops we see today.."
