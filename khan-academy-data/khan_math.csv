Math,"Notice we went from ones to tens, tens are ten times as much as ones. And then we move one space to the left of that, we go to the we multiply by tens again. We get to the hundreds space and so this nine doesn't just represent nine, it represents nine hundred or we could write that as 900. Similarly the seven doesn't just represent seven, it represents seven tens or 70. This three represents three ones, so it actually does represent three."
Math,But as I promised we're now going to extend our understanding and what we do is we put a decimal here which you've probably seen before at the right and the reason why we even need a decimal is to really tell us where our ones place is. We say okay if we go right to the left of the decimal that's going to be our one space because once we start introducing decimals we can introduce as many spaces as we want to the right of the decimal. And so let's think about those a little bit.
Math,"If when we went from hundreds to tens, notice we divided by ten, when we go from tens to ones, notice you divide by ten. So what do you think this place over here is going to be called? Well what happens if you take one divided by ten? Well then you get a tenth so as you might imagine this is the tenths place. And then if you were to go one place to the right of that, what would this place be? Well it'd be tenths divided by ten or 1/10 of a tenth, so this would be a hundredth, hundredths place."
Math,"And then if you were to go one space to the right we could keep doing this forever, but if we were to go one space to the right of that, what would it be? Well a hundredth divided by ten or 1/10 of a hundredth is a thousandth, thousandth space."
Math,"And so for example if I were to extend this number instead of if just being 973, if I were to write 973.526, what do these numbers these digits represent? This five doesn't just represent five, it represents five tenths or another way of writing five tenths you could write it like this 0.5 you just have a five in the tenths place. Or you could write it as five tenths."
Math,"This two I think you get where this is going, this doesn't just represent two, it represents two hundredths I'm just going to make it very explicit in this video, so it's very clear two hundredths. Another way to write that is you just write a two in the hundredths place. So we're going one two spaces to the right of the decimal or you could write it as two over 100, two hundredths."
Math,"And so for kicks, pause the video what are all the different ways of representing this six? What does this six represent? Well this is six thousandths, six thousandths, thousandths, there you go. I could also write that as zero point, let's see it's the tenths place, hundredths place, and then in the thousandths place I have six or I could write this as six over 1000, six thousandths."
Math,So big picture place value we can keep going to the right of the decimal and we can start representing things that are I guess you could say more precise..
Math,"So our point is between three hundredths and four hundredths and the space between three hundredths and four hundredths is divided into ten equal spaces. So if this whole thing is a hundredth, so this whole thing is equal to 0.01 the difference between that, that's a hundredth so then each tenth of that is going to be a thousandth."
Math,"So let me, I don't want to make this too messy so this right over here will be one tenth of a hundredth which is going to be a thousandth, so it's going to be 0.001 we have a one in the thousandths place. So one way to think about it, this number is going to be 0.03 so we have our three hundredths but then let's see how many thousandths we have to add to it to get to this value right over here."
Math,"We have to add one thousandth, two thousandths, three thousandths, four thousandths, five thousandths, six thousandths, seven thousandths, and eight thousandths. So we're starting at three hundredths and then we are adding eight thousandths so you add 0.008 to get to this value. So if you were to add these two together you're going to have three hundredths and then the next place over is the thousandths place and we have eight of them."
Math,"So this point right over here is 0.038 or you could do this as 38 thousandths because three hundredths is 30 thousandths, so any way you want to view it, this is the value of the point graphed on the number line 0.038.."
Math,"The 9 right over here, this is in the hundreds place. This literally represents nine hundreds. So we could rewrite that 9 as nine hundreds. Let me write it two ways. We could write it as 900, which is the same thing as 9 times 100. Now, there's a 0. That's just going to represent zero tens. But zero tens is still just 0. So we don't have to really worry about that. It's not adding any value to our expression or to our number. Now we have this 5. This 5 is in the ones place."
Math,"It literally represents five ones, or you could just say it represents 5. Now, if we wanted to write it as five ones, we could say well, that's going to be 5 times 1. So far, we've represented 905, 900 plus 5 or 9 times 100 plus 5 times 1. And you might say hey, how do I know whether I should multiply or add first? Should I do this addition before I do this multiplication? And I'll always remind you, order of operations. In this scenario, you would do your multiplication before you do your addition."
Math,"So you would multiply your 5 times 1 and your 9 times 100 before adding these two things together. But let's move on. You have another 0. This 0 is in the tenths place. This is telling us the number of tenths we're going to have. This is zero tenths, so it's really not adding much, or it's not adding anything. Now we go to the hundredths place. So this literally represents seven hundredths. So we could write this as 7/100, or 7 times 1/100. And then finally, we go to the thousandths place."
Math,"So we go to the thousandths place. And we have four thousandths. So that literally represents 4 over 1,000, or 4 times 1/1000. Notice this is coming from the hundreds place. You have zero tens, but I'll write the tens place there just so you see it. So it's zero tens, so I didn't even bother to write that down. Then you have your ones place. You have five ones. Then you have zero tenths. So I didn't write that down. Then you have seven hundredths and then you have four thousandths. And we are done."
Math,"We've written this out, really just understanding what this number represents.."
Math,"Well, the stuff to the left of the decimal point is pretty straightforward. Let me actually color code it. So we have 6, 3. Let me do it all in different colors. And then we have a decimal, and then we have a 1 and a 5. There's one common way of doing this, but we'll talk about the different ways you could express this as a word. But we know how to write this stuff to the left. This is pretty straightforward. This is just sixty-three. Let me write that down. So this is sixty-three."
Math,"And instead of the decimal, we'll write, and. Now there's two ways to go here. We could say, and one tenth and five hundredths, or we could just say, look, this is fifteen hundredths. One tenth is ten hundredths. So one tenth and five hundredths is fifteen hundredths. So maybe I can write it like this: sixty-three and fifteen hundredths. Just like that."
Math,"Now, it might have been a little bit more natural to say, how come I don't say one tenth and then five hundredths? And you could, but that would just make it a little bit harder for someone's brain to process it when you say it. So it could have been sixty-three-- so let me copy and paste that. It could be sixty-three and, and then you would write, one tenth for this digit right there, and five hundredths. Sixty-three and one tenth and five hundredths is hard for most people's brains to process."
Math,"But if you say, fifteen hundredths, people get what you're saying. Not to beat a dead horse, but this right here, this is 1/10 right here and then this is 5/100, 5 over 100. But if you were to add these two, If you were to add 1/10 plus 5/100 -- so let's do that. If you were to add 1/10 plus 5/100, how would you do it? You need a common denominator. 100 is divisible by both 10 and 100, so multiply both the numerator and denominator of this character by 10. You get 10 on the top and 100 on the bottom."
Math,"1/10 is the same thing as 10 over 100. 10/100 plus 5/100 is equal to 15 over 100, so this piece right here is equal to 15/100. And that's why we say sixty-three and fifteen hundredths.."
Math,"Before I even look at these choices, I'm just going to really understand what this number represents and let me just rewrite it. So we have 8.76 so there's a couple of ways we could think about it, we can look at our place values, this right over here this is the ones place, this right over here this is the tenths place, and this right over here is the hundredths, hundredths place."
Math,"And so we could view this as eight ones and seven tenths and six hundredths or eight ones plus seven tenths plus six hundredths. Well that's exactly what they wrote right over here. Eight ones, seven tenths, and six hundredths, so I would choose that one for sure. Now this second choice looks like an expanded form, but before I even look at it let's see how we would think about it over here."
Math,"If we wanted to essentially write the same idea but in expanded form, eight ones is the same thing as eight times one and actually let me color code it so you see where things are coming from. So eight ones that's the same thing as eight times one and to that we would add seven tenths, so that's plus seven times 1/10 so seven tenths plus and I'll do this in this orange color, six hundredths so that's plus six times a hundredth, six hundredths."
Math,"So this would be this number in expanded form is that what they put right over here, yes it is indeed what they put right over here, so I will circle that in. Now if you're doing this on your own we know that we just picked two answers, but let's see whether these other forms or let's see if we can write this in these other forms and see how these might not be the exact answer."
Math,"So if we were to write this out and take out each of the decimal parts, so the eight ones you'd just write that as eight, the seven tenths, seven tenths well that would be plus 0.7 this is seven tenths right over here, this and this and this part right over here are all equivalent and then last but not least you have your six hundredths, so plus so that's our ones, that's our tenths, and then we're in our hundredths place and we're going to have six of them."
Math,"So this would be equal to our original value but that's not what they wrote over here, they did write eight ones, they did write seven tenths, but they did not write six hundredths, they wrote six thousandths here. So we could rule that one out."
Math,"And then if we were to write it out in words we would say this is eight eight and do and in a neutral color, now you might say and seven tenths and six hundredths, or you could often what's normally is you express it in the lowest place that you have or the most precise place that you have so you could do seven tenths as 70 hundredths or you could view, you could view this whole thing as 76 hundredths so it could be eight and 70, 70 six hundredths, hundredths."
Math,"But what they wrote over here they did write eight but instead of 76 hundredths, they wrote eight and 67 hundredths a little tricky so we would rule that one out as well.."
Math,"It's a 10 by 10 grid, and we can see that one, two, three, four, five, six, seven of them are shaded in. So this represents 7/100, so this is 3.47, or three and 4/10 and 7/100 or three and 47/100. Now what we're going to do is explore how are other ways you can put the value into the different places? So let me set up a little table here."
Math,"I don't think I'm gonna need all of that space, but we have, in this first example, so we have our ones, we have our ones place, we have our tenths place, and we have our hundredths, hundredths, hundredths place. I have to curve up a little bit. And so what we just did is we said, hey, this was pretty straightforward."
Math,"This was three ones, three ones, 4/10, and 7/100, 7/100, but are there other ways that we could look at it? For example, is there a way of re-imagining this, so instead of three ones, we have two ones, and we still have 7/100, so how many tenths would we have in order for it to be the same value? Pause this video and think about that. All right, we'll do it together and to help us, I will put what we had here just now."
Math,"Now what's different instead of having three ones, we now have two ones, so we could say that these are two ones right over here, our two ones. We have our 7/100 right over here. So essentially, we would have to express all of this in terms of tenths. So how would we express it all in terms of tenths? Well, this, what used to be a one, this is equivalent to 10/10. Let me make that very clear. I could, let me see if I could shade this in with that green color, so there you go."
Math,"I'm gonna shade with the green color and then I'm gonna draw a bunch of lines here to make it very clear, so I'm just gonna hand draw it so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and 10. Did I do that right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. And I didn't draw it as straight I need to. They really should be 10 equal sections, but it's hand drawn, so I think you understand. So notice. I took the exact same value, but I have regrouped."
Math,"I have regrouped this one right over here into tenths. So how many tenths are here? Well, now I have 10 plus 4/10. So now I have shaded in 14/10. That was interesting. Let's do another example. So now let's imagine another scenario. Let's imagine a scenario where we have three ones again, but this time, instead of having 7/100, we have 27/100. So in that circumstance, how many tenths would we have? Pause this video and see if you can work it through. All right, well let's get that same number again."
Math,"And now let's think about how we might have to regroup between the places. So we have our three ones, so that was just like the first case right over there, so we have our three ones. But now we have 27/100. So in addition to these 7/100, we have to find another 20/100 someplace. Well, the most natural place to go would be right over here and 20/100 is the same thing as 2/10. So what we want to do is we would convert these two tenths into hundredths, so let me actually just shade it in a little bit."
Math,"So I'm going to convert this right over here to hundredths. And so did I do that right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. And so there you have it. This plus this gives us our 27/100, and so how many tenths do we have left? We have 2/10, 2/10. So in this situation, we regrouped two from the tenths place and we expressed them as hundredths. So 2/10 became 20/100, added to the 7/100 that you already have and we now have 27/100. Hopefully that makes sense.."
Math,"So you really need to fill out what would you put in here for this to be a representation of 10.74? All right, now let's do it together and I'm gonna rewrite the number a little bit larger so we can really inspect the place values. So one way to think about it is we have zero ones and then we have one 10. But they don't express it that way. They don't say one 10 and zero ones up here. They just say 10 ones, but that's reasonable."
Math,"So when they're saying 10 ones here, they are referring to those 10 ones, or you could view that as one 10 and zero ones. Either way, you have 10 ones, and then if you move one decimal place over, this 7/10, well that makes sense. You have a seven in the tenths place and then this 4/100 makes sense. You have four in the hundredths place. But now let's see what they're doing over here. So once again, they're saying no 10s, but 10 ones. So that is actually the same."
Math,"We could say one 10 and zero ones, or we could say 10 ones. And now over here, they've reduced the number of tenths. You know, you're like, hey, what's going on? I have, there looks like there's 7/10 here. But one way to think about it is they're regrouping from one place to another. And so what they've done is they've taken that extra 10th and they've put it someplace. And the only other place they could put it is in the hundredths place."
Math,"So if I were to take a tenth from the tenths place, a tenth is worth 10 hundredths. So one way to think about it is, you're taking a tenth from there, so now this is going to be, this is going to be 6/10, and if you, where you're going to put that tenth, well you could put it in the hundredths place, but a tenth is going to be 10/100. So if you add 10/100 to the 4/100 that are already there, well, that is going to give you 14/100, so we would put a 14 right over there."
Math,"Let's do another example just to really make sure we're understanding what's going on. So once again, they say fill in the table with whole numbers to make 5.4 in three different ways. So pause this video and see if you can have a go at it. All right. So I'm gonna write the number, so we have 5.4, and in this first row, this is maybe the most standard way or traditional way of interpreting 5.4."
Math,"In our ones place, you have a five and you see that, five ones, and in our tenths place, we have a four, and that's what they have right over here, 4/10. But what are they doing in this second row? Well, they're saying 24/10. 24/10, so somehow, in way to think about it, in the tenths place, they were able to add 20/10. So they went from 4/10 to 24/10. So if you're adding 20/10 here, they must have taken it away from some other place."
Math,"20/10 is the same thing as two ones, so they must have taken two ones away from here. So they took two ones away from here, so this would be three ones and now 24/10. So we could put a three right over there. And you can verify that. 24/10 is the same thing as two wholes and, or two ones and 4/10 or 2.4. 2.4 plus three is going to be equal to 5.4. All right. So here, we only have one one, and so what happened to the other four ones? Well, they must have been transferred to the tenths place."
Math,"So let me rewrite the number. So if we were to take four ones away from the ones place, so we're taking four away from this, we only have one left, and what would happen if I transferred those four ones to the tenths place? Well, then there would be 40/10. Four ones are 40/10, so we would add 40 to 40/10 over here, so we already have 4/10, so this would become 44/10. 44/10. And we're done.."
Math,"This 2 is in the tens place, so it literally represents 2 tens. So this is equal to 20, 2 times 10. This 1 is literally equal to 1. It's 1 one. And then this 3 is 3/10, so plus 3/10. But now I want to rearrange or regroup the value in these places. So, for example, I could take 1 from the ones place and give it to the tenths place. So let's see how that would work. So we're going to take 1 away from the ones place, and so it's going to become a 0. And we're going to give it to the tenths place."
Math,"And what we're going to see is that that's going to make the tenths place into 13/10. Now, does that actually make sense that I took 1 from here and it essentially added 10 to the tenths place? Well, let's rewrite what this represents. So we still have 2 tens. So this is still going to be 2 tens. Now we have plus 0 ones. And we essentially wanted to write that 1 that we took away from the ones place in terms of tenths."
Math,"So if we were to write this in terms of tenths, it would be 10/10 plus the 3/10 that were already there. And so this is going to be equal to 13/10. Let me write that down. So this is equal to 20. That's the color you can't see. This is equal to 20 plus 0 ones, so 2 tens plus 0 ones plus 13 tens. Let's do another example with this exact same number. So once again, 21.3. And I'll write it out again. This is equal to 20 plus 1. We'll do that in the purple color. Plus 1 plus 3/10, plus 3 over 10."
Math,"Now, I could take 1 from the tens place so that this becomes just 1. Now what do I do with that 10? Well, let's say with that 10 I give 9 of it to the ones place. So I give 9 of it to the ones place so that this becomes 10. And I still have 1 left over, and I give it to the tenths place, so that's going to become 13/10. So what did I just do? Well, I could rewrite this. Let me be clear what I did. This is the same thing as 1 plus 9. Actually, let me write it this way. 1 plus 9 plus 1."
Math,"That's obviously the same thing-- 10 plus 9 plus 1 is the same thing as 20. And of course, we have what we have in our ones place, plus 1 plus 3/10. And what I want to do is I want to take this 9, the 9 that I took from the tens place and give to the ones place. And I'm going to take this 1 that I took from the tens place and give it to the tenths place. So 1 is the same thing as 10/10."
Math,"And so when you regroup this value, you get this as being equal to 10 plus-- 9 plus 1 is 10, and then 10/10 plus 3/10 is 13/10. So that's all that happened here. I changed the value in the places. I took 1 ten away. I had 2 tens. Now I'm only left with 1 ten. And that extra 10 of value, I regrouped it. I gave 9 to the ones place. So 1 plus 9 is 10. And then I gave 1 to the tenths place. So 1 plus 3/10 is the same thing as 13/10.."
Math,"So to figure out which one of these is greater, I like to start with the largest place values and then keep moving to smaller and smaller ones until we actually see a difference. So they both have nine 1's. So at least in the ones place, they seem comparable to each other. Now let's go to the tenths place. So this number on the left has a 9 in the tenths place, while the number on the right has a 7 in the tenths place. So right now, we could view this-- let's just write the whole numbers out."
Math,"So this one is 9 plus 9/10. We haven't gone to the hundredths place yet. So far, out of the two digits, the two places we've looked at, this one on the right is 9 plus 7/10. So this immediately cues to me that the one on the left is the larger number. You're like, hey, how do I know immediately that's the larger number? I have all this other stuff to the right. I have this 98 to the right. I have this 7 to the right."
Math,"And the way to think about it is, no matter what you have, even if you really increase this right-hand side here as much as possible, you're still less than 9.8. In fact, if you keep incrementing the thousandths here, you go from 9.798 to 9.799 to 9.8. So you would have to actually increase to get to even 9.8. And this is at 9.9. So you can really just look at the discrepancy in the largest place value to recognize which number is greater. This has 9/10. This has 7/10."
Math,"It doesn't matter what's going on in the hundredths and the thousandths place. And to make that clear, let's actually add up these numbers and compare them as fractions. So let's keep on going with this. So you have 7/100 here. And here you have 9/100. And then finally, here you have 0/1000. And here-- let me do that in a different color. I already used blue. And here, you have 8/1000. So plus 8/1000."
Math,"So let's put everything in terms of thousandths so that we can add these all up and have two fractions over thousandths, or things in terms of thousandths. So 9 is the same thing as 9000/1000. 9/10-- well, let's see. If you multiplied it by 10, you would get 90 over 100. Multiply by 10 again, you get 900/1000. 7/100 multiplied by 10 is 70/1000. And let's do that over here. Once again, 9 is 9000/1000, and then plus 700/1000 plus 90/1000-- just multiply the numerator and denominator by 10-- plus 8/1000."
Math,"And so what is this number on the left? This number on the left is-- how many thousandths is it? It's 9,970. So it's 9970/1000, while this number on the right here is 9798/1000. So here, once again, you're comparing two numbers. They have the same number of thousandths. This has 900. This only has 700. So even though this is almost 800, 800 is still less than 900. So no matter how you think about it, the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.."
Math,"So I assume that they're asking us which of these is greater. And so let's rewrite these numbers. 156.378, and we want to compare that to 156.348. And it might already be obvious to you which of these is greater. But I'll work through it step-by-step, just in case it's not. So let's first go to the hundreds place."
Math,"And you could view this as, to some degree, the most significant place, because this is where they have the largest-- the 1 in the hundreds place represents a lot more than a 1 in the tens place or a 1 in the six's place. A 1 in the hundreds place represents 100. It's this many hundreds. But we have the same number of hundreds in both situations. We have 1 hundred and we have 1 hundred. Let's go to the tens place. We have 5 tens here, which is 50. And we have 50 right over here."
Math,"So, so far they're equal, so far, if you just look at the hundreds and the tens place. Let's go the ones place. We have a 6 here in the ones place, 6 ones, which is really just 6. And you also have 6 ones. So, so far, they're equal again. Let's go to the tenths place-- 3 tenths, 3 tenths. Let's go to the hundredths place. So we're going into smaller and smaller places. So then you have the 7 hundredths. And now we have 4 hundredths here. So this has less hundredths than this does over here."
Math,"And if we go to the thousandths place, these are equal. But it doesn't matter, even if these were unequal. It doesn't matter, even if this one was larger than this one, because in the more significant place, this number was larger than this number. So 7 is greater than 4. We have 7 hundredths here. We have 4 hundredths here. So we get this number is greater than this number down here. Or 156.378 is greater than 156.348. And in particular, it's because of the hundredths place.."
Math,"What I would like you to do is order these numbers from least to greatest. Take out some paper and try to do it on your own before we do it together. All right, now let's do it together. And the way I would tackle ordering numbers is I would go to the largest place value that the numbers have in common. And so, in this situation, we have a ones place value in all of them. And so we can see that this has one one, this has zero ones, and this one has one one."
Math,"So the thing that has the least ones is going to be the smallest of the numbers. So this one over here is going to be the smallest of the numbers. So let me just write that over here. 0.113. And now we have to figure out which one is next between 1.001 and 1.101. Well then we just go to the next place value. So we go to the tenths place and we right over here, they're equal on the ones place. So if you go to the tenths place, this one has zero tenths while this one has one tenth."
Math,"So the number on the right here is going to be larger. It has more tenths. Same number of ones, but it has more tenths. It doesn't really matter what happens to the right of that. So the next smallest number, if we're ordering from least to greatest, is going to be 1.001. And then last, but not least, would be this one. That is the largest, 1.101. Let's do another example. Let's say we had the numbers 0.424, 0.343, and 0.443. Pause this video and try to order these from least to greatest on your own."
Math,"And once again, the idea here is always start with the largest place value and then compare, and then keep moving to the right if some things are equal. All right, now let's do this together. So they all have zero ones, so they're all equal there, so that's not gonna tell us much. So now let's go to the tenths place. So here I have four tenths. Here I have three tenths. Here I have four tenths. So I don't even have to look at the hundredths or the thousandths place. This one has the least tenths."
Math,"So I can put that as the least, or the smallest of the three numbers, 0.343 And now, so I've already used that one, and so I need to compare these two numbers. They have the same number of ones, they have the same number of tenths, so then we move to the hundredths. So here I have two hundredths, here I have four hundredths. This one has less hundredths than this one. So the one on the left is going to be the next smallest number. So then we have 0.424."
Math,"And then, last but not least, this one right over here, it has the same number of ones as everything else. It has more tenths than this middle one, and the same number of tenths as the left one. But then it has, but then it also has more hundredths than the left one right over here. So this is the largest of the numbers, 0.443. And we're done.."
Math,"All right, now let's tackle this together. And the way that I like to do it is I start at the, I guess you could say, the most significant place value or the largest place value, compare the numbers. And then keep moving to the right to smaller and smaller place values. So we can start in the ones place. This number has zero ones, this number has zero ones, this number has zero ones, and that number has zero ones. So the ones place really doesn't help us much. But then we can move to the tenths place."
Math,"This number has 7/10. This number has 0/10, so just from that we know that the second number is less than the first number. This has 7/10, this has 0/10. It doesn't matter what's happening in the places after that, to the right of that. This number over here also has 7/10, just like the first number. And this last number also has 7/10. So we know from comparing the ones and then the tenths place is that this number right over here is the smallest of the four numbers."
Math,"They all have zero ones, but this one also has 0/10. So I'll list that here, 0.074. Now let's move to the hundredths place. So this number has 0/100. We've already used this number. This number has 7/100. And then this number, it might not be obvious, but the hundredths place you can view as being zero, the hundredths place, you can just put a zero there and not change the value. So this also has 0/100."
Math,"So these three numbers, same ones, same tenths, but this number, 0.77, has 7/100, while the other two had 0/100. So this is going to be the largest of our four numbers. This is larger than these other two because of what we see in the hundredths place. It doesn't matter what's happening in the thousandths place or anything beyond that. So we put the 0.77 right over there."
Math,"And now we are tasked, and we've used this number, and now we have to compare these two numbers, which were equal in the ones, tenths, and hundredths place, so we have to go to the thousandths place. This number has 7/1000. This number has 0/1000. So this number is smaller than this first number here. So I'll write this next, 0.7, and then the third smallest, or the next to largest number is this one over here, 0.707, and we're done."
Math,"So the main idea is you wanna compare the most significant place values, the largest places values first, and then based on that, keep moving to the right to compare less and less significant place values.."
Math,"And so, what I want you to do is pause this video, and figure out, are these equal to each other? Or is one of the larger than the other? And if one of them is, which one is larger, and which one is smaller? Pause this video and try to figure that out. All right, now let's try to do this together, and the way that my brain works is, I try to put them into a common representation. So, one way we could do it is we could try to re-write this one on the right as a decimal. So let's do that."
Math,"So, we could re-write this as, it's expressing a certain number of thousandths, so let me just make some blanks for our various placeS. So let's say that's the one's place, and that's our decimal, that's going to be our tenth's place, that's going to be our hundredth's place, and that's going to be our thousandth's place. So, one way to view 307 thousandths is that we have 307 of this place, right over there. So, we could just write the seven there, the zero there, and the three over there."
Math,"This over here would be 307 thousandths, and so we would have no ones. And so when you look at it this way, it's a little bit easier to compare. You can say, ""all right, we have the same number of ones, we have the same number of tenths, let me compare the like one to the like ones."" So, our tenths are equal, but what happens when we get to the hundredths? Here, we have seven hundredths, and here we have zero hundredths. So, this number on the left is going to be larger."
Math,"So, 37 hundredths is greater than 307 thousandths. Another that we could have done this is we could have re-expressed this left number in terms of thousandths. We could've re-written it as, instead of 37 hundredths, we could've just said zero point three seven, and just put another zero on the right, and this is 370 thousandths. I'll write it out. 370 thousandths. And when you look at it this way, once again it's clear that 370 of something is more than 307 of that something."
Math,"So, this quantity on the left is larger. Let's do another example, but I'll use different formats. So, let's say on the left, I'll use decimal format, I'll have zero point six, or six tenths, and then on the right, I'm going to have six times one over a hundred."
Math,"Pause this video and tell me, which of these quantities, if either, are greater, or are they equal to each other? All right, so once again, in order to tackle this, you really just have to think about what are different way to represent them? And really just get to a common representation. And so, I could re-write six tenths and six times one tenth. Six times one tenth."
Math,"And this might be enough to be able to compare the two, because six times one tenth, is that going to be greater than, or less than, or equal to six times a hundredth? Well, a tenth is ten times larger than a hundredth, so because this is ten times larger than that, if you multiply is by six, well, this is going to be a larger quantity."
Math,"So we could go and say, ""Hey, this is greater than that."" Another way that you might have realized that is if you were to express this right quantity as a decimal like this. So, this is six times a hundredth, or six hundredths. So, we could write that's our ones, that's our tenths, and then in our hundredths place, you would have six."
Math,"And if it isn't obvious that this is less than that, you could add a zero here, and this, we would read as 60 hundredths, and 60 hundredths is for sure larger than six hundredths. So, these are all very reasonable ways of re-representing these numbers and putting them in the same format so we can make the comparison and realize the one on the left, actually in both scenarios, is larger than the one on the right.."
Math,"Which bread takes less flour? So the white bread calls for 4/10 of a kilogram, while the recipe of whole wheat bread calls for 0.385 kilograms, or 385/1000 of a kilogram. Now the way I wrote it is important. You always want to line up the decimals when you are comparing, because you want to compare numbers in the same place value. And this is an interesting example of even though the number down here has more digits it doesn't mean that it's necessarily a larger number."
Math,"What we want to do when we compare numbers and this is true whether we're dealing with decimals or not, is we start in the largest place value. We could start in the ones place, 'cause both of these have zero ones. Then we go one place value down, we go to the tenths place. The white bread, it requires 4/10 of flour while in the whole wheat bread we only have 3/10 of flour. So we can stop right there. This has more tenths than this does. It doesn't matter that this has more hundredths and thousandths."
Math,"Those are less significant. They don't add up to as much as what we're dealing with when we look just at the tenths place. So because four is greater than three, and we're in the tenths place we know that white bread takes more flour, but we have to be very careful. They said which bread takes less flour? So it's going to be whole wheat bread. Three is less than four. Let's do another one of these."
Math,A group of fifth graders kept track of the number of hours they spent working on their science project right? Put the students in order from the least to greatest amount of time spent. The student with the least amount of time should be at the top of the list. So pause this video and see if you can do this. And this is actually a screenshot from the Khan Academy exercise. If you're doing the Khan Academy exercise you'd actually be able to click on these and move them around. But let's compare them.
Math,"So as I mentioned in the last example, when you're comparing numbers it's good to line up the place values, so let's do that. So Adam is 5.5. Aviv is five, and Jenny is 5.17. So once again, start at the largest place value. Start at the ones. They all have exactly five ones, so then we move to the next place value. In this case, we're going to go to the tenths place. So when we look at the tenths place, interesting things are going on. Aviv has no tenths. It's a blank here, but you could do this as 5.0."
Math,"So Aviv has the fewest tenths, then comes Jenny with only 1/10 and then Adam has 5/10. So that tells us enough so that we can order the three. We don't even have to look at the hundredths place because the tenths here are different. So the least number of tenths is Aviv, so that's going to be Aviv is the least. They all have the same number of ones, but Aviv has the least tenths. Then comes Jenny."
Math,"Jenny, once again, they all have the same number of ones but then Jenny has less tenths than Adam, and then comes Adam. Adam has the most tenths. It doesn't matter that Jenny also has 7/100. Notice you could view this as 17/100 which is going to be less than 5/10 which could also be viewed as 50/100. So the general way to think about it, start at the most significant, the largest place value, compare. If things are equal, go to the next place value."
Math,"When things are different, then you have enough information to start ordering them.."
Math,"then say say what is 12.5 rounded to the nearest 10? Well, what's cool about this is you can see on the number line that our tens are in this blue hash."
Math,"So we have 10 and then 20 and we're between 10 and 20 and which one are we closest to? Which is literally the nearest 10? Well, you can see we are closer to 10 than we are to 20 so you would say 10, and this helps us build an intuition for what rounding to the nearest 10 even means because you might know a rule like, hey look, you go one place less than the tens place, which would be the one's place and if it's less than five there you round down to 10. If it's five or greater you round up to 20."
Math,"But you see why over here, we are just closer to 10. Let's do another example here. So here it says drag the point to 0.136. So this is 0.13, this is 0.14, so this is 13 hundredths and this is 14 hundredths, now let's see. There's one, two, there, four, five, six, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. So these are, you could think of it as the ten thousandths between these two hundredths. So we want to go 13 hundredths and then another six thousandths. So let's see, we go one, two, three, four, five, six."
Math,"Just like that, and then they say what is this number? 136 thousandths or 0.136 rounded to the nearest hundredth. Well, we have our hundredths in blue here, and which one are we closer to? Well, we're closer to 14 hundredths, 0.14. And that's consistent with what we've seen in other cases where you look at the thousandths place and if it's five or greater you round up. In this case, you would round up to 14 hundredths. Let's do a few more examples here."
Math,"So let's say that, so they're asking us which point is at 44.197 on the number line? So let's see, that's going to be between 44 and 45, so it's right over here, 44.197, so that would be point C. And then they say, what is 44.197 rounded to the nearest whole number? Well, there's a couple of ways to think about it. You could just look at the tenths place and say look, that's less than five so we round down to 44 or a more intuitive way of thinking about it is like look, point C is the number we care about."
Math,"That is 44.197. What's the closest whole number to it? Is it closer to 44 or is it closer to 45? Well, it's clearly closer to 44, so that's another reason why 44 makes a lot of sense. Let's do another example. Let's say that we want to, so they say, what is A rounded to the nearest thousandth? What is A rounded to the nearest hundredth? So A is right over here, let's get our bearings. So 0.7, that's seven hundredths. This is eight hundredths right over here."
Math,"And then between them, let's see, this looks like it's zero, so you can view this as 70 thousandths, 71 thousandths, 72 thousandths, 73 thousandths, 74 thousandths, and so on. So this is between 78 thousands and 79 thousandths. So if we round to the nearest thousandth it looks closer, in fact, it's definitely closer to 78 thousandths than it is to 79 thousandths. So I would say this is 0.078, or 78 thousandths. That's closer, that's the nearest thousandth."
Math,"What is A rounded to the nearest hundredth? Well, what are the hundredths that it's in-between? It's in-between seven hundredths and eight hundredths. And which one is it closer to? Well, it's closer to eight hundredths, 0.08."
Math,"So once again, the whole point of this video is to appreciate when people say round to the nearest whole number, to the nearest 10, to the nearest thousandth, to the nearest hundredth, you can think of it on a number line and just say, well, what is the closest hundredth to it? Or what hundredth is it closest to? Which thousandth is it closest to on the number line?."
Math,"And we need to round to the nearest tenth. So what's the tenth place? The tenths place is right here. This right here represents 5 tenths. This is the ones place, this is the tenths place, this is the hundredths place, and this is the thousandths place right here. So we need to round to the nearest tenth. So if we round up, this will be 9.6. If we round down, this will be 9.5."
Math,"And just like regular rounding, when we're not dealing with decimals, you move to one spot, or you look at one place to the right or one place lower, I guess, and you say is that 5 or larger? If it is, you round up, if it isn't, you round down. 6 is definitely 5 or larger, so we want to round up. So this 9.564 becomes 9.6, or we can call this nine and six tenths. And then we're done!."
Math,"So the amount of cheese once again is 0.432 pounds and just remember the places here. This is 4/10, so that's the tenths place. This is the hundredths place, and that's an S there, so tenths, hundredths, and this right over here is thousandths, thousandths place. So we wanna round to the nearest tenth. So we're gonna round to the nearest tenth. We go one place to the right. If it's five or larger, we round up. This would become a five."
Math,"If it's less than five, well, if it's less than five, which is the case here, we're gonna round down to just 4/10 even. So because three is less than five, we are going to round down, and we're going to get 0.400, or we could write that as 0.4, or we could write that as 4/10 of a pound. Let's do another one. Eliza's pet snail traveled 2.197 meters in one day. Round the distance to the nearest hundredth. So pause this video and see if you can do that. Round the distance to the nearest hundredth."
Math,"So it's 2.197. This is the hundredths place right over here, and so if we're gonna round to the nearest hundredth, we're gonna go one place to the right. If this one place to the right is five or greater, we're gonna round up, and seven is five or greater, so we are going to round up . Now this is interesting 'cause if you round a nine up, you get to 10, but you can't put a whole 10 right over here."
Math,"So one way to think about it is you have a 19 here, and so if you round up, you're gonna go to a 20, or another way to think about it. If you round the nine up, you're gonna go to the next tenth. So this is going to be 2 point, you could view this as 19/100 or 19/100 and 7/1,000, and so now we're gonna round up to 20/100, so 2.20."
Math,"We're rounding to the nearest hundredth, which you could write as 2.2, but to make it clear that you're rounding to the nearest hundredth, you're gonna write 2.20, and later in your life, this actually might matter to actually show what you're rounding to. Let's do another example here. Cassandra spends 6.75 hours each day at school. Round the amount of time to the nearest hour."
Math,"Alright, so 6.75, so you might be a little confused, and actually, I encourage you to pause the video again and try to solve it on your own. So you might be a little confused 'cause they're not saying round it to the nearest tenth or hundredth or one or 10 or 100. They're saying to the nearest hour, but in this case, the hour is the ones place. So if we're gonna round to the nearest hour, this is another way of saying round to the nearest one. So we're gonna round to the nearest one."
Math,"We go one place to the right. We go to look at the tenths place. If it's five or larger, we round up. Well, seven is five or larger, so we round up to the next hour, which is going to be seven, so seven hours. If this was 6.49999, once again, if we're rounding to the nearest hour, we go one place to the right. It doesn't matter that we have all these nines here. We'd say, hey, look, four is less than five. Therefore, we should round down, round down, and you would round down to the next hour."
Math,"Well, the next hour that's below 6.499999, nine, nine, nine, nine, is six hours, but in this case, we had a seven in the tenths place, which is definitely greater than or equal to five, and so we'd round up to the next hour, which is seven hours.."
Math,"So I encourage you to pause the video and say and think about how would you represent 1/5 as a decimal. Well, there's a bunch of ways that you could think about it. You could divide five into one. You could say that this is equal to one divided by five and if you did that, you actually would get the right answer but there's a simpler way of thinking about this even in your head."
Math,"You could say, well, let me see if I can represent this as a certain number of tenths 'cause if you know how many tenths, we know how to represent that as a decimal. Well, to go from fifths to tenths, you have to multiply the denominator by two. So let's multiply the numerator by two as well. So 1/5, one times two is the same thing as 2/10 and we know how to represent that in decimal notation. That's going to be 0.2. This is the tenths place. So we have exactly 2/10. Now, let's do 1/4. Same idea."
Math,"How could I represent this as a decimal? Well, at first, you might say, well, can I represent this as a certain number of tenths and you could do it this way but 10 isn't a multiple of four so let's see if we can do it in terms of hundredths 'cause 100 is a multiple of four. Well, to go from four to 100, you have to multiply by 25. So let's multiply the numerator by 25 to get an equivalent fraction. So one times 25 is 25."
Math,"So 1/4 is equal to 25/100 and we can represent that in decimal notation as 25/100 which we could also consider 2/10 and 5/100. Now, let's do 1/2. Same exact idea. Well, 10 is a multiple of two so we can think about this in terms of tenths. So to go from two to 10, we multiply by five. So let's multiply the numerator by five as well. So 1/2 is equal to 5/10 which if you wanna represent as a decimal is 0.5, 5/10."
Math,"Now, why is this useful? Well, one, you're gonna see these fractions show up a lot in life and you're gonna go both ways. If you see 2/10 or 20/100 to be able to immediately recognize, hey, that's 1/5 or 25/100, hey, that's 1/4 or 1/4, that's 25/100. 1/2 is 0.5 or 0.5 is 1/2 and it's not just useful for these three fractions. It's useful for things that are multiple of these three fractions."
Math,"For example, if someone said, quick, what is 3/5 represented as a decimal? Well, in your brain, you could say, well, 3/5, that's just going to be three times 1/5 and I know that 1/5 is 2/10 so that's gonna be three times 2/10 which is, well, three times two is six so three times 2/10 is 6/10. So really quick, you're able to say, hey, that's 3/5 is 6/10 and you could have gone the other way around. You could have said 6/10 is equal to two times, is equal to three times 2/10 and 2/10 is 1/5."
Math,"So this is gonna be equal to three times 1/5 and once again, these are just things that you'll get comfortable with the more that you get practice. Let's do another one. Let's say you wanted to represent, let's say you wanted to represent, let me do it another way. 0.75 as a fraction. Pause the video, try to do it yourself."
Math,"Well, you might immediately recognize that 75 is three times 25 so 75/100 is equal to three times 25/100 and 25/100 we already know is 1/4 so this is equal to three times 1/4 which is equal to 3/4 and over time, you won't have to do all of this in your head. You'll just recognize 75/100, that's 3/4 because 25/100 is 1/4 and now let's do, let's say we have, let's say we have 2.5 and we wanna represent that as a fraction. Well, there's a bunch of ways that you could do this."
Math,"You could say, well, this is five times 0.5 and that's going to be five times 1/2. Well, that's going to be 5/2. It's an improper fraction but it's a fraction. And so once again, the whole point here and you might already be familiar with the different ways of converting between fractions and decimals but if you recognize 1/5, 1/4, 1/2, it's going to be a lot easier. Notice if you did it the other way around it'd be a little bit more work."
Math,"If I said, let me convert 3/5 to a decimal, well, then you would have to divide five into three. Five into three and you'd say, okay, five goes into three zero times so let's put a decimal here. Now, let's go to 30. Five goes into 30 six times. Six times five is 30. You subtract and then you get no remainder. So this wasn't a ton of work but this one, the reason why I like this one, not only is it faster but it gives you a better intuition for what actually is going on.."
Math,"is approximately equal to, this little squiggly equal sign means approximately equal to, so try to estimate this and pick the right choice. Pause the video and try to do that. Alright, now let's work through this together. We could work this out by hand, but the whole goal here is estimation, so if I were doing this in my head I'd say, well, look, 12.93 is a little bit less than 13, and 6.1 is a little bit more than six."
Math,"And it's actually nice because when I rounded I went down on this number and I went up on this number. I went up 700ths to get to 13 and I went down 1/10th to get to six, so I feel good when I add them up that we're going to get pretty close to the actual answer. 13 plus six is equal to 19, and lucky for us that that is one of the choices. There's multiple ways that you could try to estimate things. For example, you could do a little finer of an estimation."
Math,"You'd say, this is approximately 12.9 plus 6.1, and then you'd say, 12 plus six is 18, and then, 9/10ths plus 1/10th is another one, so you'd say this is 18 plus one, and you'd say, okay, that, once again gets me pretty close to 19, or, this gets me to 19. Let's do another example. Here we're told five plus one plus 4.91 is approximately equal to what, so, pause this video and see if you can figure that out. Try to estimate it, try to do it without any paper."
Math,"The way I would do it is actually very similar to the way we just did the last one. 5.1 is approximately equal to five, is approximately equal to five, and 4.91 is also approximately equal to five. I rounded to the nearest whole number in either case, and so, that would be equal to 10. Once again, it makes sense because we rounded down here and we rounded up here, we rounded down to go from 5.1 to five, and we rounded up to go from 4.91 to five."
Math,"If you're rounding down in both cases, or rounding up in both cases your estimate might get a little bit further from your actual answer, so you might want to be a little bit careful. Alright, so in this last example, once again, pause the video and see if you can work through it on your own. We're just going to do the same thing here. This is going to be approximately equal to three plus, I rounded down, 3.14, rounded to the nearest whole number, three. 5.92 rounded to the nearest whole number is six."
Math,"And once again, just like I mentioned in the previous ones, this is good because I am rounding down from 3.14 to three, I took away 1400ths, and I add 800ths to 5.92, so it's going to get me reasonably close to my actual answer, and so, three plus six is equal to nine, which is, indeed, one of the answers here."
Math,"And this is actually interesting, you're not always going to see a multiple choice, so if you're trying to estimate things, but in this case, you know that just three plus five is going to be eight, and so this can't be the choice. Then you're going to have eight plus whatever 1400ths plus 9200ths is, and you know that's more than one, so you know our answer's going to be a little bit over nine. Once again, nine is a good approximation.."
Math,"or we could read the second number as five and 7/10. Pause this video, and see if you can do this. The way that my brain tries to tackle this is, I try to separate the whole numbers from the tenths, so you can view this as being the same thing as four plus five plus 7/10. All I did here is I broke up the five and 7/10 into five plus 7/10, and the reason why my brain likes to do that is because I can then say okay four plus five, that's just going to be equal to nine, and then I just have to add the 7/10."
Math,"So it's gonna be nine and 7/10 which I can rewrite, this is going to be equal to nine and 7/10. Nine and 7/10 I could write as 9.7. Even though in future videos we're going to learn other ways of adding decimals, especially larger, more complicated decimals, this is still how my brain adds four plus 5.7. Especially if I need to do it in my head. I say okay, four plus five is nine, and then I have that 7/10, so it's going to be nine and 7/10 or 9.7."
Math,"Now let's do another example where both numbers involve a decimal. Let's say I want to add 6.3 to 7.4. So 6.3 plus 7.4. Once again, pause this video and try to work through it on your own. Well my brain does it the same way. I break up the whole numbers and the decimals. Once again, there's many different ways of adding decimals, but this is just one way that seems to work. Especially for decimals like this."
Math,"So we could view this as six and 3/10, so I'm breaking up the 6.3, the six and 3/10, into six plus 3/10 plus seven and 4/10. Seven plus 4/10, and then this you can view as, so you could view this as six plus seven, six plus seven, plus, plus 3/10, plus 3/10 plus 4/10, plus 4/10. If you add the ones here, you have six ones and seven ones, that's going to be equal to 13, and then 3/10 and 4/10."
Math,"If you have three of something and then you add four of that, that's going to be 7/10, and we would write 7/10 as 0.7. Seven in the tenths place. Then what's 13 plus 7/10? Well that is going to be 13. This is going to be equal to 13.7. 13.7, and we are done. Let me do one more example that will get a little bit, a little bit more involved. So let me delete all of these. Let's say I wanted to add 6.3 to, and I'm gonna add that to 2 point, 2.9. Pause the video and see if you can figure this out."
Math,"Let's do the same thing. This is going to be six and 3/10, so six plus 3/10, plus two, plus 9/10, or you could view this as six plus two, so I'll put all my ones together. Six plus two, and then I'll put my tenths together, plus 3/10, plus 3/10. Plus 9/10, plus 9/10. And so the six plus two is pretty straightforward. That is going to be equal to eight. Now what's 3/10 plus 9/10? This is gonna get a little bit interesting. 3/10 plus 9/10, and I could write it out."
Math,"I could say this is three tenths, this is nine tenths. Well 3/10 plus 9/10 is equal to 12/10. This is going to be 12/10, but how do we write 12/10 as a number? Well 12/10 is the same thing as 10/10 plus 2/10. The reason why I broke it up this way is 10/10 is one whole, so this is going to be equal to one. When you add these two together, it's 12/10 which is the same thing as one and 2/10. So one plus 2/10 or, well let me just write it that way."
Math,"This I can rewrite as plus one plus 2/10, and then I think you see where this is going. I could add the eight and the one, and I get nine and 2/10. So nine and 2/10. So it's going to be 9.2. The reason why this one was a little bit more interesting is I added the ones, I got six plus two is eight, but then when I added the tenths, I got something that was more than a whole. I got 12/10 which is one and 2/10, and so I added one more whole to the eight to get nine, and then I had those 2/10 leftover."
Math,"This is really good to understand because in the future when you're adding decimals, you'll be doing stuff like carrying from one place to another, and this is essentially what we did. When we added the 3/10 plus the 9/10, we got 12/10, and so we added an extra whole, and then we had the leftover 2/10. Hopefully, that makes some sense.."
Math,"Well the way that my brain tries to tackle it, is it says, alright, I have four and 22 hundredths, and 61 and 37 hundredths, how about I add the four plus the 61, so it's gonna be four plus 61, and then separately let me add the 22 hundredths to the 37 hundredths, so then I'm gonna add 22 hundredths plus 37 hundredths, and so four plus 61 is going to be equal to 65, and then 22 hundredths plus 37 hundredths, well, what's 22 plus 37? Let's see, 20 plus 30 is 50, and then two plus seven is nine, and so it's going to be 59 hundredths."
Math,"So 59 hundredths, so it's gonna be 65 and 59 hundredths, which we can write as 65 and 59 hundredths."
Math,"Now like I've mentioned in previous videos, there's many different ways of adding decimals, and in future videos we'll learn arguably faster ways of doing it, but I wanna show you multiple ways so you get a sense of ways to approach it, and this is the way that I do it in my head if someone said hey, something cost $61.37, and then you had to pay $4.22 in tax, how much did you have to pay in total, this is how I would actually do it in my head, I would get $65.59. Let's do another example."
Math,"So let's say that we have three and 53 hundredths, and we wanna add that to four and 72 hundredths, like always, pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own."
Math,"So like we did in the previous example, we can say alright, we could add the ones, three ones plus four ones, so it's gonna be three plus four, and then we could add the hundredths, and we could say plus 53 hundredths, plus 53 hundredths, plus 72 hundredths, plus 72 hundredths, now the three plus four is pretty straightforward, that's just going to be ..."
Math,"Yup, blue color, this is just going to be equal to seven, but what is 53 hundredths plus 72 hundredths? Well, what's 53 plus 72? I'm going to write it this way, this is 53 hundredths, hundredths, and this is 72 hundredths, well, three plus two is going to be equal to five, and then 50 plus 70 is equal to 120, so this is going to be 125 hundredths, 125 hundredths, so how we write 125 hundredths as a decimal or just as a number? Well, there's a couple of ways to think about it, you could view this as 100 hundredths, hundredths, plus 25 hundredths, plus 25 hundredths, and the reason why I picked 100 hundredths, is because 100 hundredths make a whole, plus 25 hundredths, and so 100 hundredths is just going to be one, so this is going to be one plus 25 hundredths, so I could write this one plus 0.25, and remember, I'm adding that to the seven here, so it's gonna be seven, plus the one, plus the 25 hundredths, so when we added the 53 hundredths plus the 72 hundredths, we got 125 hundredths, which is the same thing as one and 25 hundredths, now, the one, we could add in the ones to the other ones, and so this is going to be seven plus one, is equal to eight, eight and 25 hundredths, so 8.25."
Math,"Now, I'm going to introduce you a little bit to how people might tackle this more systematically, and I want you to think about how this is the exact same thing that we just did."
Math,"So what you're going to see in the future is people are gonna say oh you line up the decimals, so 3.53 plus 4.72, and the reason why people say line up the decimals is so that you're adding the right places to the right places, 4.72, and then they say alright, we'll just go place by place and add it up, which is essentially what we just did without doing it as organized of a way here, and I did it this way so that you really get the understanding of what's going on."
Math,"But you could say alright, I have three hundredths plus two hundredths, so I'm adding in the hundredths place, so three hundredths plus two hundredths is five hundredths, and then you could say okay, then I have 50 hundredths plus 70 hundredths, which I did over here, or you could view this as five tenths plus seven tenths, and five tenths and seven tenths is going to be equal to 12 tenths, but you can't write 12 tenths in the tenths place, but what you can do, so five plus seven is going to be 12 tenths, but 12 tenths is the same thing as one and two tenths, so you can write the two tenths in the tenths place, and then you take the one and you put it in the ones place, so five tenths plus seven tenths is one and two tenths, and then you add the ones up, and so you get one plus three plus four is eight, so it's eight and two tenths and five hundredths, or eight and 25 hundredths, or 8.25, the exact same thing any way that you try to tackle it, but hopefully it makes sense what's actually going on, you're adding hundredths to hundredths, tenths to tenths, ones to ones, and when, say you add tenths to tenths, and you get something that's larger than one, well, that part that is a whole number, you can put in the ones place, and we'll get much much more practice with this in future videos.."
Math,"Alright, now let's work through this together. Now there is many different ways to add decimals. And you'll learn more systematic, faster ways of doing it in the future, but I'll show you a few ways that my brain might think about it. One way to think about it is you could say that this is 53/100. You could read this as either 5/10 and 3/100, or 53/100. You could say this is 53/100. Hundredths. And to that you're going to add 42/100. 42/100."
Math,"And so if I have 53 of something and I'm gonna add 42 of that same something to it, what am I going to get? Well what's 53 plus 42? Well in my head I say well 50 plus 40 is 90, and three plus two is five. It's going to be 95/100. 95/100. And if I wanted to write that as a pure number, I would write that as 0.95, which I could write as 95/100, hundredths, or 9/10 and 5/100. Now the other way we could've thought about it is we could've broken these numbers up."
Math,"We could've said that this first number is 5/10 plus 3/100, hundredths. And then the second number, we could've rewritten as 4/10 plus 2/100. Let me make sure of my decimals. Plus 2/100. And then we could've separately added the tenths and the hundredths. So you have 5/10 plus 4/10, so 5/10 plus 4/10, and then you could separately add 3/100 plus 2/100."
Math,"So 3/100, I have a little trouble saying that, plus 2/100, and so what do I get? Well 5/10 and 4/10, and we've done this in previous videos, if I have five of something and I add four of it, that's gonna be 9/10. So it's gonna be 9/10, and then the 3/100 plus 2/100. Well that's going to be 5/100. So plus 0.05. And then 9/10 plus 5/100 is gonna be, I know I'm saying hundredths kinda strange, is going to be 9/10 and 5/100, which you could also say as 95/100. Let's do another example."
Math,"One that's a little bit more involved. Let's say I want to add 68/100 to 33/100. What is this going to be? And like always, pause the video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well there's a couple of ways to think about it. One way we could split up the tenths and the hundredths, actually let's do it that way. We could rewrite this first number as 6/10 plus 8/100, and the second number we could write as 3/10 plus 3/100. Let me do that in that orange color. 3/10 plus... Plus 3/10 plus 3/100."
Math,"So if I add the 6/10 and the 3/10, so let me just do that. I'm gonna write every step here. If you're doing this in your head or if you're doing this on paper you wouldn't necessarily write every step here. Those are the tenths. And then separately I'm gonna add the hundredths. Plus 8/100, plus 3/100. Plus 3/100. 6/10 plus 3/10, we've done this in previous videos, that's hopefully pretty straightforward by this point. If it's not, I encourage you to review some of those earlier videos."
Math,"That's going to be 9/10. If I have six of something and then I add three of them, in this case we're talking about tenths, I'm gonna get nine of them, so 9/10. And so what's this going to be? Well you could view this is as 8/100. 8/100 plus 3/100. If I have eight of something and I add three of something, that's gonna get 11 of that something. 11/100. How do we write 11/100 as a decimal? Well one way to write it, you could just view this as 0.11. This is 11/100. Many people would read this as 11/100."
Math,"Or you could view this as equaling 10/100, 10/100 plus 1/100. Hundredth. And 10/100 right over here is 1/10. You could view this as 1/10 and 1/100. 1/10 and 1/100. When you add everything together, what do you get? Well you get 9/10, plus 1/10, plus 1/100. Well now this is gonna get interesting still, so let's see. Let me actually rewrite this. It's gonna be 9/10, and this one let me write it plus 1/10, plus that 1/100 leftover. Plus that 1/100."
Math,"What is this going to be? 9/10 and 1/10, that's going to be, 9/10 and 1/10 is going to be 10/10. 10/10, which is the same thing as one whole. This is just going to be equal to one. It's going to be one plus 1/100. It's going to be one and 1/100, and we are done. As I keep mentioning in future videos we're gonna learn maybe faster ways of doing this. Maybe ways that you might be able to do it a little bit more automatically."
Math,"But it's really important to think about what we just went here and how we were able to think, okay 11/100 is the same thing as a tenth and a hundredth, and then taking that tenth, and then adding it to the 9/10 that we already had and say, hey that's whole. In the future, we're gonna be doing things like carrying with decimals, but this is essentially what is happening underneath conceptually. It's really important you get a sense of that before you learn the faster methods.."
Math,"is approximately equal to what? This squiggly-looking equal sign you can view as roughly equal to or approximately equal to. So, pause this video and see if you can figure it out. And, you shouldn't really need paper for it. The whole point of estimation is to be able to do it quickly and get close to the answer. You don't have to get the exact answer. Well, let's think about it. The way my brain would do it is 12.93-- Let's just round each of them to the nearest whole number."
Math,"So, this is going to be approximately 12.93 if I round to the nearest one or to the nearest whole number, I'm gonna round up to 13. And 6.1, if I round to the nearest whole number, I'm gonna round down to six. So, I could say this is roughly 13 minus six which is equal to seven, and that is indeed one of the choices there."
Math,"And, when you're doing estimation, you might have gotten a slightly different result, but I'm guessing that the way that this question was set up, that if you do any type of reasonable estimate, that you're going to have a number that is closer to seven than any of the other choices. And to be clear, sometimes you could do this in your head. For example, 12.93 minus 6.1, you could say 12 minus six is going to be six. And then you have 93 hundredths minus, you could do this as 10 hundredths."
Math,"So, it's gonna be 93 hundredths minus 10 hundredths is 83 hundredths, plus .83. So, just like that, you could do something like this and say, alright, the answer here is gonna be 6.83 exactly. And that, once again, is approximately equal to seven. But, the whole point of this exercise is to get comfortable estimating things because a lot of times in life you don't need the exact answer. You just need a rough answer, just to know the ball park of what you're talking about. Let's do another example."
Math,"So here, we are asked what is 56.75 minus 46.9 approximately equal to? Once again, pause this video and try to work it out. Well, here I'm gonna do the same thing. I'm just gonna round each to the nearest whole number and then subtract. And, I'm gonna write it out, but you could do this in your head. So 56.75 rounded to the nearest whole number is 57 round up, minus 46.9, I would also round up to 47. And, in our head this is pretty straightforward. This is going to be equal to ten."
Math,"And, that is indeed is one of the choices. And, normally in life when you're estimating, you don't have choices like this. I guess this is just the easiest way for-- This if off of the Khan Academy exercises. So, for someone to be able to grade it because estimations can be different, so you have to pick the one that's at least closest to what you came up as your estimate. Now, let's do one more example. And, I will write in purple. Alright. So, pause the video again. See if you can figure this out."
Math,"Alright, so 49.7, I'm gonna round up to 50, 4.16 I'm gonna round down to four. So, that's going to be approximately equal to 30-- Oh sorry, that's gonna be approximately equal to 46. And, we do indeed see 46 as one of the choices right over there. So, hopefully you feel comfortable. There's nothing fancy going on here."
Math,The whole point of this is to just get comfortable doing things like this in your head and estimating and rounding numbers so you can get a ball park sense of what this difference is going to be..
Math,"Pause this video and see if you can calculate this. So there is multiple ways to tackle this. One way is you could say, ""Look, this is the same thing ""as two minus one ""minus 2/10."" This is two minus one and 2/10. So we're subtracting one, and we're subtracting 2/10. Now two minus one is pretty straightforward to compute. Two minus one is going to be one, and then we need to subtract 2/10 from that. So one is the same thing as 10/10. We could say this is 10/10. 10, write it this way."
Math,"10/10, and we're gonna subtract 2/10. What is that gonna give us? Well, that's going to give us, if we have 10/10, and we take away 2/10, that's going to give us 8/10. Lemme write it down here. 8/10, which is the same thing as 0.8, or 8/10. One way to think about this is if you're subtracting 0.2 from one, if you view this one as a 1.0, instead of expressing this as one, one, and 0/10, we are thinking about this as zero ones and 10/10."
Math,"And when you think about it as zero ones and 10/10, well, 10/10 minus 2/10, it's easier to then think about, well, 10 of something minus two of something is gonna be eight of something. It's gonna be 8/10. Now we can also visualize this on a number line, so for example, let me draw a number line here, and so zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. That's one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. That is two, so we're starting at two, and we're subtracting one and 2/10."
Math,"So one way to think about it is we first subtracted one. We first subtracted one, and then we subtracted 2/10, and that got us to the point 8/10 on the number line. Another way to think about this, and the whole point here is to see multiple strategies and for you to think about what strategy you like the most and to realize they all get you to the same place."
Math,"If you're thinking about it in a reasonable way, is you could use, what's the difference between two and 1.2? So 1.2 sits here on the number line, so what's the difference between two and one and 2/10? Another way to think about it is how many tenths do you have to add to one and 2/10 to get to two? Well, if you've already got 2/10, you need to add another 8/10 to get to the next whole. So you have to add 8/10, or you have to add 0.8."
Math,"So the difference between two and 1.2, the difference between two and 1.2 is equal to 0.8. Let's do a few more examples that get a little bit more involved. So let's say we wanna calculate what 3.8 minus 1.5 is. Pause the video and see if you can calculate this. Well, just like before, we could view this as three minus one, so we're subtracting the ones plus 8/10 minus 5/10. Notice we have three and 8/10 minus one and 5/10, minus one and minus 5/10."
Math,"And so now we can figure out, okay, three minus one, that's just going to be equal to two, and then 8/10 minus 5/10, well, that is 3/10, and so this is going to be two and 3/10, which of course we could write as 2.3. That seemed pretty straightforward. Let's do one that's a little bit more involved. Let's say we wanna calculate four and 5/10 or 4.5, minus two and 8/10 or 2.8. Pause the video and see if you can calculate this. So you might wanna do the exact same thing."
Math,"You might say, ""Okay, well, this is the same thing. ""Let's think about the ones."" This is four minus two plus 5/10 minus 8/10. Four and 5/10 minus two and minus 8/10, minus two and 8/10. That's exactly what we have up here. Then you would say, ""Alright, four minus two, ""that is two."" But then you get to 5/10 minus 8/10, and there's multiple ways to tackle this, but you might say, ""Oh, how do I take away 8/10 ""if I've only got 5/10 here?"" And there's a bunch of strategies that you could think about."
Math,"You could say, ""Hey, what if I can get ""some more tenths here?"" So this is 5/10 minus 8/10. What if I could get some more tenths here? The best way I can think of it is like what if I were to break up these ones because one is 10/10? So I could view a two as one plus one, or I could view this as one plus 10/10. So if you view a two as one and 10/10, you can then just add those."
Math,"You could then figure out what is 10/10 plus 5/10 minus 8/10? What is that going to be? Well, this is a little bit more straightforward. 10/10 plus 5/10 is going to be 15/10, and if you have 15/10 and you take away eight of them, you're going to be left with 7/10. So this gets us to one plus 7/10, so all of this when you compute it, that is 7/10, which I could write as 0.7, which is equal to, so this is equal to one and 7/10. Now there's other strategies that you could do here."
Math,"One strategy that, and this is the one that I typically do in my head is I write this as 4.5 minus 2.5 minus 0.3, or four and 5/10 minus two and 5/10 minus 3/10. Now why did I write it this way? Because I find this pretty straightforward to compute, and then once I get that answer, I just have to take away 3/10."
Math,"So for example, well, if I have 5/10 here, and I'm taking away 5/10, those are gonna knock each other out, and so I'm just gonna be left with four minus two, which is gonna be two, and then I have to take away the 3/10. This is a pretty straightforward way of doing it in your head. So what's 3/10 less than two? Well, you can visualize a number line in your head. Well, that's gonna be one and 7/10, one and 7/10, and if this feels strange how I got, oh, one, I wrote 7/100, one and 7/10."
Math,"And if this seems strange how I got there that fast, just think about this. This is the same thing as one plus one minus 3/10, and this one right over here is the same thing as 10/10, and so 10/10 minus 3/10. That over there is going to be, that is going to be 7/10, so it's going to be one and 7/10, which is what we got before."
Math,"So the whole point here is to appreciate there's multiple strategies for subtracting decimals, some that you can do a little bit more automatically, but it's really good to think about what's going on in your head. And some strategies are actually better in your head than on paper, or at least more easy in your head.."
Math,"So try to pause this video and figure this out first before we work through it together. All right. Well, let's just rewrite it. Let's rewrite it. And when I rewrite it, I like to line up the decimals. This one it's a little intuitive. We have 8.09. Just like that, and now we're ready to subtract. And we want to subtract 9 hundredths from 7 hundredths. Well, we don't have enough hundredths up here so let's move over here. Let's see if we can do some regrouping so we always have a higher number on top."
Math,"So over here we want to subtract 0 tenths from 5 tenths so we have enough tenths over here. So let's regroup. So instead of 5 tenths, I'm going to have 4 tenths, and then I'm going to give that other tenth, which is the same thing as 10 hundredths over here, so this becomes 17 hundredths. 17 minus 9 is 8. 4 minus 0 is 4. And then I have 9 minus 8 is 1. So this is going to be 1.48.."
Math,"And I encourage you to pause this video and try it on your own first, and then we can think about whether we did it the same way. So let's just rewrite it, aligning the decimal and the different place values. So 10.1 minus-- the 3 is in the ones place, so I'll put it right under the 0-- 3.93. Now, let's just try to calculate this. Now, before we subtract, we want all the numbers on top to be larger than the numbers on the bottom. And we don't even have a number here. We could stick a 0 here."
Math,"Let me do that in a different color here. We could stick a 0 here. 10.1 is the same thing as 10.10, but we still face an issue 0 is less than 3. 1 is less than 9. 0 is less than 3. So we're going to do a little bit of regrouping. So let's do that regrouping. So we could take a 10 away, one 10 away, and then one 10 is the same thing as 10 ones. So I could write a 10 in the ones place. And I could take one of those ones away so I'm going to have nine ones, and give that one to the tenths place."
Math,"Well, one is 10 tenths. 10 tenths plus 1 tenth is going to be 11 tenths. Now, I could take one of those tenths away and give it to the hundredths place. 1 tenth is 10 hundredths. And now I have a higher digit in the numerator, or at least as equal in the numerator as I have in the denominator. So 10 minus 3 is 7. 10 minus 9 is 1. I have the decimal. 9 minus 3 is 6. And then I have nothing over here. So 10.1 minus 3.93, 6.17.."
Math,"what is that going to be? Pause this video and see if you can compute this. There's a bunch of ways to think about it. One way to think about it is this is 69/100. Hundredths. And from that we are subtracting 34/100. Hundredths. And so this boils down to, I have 69 of something, in this case hundredths, in this case hundredths, and I'm gonna take away 34 of them. So what am I left with? Well what's 69 minus 34? Well nine ones minus, or I should say nine minus four is gonna be five."
Math,"And 60 minus 30 is going to be 30. So I'm left with 35/100. Hundredths. Which I can write as 0.35. Now another way I could think about it is I could break up the tenths, and then the leftover hundredths. So I could view this as 6/10, let me circle that a little bit better, 6/10 minus 3/10. So 6/10 minus 3/10 plus... Plus 9/100 minus 4/100. So plus 9/100 minus 4/100. And we're gonna get the same answer, so that is 6/10 and I take away three of them."
Math,"That's gonna give me 3/10, or I could just write that as 0.3. And then two that I would have to add 9/100 minus 4/100 is 5/100. So 0.05. So 3/10 and 5/100 is going to be 35/100, or we could just write it this way. We could write it as 3/10. We have a three in the tenth's place. And 5/100. Let me do that blue color. And 5/100. Or we could view that as 35/100. However way, these are different ways of thinking about subtracting these hundredths. Let's do another example. Let's say we want to compute."
Math,"We would like to compute, and this actually will probably be a little bit more straightforward, three and 43/100, minus two. What is this going to be equal to? Pause the video and see if you can figure it out. Well it might jump out at you that this is the same thing as three plus 43/100, minus two. And so you can just look at the ones. You could look at the wholes. We have three wholes, and we're gonna take away two of them. So we're gonna be left with one whole, and we still have this 43/100."
Math,"So we still have this 43/100, so it's gonna be one and 43/100, or we could write that as 1.43. That one maybe was a little bit more straightforward. Now let's kind of combine the ideas of these last two examples, and do one that might seem a little bit more daunting. Let's say that we want to subtract, we want to figure out what 65.79 minus 42.58 is. Pause the video and see if you can figure this out. Multiple ways to do this. You could separate the whole numbers, so you could say this is 65 minus 42."
Math,"65 minus 42, plus, and then think about the, and then think about the hundredths. Plus 79/100, so 79/100, minus 58/100. Minus 58/100. And I just, I'll rewrite this in words just to reinforce. This is 79 of something, 79/100. You could say it's 7/10 and 9/100, but it's the same thing as 79/100. Hundredths. This is 58/100. Hundredths. And so 65 minus 42. Five minus two go in the ones. We're gonna get three. And then 60 minus 40 is equal to 20. So we have 23 plus... Now 79/100 minus 58/100, 70 minus 50 is 20."
Math,"And nine minus eight is one. So this is gonna be 21/100, which we can write as 0.21, 21/100. And so when we compute this it'll be 23 and 21/100. This is just one way to tackle it. There are multiple ways that you could try to tackle a subtraction problem like this.."
Math,"I'll tell you the way that my head likes to do this. I would view this as the same thing as eight and 38 hundredths, and then I would subtract four and 38 hundredths. The reason why I pick 38 hundredths is that will cancel out, it'll take away these 38 hundredths. And then I still have to subtract a little bit more. If I also subtracted 38 hundredths, I have to subtract a total of 54 hundredths. Let's see, 54 is how much more than 38? I am doing this in my head as I speak."
Math,"To go from 38 to 48, I need six, I need 10 more. I need to subtract another 16 hundredths. How did I think about that? 54 is 38 and 16. If I'm subtracting 54, I could break that up. I could subtract 38 hundredths, and then I could subtract 16 hundredths. Why did I pick 38 hundredths? Because it matches up with this. And so, if I say eight minus four is going to be four, and then I have 38 hundredths minus 38 hundredths, those are just gonna cancel out with each other."
Math,"So this minus that is just gonna be four. And then I'd say four minus 16 hundredths. So how do we think about that? Well, you might be able to do this in your head at this point. You might say: ""OK, I have to go 16 hundredths ""less than four, that's gonna be three and 84 hundredths."" Or, you might wanna just break it up. You could say: ""OK, four is the same thing as ""three plus 100 hundredths."" Hundredths. And then I wanna take away minus 16 hundredths. 100 minus 16 is 84."
Math,"This part right over here is 84 hundredths. I'll write it out. Hundredths. Which I can write as 0.84. Three plus 0.84, that's going to be, this is going to be equal to, we figured it out already multiple times, three and 84 hundredths. Now, as I said, there's multiple ways that we can try to tackle this. For example, another way that I could do this one right over here is I could say, all right, lemme do the ones. I'd say, eight minus four. Eight minus four. Let me try to do the tenths."
Math,"So, I could have three tenths minus five tenths. 0.3 minus 0.5. And then, I would have the hundredths. So, eight hundredths minus four hundredths. Plus eight hundredths minus four hundredths. Now, this is pretty easy to compute, this is pretty easy to compute, but what about this? I don't have five tenths to take away. What I could do is, instead of having an eight here, I could take one away from it, and make that a seven. And so, I have one that I can regroup someplace over here. I can reorganize it."
Math,"So, I could view this as seven plus 10 tenths. And so, I can take those 10 tenths, I could take those 10 tenths, and add 'em right over here. Lemme rewrite this. I could rewrite this as seven minus four, plus 10 tenths, plus three tenths. Actually, lemme just write it all as plus three tenths. I'm mixing different ways of writing it this way, but that might be good. Minus five tenths. And then this part I could just compute. This is plus four hundredths. Zero point zero. Color. Plus four hundredths."
Math,"This right here is gonna be four hundredths. Now what is this going to be? Seven minus four is going to be three. 10 tenths plus three tenths. The right color. This is going to be three. And then, 10 tenths plus three tenths is 13 tenths, minus five tenths is eight tenths, and then I have four hundredths. Once again, 3.84. Three ones, eight tenths, four hundredths. Or, three and 84 hundredths.."
Math,"So I could first think about six itself. Six is clearly divisible by six, but it's not perfectly divisible by four, so now, let's multiply by two, so then we get to 12. 12 is divisible by both six and four. So 12 is a good common denominator here. It's the least common multiple of six and four. So we can rewrite both of these fractions as something over 12. So, something over 12 plus something, plus something over 12 is equal to."
Math,"Now, there's a bunch of ways to tackle it, but what I want to do is I just want to visualize it here on this drawing. So, if I go, if I were to go from, if I were to go from six equal sections to 12 equal sections, which is what I'm doing if I'm going from six in the denominator to 12 in the denominator."
Math,"I'm essentially multiplying each of these sections by, or, I'm essentially multiplying the number of sections I have by two, or I'm taking each of these existing sections and I'm turning them into two sections, so let's do that. Let's do that. Let me see if I can do it pretty neatly, so, I can do it a little bit neater than that. So, it'll look like that. whoops. Let me do this one. I want to divide them fairly close to evenly. I'm doing it by eye so it's not going to be perfect. So, and you have that one."
Math,"And then last not, last but not least, you have that one there, and then notice, I had six sections, but now I've doubled the number of sections. I've turned the six sections into 12 sections by turning each of the original six into two, so now I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 sections. So if I have 12 sections now, how many of those 12 are now shaded in? Instead of having five of the six, I now have 10 of the 12 that are shaded in. So I now have 10/12."
Math,"5/6 is the same thing as 10/12. Another way you could have thought about that, to go from six to 12, I had to multiply by two, so then I have to do the same thing in the numerator. Five times two is 10. But hopefully you see that those two fractions are equivalent, that I didn't change how much is shaded in, I just took each of the original six and I turned it into two, or I multiplied the total number of sections by two to get 12, and then instead of having 5/6, I now have 10/12 shaded in."
Math,"Now let's do the same thing with the four, with the 1/4. Right here, I've depicted 1/4, but I want to turn this into something over 12. So to turn it into something over 12, each section has to be turned into three sections. So let's do that. Let's turn each section into three sections. So, that's one, two, and three. So then I have one, two, and three. I have, I think you can see where this is going. two and three. I have one, two, and three."
Math,"And so notice, all I did is I multiplied, before I had four equal sections. Now I turned each of those four sections into three sections, so now I have 12 equal sections. And I did that, essentially, by multiplying the number of sections I had by three. So now what fraction is shaded in? Well, now, this original that was one out of the four, we can now see is three out of the 12 equal sections."
Math,"It's now three out of the 12 equal sections, and so what is this going to be? Well, if I have 10/12, and I'm adding it to 3/12, well how many twelfths do I have? I'm going to have 13/12. And you could see it visually over here as well. Up here in green, I have 10/12 shaded in. Each of these boxes are a twelfth. Let me write that down. Each of these boxes are 1/12. That's 1/12. This is 1/12."
Math,"So how many twelfths do I have shaded in? I have the 10 that are shaded in in green, and then I have an 11/12, a 12/12 and then finally, the 13/12 is one way to think about it.."
Math,"All right, now let's work on this together. Now in the future, we will learn how to actually add something like 2/3 to 4/5, but for the sake of this exercise, we just want to get good at estimating it. And one way to estimate is to try to visualize. So let's make, so this is a whole right over here, and then this is another whole right over there. Try to make them the same size. Now what does 2/3 look like? Well, let me divide this into three equal sections, so that is pretty close."
Math,"It's hand drawn, so it's not perfect, but I think it gets the job done. And 2/3 would be, that's 1/3 right over there and then that is 2/3 right there, and what does 4/5 looks like? Well, let's see. I can divide this into fifths, so 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and then 4/5, and 5/5. That is pretty good. And now what does 4/5 look like? Well, it would be 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and then 4/5."
Math,"So if we were to add these two together, do we have less than 1/2 of a bag, more than 1/2 of a bag, but less than one bag, or more than one bag? Well, when you see even the first 2/3, where is a half? A half would have been right around there if we're talking about half of it. So 2/3 is more than a half, and then we also see that 4/5 is more than a half. If you had a half, it would have been like this far. So you can see that you're adding two things together that are both more than a half."
Math,"And if you have two halves of something, that'd be a whole, so if you have two things that are more than a half, if you add them together, you're gonna have more than a bag of chocolate chips. So I like this choice right over here. Let's do another example. So here, we are told that a banana weights 3/8 of a kilogram, an apple weighs 2/3 of a kilogram. Determine a reasonable estimate for the weight of both fruits. So pause this video again and see if you can have a go at that."
Math,"All right, so the key is that we need to determine a reasonable estimate. So let's actually just try to represent these again, so how could I represent 3/8 of something, of a kilogram, in this case? Well, let me draw a rectangle here and I'm going to try to divide it into eighths, eight equal sections, so that looks about a half. Let me do it right over there."
Math,"That looks like about a half, and then if I were to divide those, these would be fourths, and this is hand drawn, so it's not perfect, but it will help us understand things a bit. So then let me divide these, and so this would get me to eighths. So I have eight sections here."
Math,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and if I'm talking about three of those eight equal sections, I'd have 1/8, 2/8, and 3/8, so that is 3/8 right over there and what does 2/3 looks like? So I'll do that in purple, so if this is a whole, this is a whole like that. If I divide it into three equal sections, it's going to be something like that. I could draw it a little bit better, so something like that, and so two of those three equal sections, that's 1/3, and so that is 2/3."
Math,"Now what happens if I try to add these things together? Well one thing I could try to do to help visualize is I could take that piece there. The wholes are roughly the same length or I tried to draw them so that they are roughly the same length, and if I were to copy and paste that and move that over here, it looks like, if I were to estimate it, I'm getting pretty close to a whole kilogram here. So it's definitely not just about 1/3 of a kilogram."
Math,"1/3 of a kilogram would be just one of these three equal sections. We're way more than that, so we rule that out. About one kilogram, that's what we saw. When we, when we take the 2/3 and add to that, 3/8, where it looks like, and once again, we're estimating. We don't know exactly. It looks like we're a little bit over a kilogram, so I like this choice, and we're no where close to two kilograms. Two kilograms, we would be filling in another whole on top of this one right over here."
Math,So it's not that choice either..
Math,"And we'll see that in other videos. But first of all, let's just find the least common multiple. Let me write it out because sometimes LCD could meet other things. So least common denominator of these two things is going to be the same thing as the least common multiple of the two denominators over here. The least common multiple of 8 and 6. And a couple of ways to think about least common multiple-- you literally could just take the multiples of 8 and 6 and see what they're smallest common multiple is."
Math,"So let's do it that way first. So multiples of six are 6, 12, 18, 24 30. And I could keep going if we don't find any common multiples out of this group here with any of the multiples in eight. And the multiples of eight are 8, 16, 24, and it looks like we're done. And we could keep going obviously-- 32, so on and so forth. But I found a common multiple and this is their smallest common multiple. They have other common multiples-- 48 and 72, and we could keep adding more and more multiple."
Math,"But this is their smallest common multiple, their least common multiple. So it is 24. Another way that you could have found at least common multiple is you could have taken the prime factorization of six and you say, hey, that's 2, and 3. So the least common multiple has to have at least 1, 2, and 1, 3 in its prime factorization in order for it to be divisible by 6. And you could have said, what's the prime factorization of 8? It is 2 times 4 and 4 is 2 times 2."
Math,"So in order to be divisible by 8, you have to have at least three 2's in the prime factorization. So to be divisible by 6, you have to have a 2 times a 3. And then to be divisible by 8, you have to have at least three You have to have two times itself three times I should say. Well, we have one 2 and let's throw in a couple more. So then you have another 2 and then another 2. So this part right over here makes it divisible by 8. And this part right over here makes it divisible by 6."
Math,"If I take 2 times 2 times 2 times 3, that does give me 24. So our least common multiple of 8 and 6, which is also the least common denominator of these two fractions is going to be 24. So what we want to do is rewrite each of these fractions with 24 as the denominator. So I'll start with 2 over 8. And I want to write that as something over 24. Well, to get the denominator be 24, we have to multiply it by 3. 8 times 3 is 24."
Math,"And so if we don't want to change the value of the fraction, we have to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same thing. So let's multiply the numerator by 3 as well. 2 times 3 is 6. So 2/8 is the exact same thing as 6/24. To see that a little bit clearer, you say, look, if I have 2/8, and if I multiply this times 3 over 3, that gives me 6/24. And this are the same fraction because 3 over 3 is really just 1. It's one whole. So 2/8 is 6/24 let's do the same thing with 5/6."
Math,"So 5 over 6 is equal to something over 24. Let me do that in a different color. I'll do it in blue. Something over 24. To get the denominator from 6 to 24, we have to multiply it by 4. So if we don't want to change the value of 5/6, we have to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same thing. So let's multiply the numerator times 4. 5 times 4 is 20. 5/6 is the same thing as 20/24. So we're done. We've written 2/8 as 6/24 and we've written 5/6 as 20/24."
Math,"If we wanted to add them now, we could literally just add 6/24 to 20/24. And I'll leave you there because they didn't ask us to actually do that.."
Math,"We have to pick a multiple of four and six, a multiple, some number that we can multiply four and get this number as an answer. So for example, for four, some multiples of four would be four times one is four, four times two is eight, four times three is 12, and so on. Those are multiples of four. And let's just pause here and look at why we have to pick a multiple of four and six, why we can't just pick any number but we have to pick a multiple of our denominators."
Math,"So the fraction we were just talking about was 1/4. We could look at either one, but let's look at 1/4. Here we have a picture showing fourths. And to show 1/4, we shade one of these four equal-size pieces. Maybe I wanna change this and I wanna say, ""I want two, I want two as my numerator."" So to have a numerator of two, I'm gonna need to split this fourth up here into two pieces. Now I have two shaded pieces."
Math,"So can I say this is two, one, two, out of one, two, three, four, five pieces? It's not 2/5 because these are not equal-size pieces. So if I split this fourth right here in half, I need to split all of them in half. And what I'm doing is doubling the amount of pieces. So now this is two pieces, this is two, and this is two, because we need equal-size pieces. So now, this is one, two pieces out of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight equal-size pieces. So 2/8."
Math,"And you can see, eight is a multiple of four because we multiplied by two, and that's what we did. We multiplied each of our pieces by two. We also multiplied our numerator by two because that was also doubled. The amount of shaded pieces doubled when the entire amount of pieces doubled. Now, we don't have to do this just with two. We could do any multiple of four. For example, we can do one more here. If we, again, let's shade 1/4, one of the four pieces."
Math,"And maybe this time we wanna split it into three equal-size pieces. So to have a new numerator of three, and these should be equal-sized, here's a numerator of three. But we can't do our denominator yet because we don't have equal-size pieces. So to get equal-size pieces we'll need to split each of these fourths into three. So we are tripling the amount of pieces. So now we have three shaded pieces out of a total of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, out of 12."
Math,"And I could have figured that out without even counting because I knew that we tripled. This time we multiplied our original denominator times three, we tripled. And we also multiplied our numerator times three. So these are the multiples, eight, 12, and so on, and so those are the denominators we can pick, something that we can multiply our denominator by so we can multiply the entire amount of pieces."
Math,"And again, so this is super clear, 1/4 and 2/8 and 3/12, they all represent the same amount, whether we had 1/4, the original, here's 2/8, 3/12, they're all equivalent. They all represent the same amount. They're just different ways of writing the same number. Back to our original question, what denominators can we use for fourths and for sixths? We know we need to use multiples, so let's look at the multiples. For four, we've already gone through some of these."
Math,"The first multiple of four is four times one, which is four. Second multiple of four is eight. Four times two is eight, so we could split our fourths in half and get eighths. Or we could say four times three is 12, which we showed again where we split our fourths, each fourth into three equal pieces. Or we could do four times four which is 16. Four times five is 20, four times six is 24, and so on."
Math,"The reason I'm stopping at 24 is I've looked at my answer choices and I can see the largest possible answer is 24, so I don't need to write any larger multiples. There are many, many, many more multiples of four, but we don't need to list them all 'cause the largest number we're gonna have to consider is 24. Let's do the same for sixths. We could leave our sixths alone, six times one, and keep six pieces. Or we could double our sixths."
Math,"Six times two would be 12, if we doubled the pieces we would have 12 pieces. We could say six times three, which is 18, or six times four, we could divide each of our sixths into four pieces, and we'd have six times four which is 24 or 24ths. And so on, again, I'll stop at 24 since it's the largest number we need to consider. So down to our answer choices, what numbers could we use for the denominator? Could we use eight? Let's look at these lists."
Math,"Eight is a multiple of four, so we could definitely split fourths into eighths, but eight is not a multiple of six, so we can not split sixths into eighths. Eight will not work as a denominator for both fractions. How about 12? 12 we can see is a multiple of four, and we showed that, we drew that already. And 12 is a multiple of six, we could split our sixths into two equal pieces each and we would have 12ths. So 12 does work, 12 is a denominator, a common denominator for fourths and sixths."
Math,"18, 18 is here on the sixths. We could split sixths into 18 because 18 is a multiple of six, but it is not a multiple of four. So we can rule out 18, 18 is not a common denominator. And 24, you may remember, was the last number we wrote on both of them. So yes, 24 could be a denominator for fourths and sixths. So we could use either 12 or 24, and there's a lot more numbers we could use too as common denominators, but from these choices we could use 12 or 24 as a common denominator for fourths and sixths."
Math,"And just a note, lots of times people like to use the smallest one, the least common denominator, which in this case is 12. And it makes a lot of sense because it's easier to do computation with smaller numbers, but you don't absolutely have to use the smallest one. You could use 12ths or 24ths or lots of other options. But again, 12ths is probably the simplest one to work with just 'cause generally it's easier to work with smaller numbers."
Math,"But for this question, the common denominators we can use from these choices for fourths and sixths are 12 and 24.."
Math,"Here we can use this rectangle to represent a whole, one whole. To show three fifths of that whole, we're gonna need to divide it into fifths or five equal pieces. Lets do that. Try to make these as equal as possible. We have three pieces, and then finally, there we go. So, these should represent five equal pieces, or fifths. To show three fifths, we need to shade three of those five pieces. So, one, two, three of those five pieces should be shaded in to show three fifths."
Math,"We've decided we don't want fifths anymore. Now, we want tenths. We want a new denominator of 10. To change this fraction over here, to change this to be tenths, we need to split each of these fifths in half. We need to double the amount of pieces. We can do that here. Now, instead of fifths, or five equal size pieces, we have tenths. We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. We found a way to have tenths without changing the amount that's represented."
Math,"The same amount is still shaded, but now we have tenths. Our denominator doubled. We multiplied it be two, we have twice as many pieces. But look at what happened to our numerator, instead of three pieces, now we have one, two, three, four, five, six pieces. It also doubled. It also was multiplied by two, because if we double all of the pieces, well then the shaded ones will also double. Each of those pieces also split in two, so now there's twice as many shaded pieces."
Math,"So, three fifths can be rewritten as six tenths. Three fifths is equal to six tenths, and again, we didn't change the fraction. We didn't change how much was shaded. Three fifths and six tenths represented the same amount. We just changed the denominator and wrote it a different way. So, three fifths can be rewritten in tenths as six tenths. Now, for seven halves, we again want a denominator of 10."
Math,"So, we can draw it out, or we could try to use this pattern we just noticed up here to figure out how to make halves turn into tenths. To get from fifths to tenths we had to double, or multiply by two. To get from halves to tenths, we'd have to multiply each of our pieces times five. Each of our halves would be split into five pieces. So, we multiply two times five to get tenths. Like the pattern showed us up here, if the denominator is multiplied by a number, we multiply the numerator by the same number."
Math,"Those shaded pieces would also be split five times. We multiply our seven times five also. You should match the numerator and denominator are multiplied by the same number. Seven times five is 35. So 35 tenths is equal to seven halves. To change these two fractions to have a common denominator of 10, three fifths will become six tenths, and seven halves will become 35 tenths.."
Math,"And it might be helpful to visualize 1/2 and 1/3. So this is a visualization of 1/2 if you viewed this entire bar as whole, then we have shaded in half of it. And if you wanted to visualize 1/3 it looks like that. So you could view this as this half plus this gray third here, what is that going to be equal to? Now one of the difficult things is we know how to add if we have the same denominator."
Math,"So if we had a certain number of halves here and a certain number of halves here, well then we would know how many halves we have here. But here we're trying to add halves to thirds. So how do we do that? Well we try to set up a common denominator. Now, what do we mean by a common denominator? Well what if we could express this quantity and this quantity in terms of some other denominator."
Math,And a good way to think about it is is there a multiple of two and three and it's simplest when you use the least common multiple and the least common multiple of two and three is six. So can we express 1/2 in terms of sixths and can we express 1/3 in terms of sixths? So we can just start with one over two and I made this little fraction bar a little bit longer 'cause you'll see why in a second.
Math,"Well if I wanna express it in terms of sixths, to go from halves to sixths, I would have to multiply the denominator by three. But if I want to multiply the denominator by three and not change the value of the fraction, I have to multiply the numerator by three as well. And to see why that makes sense, think about this. So this, what we have in green, is exactly what we had before but now if I multiply it the numerator and the denominator by three, I've expressed it into sixths."
Math,"So notice, I have six times as many divisions of the whole bar. And the green part which you could view as the numerator, I now have three times as many. So these are now sixths. So I now have 3/6 instead of 1/2. So this is the same thing as three over six and I want to add that or if I want to add this to what? Well how do I express 1/3 in terms of sixths? Well the way that I could do that, it's one over three, I would want to take each of these thirds and make them into two sections."
Math,"So to go from thirds to sixths I'd multiply the denominator by two but I'd also be multiplying the numerator by two. And to see why that makes sense, notice this shaded in gray part is exactly what we have here but now we took each of these sections and we made them into two sections. So you multiply the numerator and the denominator by two. Instead of thirds, instead of three equal sections, we now have six equal sections. That's what the denominator times two did."
Math,"Instead of shading in just one of them, I now have shaded in two of them because that one thing that I shaded has now turned into two sections. And that's what multiplying the numerator by two does. And so this is the same thing as 3/6 plus this is going to be 2/6. And you can see it here. This is 1/6, 2/6, and now that everything is in terms of sixths, what is it going to be? Well it's going to be a certain number of sixths."
Math,"If I have three of something plus two of that something, well it's going to be five of that something. In this case, the something is sixths. So it's going to be 5/6. I have trouble saying that. And you can visualize it right over here. This is three of the sixths, one, two, three, plus two of the sixths, one, two, gets us to 5/6."
Math,"But you could also view it as this green part was the original half and this gray part was the original 1/3, but to be able to compute it, we expressed both of them in terms of sixths.."
Math,"And you'd be right and the way to actually move forward is to find a common denominator, to convert both of these fractions into fractions that have a common denominator. So how do you think about a common denominator? Well, a common denominator's gonna have to be a common multiple of these two denominators of 10 and six."
Math,"So what's a common multiple of 10 and six? And it's usually simplest to find the least common multiple, and a good way of doing that is start with the larger denominator here, 10, and say, okay is 10 divisible by six? No. Okay, now, is 20 divisible by six? No. Is 30 divisible by six? Yes. 30 is divisible by six. So I'm just going through the multiples of 10 and saying, ""Well what is the smallest multiple of 10 that is divisible by six?"" And that's going to be 30."
Math,"So I could rewrite both of these fractions as something over 30. So nine over 10. How would I write that as something over 30? Well I multiply the denominator, I'm multiplying the denominator by three. So I've just multiplied the denominator by three. So if I don't want to change the value of the fraction, I have to do the same thing to the numerator."
Math,"I have to multiply that by three as well because now I'm just multiplying the numerator by three and the denominator by three, and that doesn't change the value of the fraction. So nine times three is 27. So once again, 9/10 and 27/30 represent the same number. I've just written it now with a denominator of 30, and that's useful because I can also write 1/6 with a denominator of 30. Let's do that. So 1/6 is what over 30? I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it."
Math,"So what did we do go from six to 30? We had to multiply by five. So if we multiply the denominator by five, we have to multiply the numerator by five as well, so one times five, one times five is five. So 9/10 is the same thing as 27/30, and 1/6 is the same thing as 5/30. And now we can add, now we can add and it's fairly straightforward."
Math,"We have a certain number of 30ths, added to another number of 30ths, so 27/30 + 5/30, well that's going to be 27, that's going to be 27 plus five, plus five, plus 5/30, plus 5/30, which of course going to be equal to 32/30. 32 over 30, and if we want, we could try to reduce this fraction. We have a common factor of 32 and 30, they're both divisible by two. So if we divide the numerator and the denominator by two, numerator divided by two is 16, denominator divided by two is 15."
Math,"So, this is the same thing as 16/15, and if I wanted to write this as a mixed number, 15 goes into 16 one time with a remainder one. So this is the same thing as 1 1/15. Let's do another example. Let's say that we wanted to add, we wanted to add 1/2 to to 11/12, to 11 over 12. And I encourage you to pause the video and see if you could work this out. Well like we saw before, we wanna find a common denominator."
Math,"If these had the same denominator, we could just add them immediately, but we wanna find a common denominator because right now they're not the same. Well what we wanna find is a multiple, a common multiple of two and 12, and ideally we'll find the lowest common multiple of two and 12, and just like we did before, let's start with the larger of the two numbers, 12. Now we could just say well 12 times one is 12, so that we could view that as the lowest multiple of 12."
Math,"And is that divisible by two? Yeah, sure. 12 is divisible by two. So 12 is actually the least common multiple of two and 12, so we could write both of these fractions as something over 12. So 1/2 is what over 12? Well to go from two to 12, you multiply by six, so we'll also multiply the numerator by six. Now we see 1/2, and 6/12, these are the same thing. One is half of two, six is half of 12."
Math,"And how would we write 11/12 as something over 12? Well it's already written as something over 12, 11/12 already has 12 in the denominator, so we don't have to change that. 11/12, and now we're ready to add. So this is going to be equal to six, this is going to be equal to six plus 11, six plus 11 over 12. Over 12. We have 6/12 plus 11/12, it's gonna be six plus 11 over 12, which is equal to, six plus 11 is 17/12."
Math,"If we wanted to write it as a mixed number, that is what, 12 goes into 17 one time with a remainder of five, so 1 5/12. Let's do one more of these. This is strangely fun. Alright. Let's say that we wanted to add, We're gonna add 3/4 to, we're gonna add 3/4 to 1/5. To one over five. What is this going to be? And once again, pause the video and see if you could work it out."
Math,"Well we have different denominators here, and we wanna find, we wanna rewrite these so they have the same denominators, so we have to find a common multiple, ideally the least common multiple. So what's the least common multiple of four and five? Well let's start with the larger number, and let's look at its multiples and keep increasing them until we get one that's divisible by four. So five is not divisible by four. 10 is not divisible by four, or perfectly divisible by four is what we care about."
Math,"15 is not perfectly divisible by four. 20 is divisible by four, in fact, that is five times four. That is 20. So what we could do is, we could write both of these fractions as having 20 in the denominator, or 20 as the denominator. So we could write 3/4 is something over 20. So to go from four to 20 in the denominator, we multiplied by five. So we also do that to the numerator. We multiply by three times five to get 15. All I did to go from four to 20, multiplied by five."
Math,"So I have to do the same thing to the numerator, three times five is 15. 3/4 is the same thing as 15/20, and over here. 1/5. What is that over 20? Well to go from five to 20, you have to multiply by four. So we have to do the same thing to the numerator. I have to multiply this numerator times four to get 4/20. So now I've rewritten this instead of 3/4 plus 1/5, it's now written as 15/20 plus 4/20. And what is that going to be? Well that's going to be 15 plus four is 19/20. 19/20, and we're done.."
Math,"And then from that, we're trying to subtract a third and we can visualize a third this way. That if this whole thing is a whole, I divide it into three equal sections and one of those three equal sections is a third. So what we wanna do is take away this gray box from this green box and figure out how we can mathematically say what is left over. So pause this video and see if you can have a go at this."
Math,"And I'll give you a hint, it will be useful to be able to represent your halves and thirds in terms of a different denominator. All right, now let's work through this together. So the way that we can approach this is to get a common denominator. If I can express both fractions in terms of the same denominator, it's going to be a lot easier to subtract. And the common denominator that's most useful is to find the least common denominator."
Math,"And the smallest number that is both a multiple of two and three is actually two times three, or six. So what if we were to write each of these numbers in terms of sixths. So how can we rewrite one half in terms of sixths? I always have trouble saying that. Well if I start with one half and if I multiply the denominator by three, that's going to get us to sixths and so I don't change the value of the fraction. I need to multiply the numerator by three as well."
Math,"As long as I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same thing. Well, then that's still going to be equal to one half and you can visualize what that looks like. If you take each of these two equal sections and turn them into three equal sections, well then you're gonna have a total of six equal sections or sixths. Two times three in the denominator and the part that was shaded in in green which was just one of those sections is now three times as many sections."
Math,"So your one half is now equal to three over six. And we can do the same thing over here. If we start with one third how do we express it in terms of sixths? Well to go from three to six I would multiply it by two, and so I also wanna do that in the numerator so that I don't change the value of the fraction and we can visualize that. Notice, if you take all three sections and you turn each of them into two sections you now have six equal sections."
Math,"So you are now dealing with sixths, and that one section before is now going to become two sections. So this is now going to be equal to two sixths. So we can actually rewrite things as this is the same thing as three sixths minus, minus two sixths. And what do you think that is going to be? Well if I have three of something and I subtract two of them away I'm going to be left with one of that something. So I'm going to be left with one sixth in this case."
Math,And we can visualize it just the way we visualized everything else. If you take two of these gray bars or two of these sections from these three sections you're just going to be left with one of them. This is one of the six equal sections..
Math,"And how do we figure out what that same denominator is? Well, it's going to be a common multiple of three and five, and, ideally, it's going to be the least common multiple of three and five. So, how can we calculate that? Well, we can start with the larger of the two numbers, say five, and let's go through it's multiples and see when we get to one that's divisible perfectly by three. So, five is not divisible by three, 10 is not divisible by three, 15 is divisible by three."
Math,"In fact, 15 is three times five. So, I can rewrite both of these fractions as something over 15. So, what's 4/3 if I were to rewrite it as something over 15? Well, to get from three to 15 in the denominator, we have to multiply by five. So, if you multiply the denominator by five, if you don't want to change the value of the fraction, you have to multiply the numerator by five as well. So, you have to multiply the numerator by five as well, four times five is going to be 20."
Math,"So, 4/3 is the same thing as 20/15. Alright. Now, how would we rewrite 1/5 and something over 15? So, we're going to have 15 in the denominator. Well, to go from five to 15, we had to multiply by three. So, if we multiply the denominator by three, we have to multiply the numerator by three as well. So, times three. One times three is just three. So, 4/3 minus 1/5, we can rewrite that as 20/15 minus 3/15. Now, this becomes a lot more straight forward."
Math,"What is this going to be? Well, this is going to be a certain number of fifteenths. We have 20/15 and we're taking away three of those fifteenths. So, we are going to have, if you have 20 of something and you take away three of them, you're going to have 17 of those things. In this case, we're talking about fifteenths. So, this is going to be 17/15. And if we wanted to write it as a mixed number, we could say 15 goes into 17 one time with a remainder of two. So, it's one and 2/15. Let's do another example."
Math,"Let's see if we can figure out what 7/10 minus 5/8 is. Five over eight. And I encourage you to pause this video and see if you can calculate it yourself. Well, just like we saw before, we have different denominators but we need to rewrite them so they have a common denominator, that way, we can subtract. And so, what's a common multiple of 10 and eight and, ideally, the least common multiple. It doesn't have to be but it keeps things a little bit simpler."
Math,"Well, let's start with the larger of the two numbers and then keep finding in their multiples and find one that is perfectly divisible by the other one, by eight. So, ten isn't perfectly divisible by eight, 20 isn't, 30 isn't, 40 is. 40 is a multiple of 10 and it's a multiple of eight. In fact, it's the least common multiple of 10 and eight. So, we can rewrite both of these fractions as something over 40. So, that's going to be something over 40 minus something over 40."
Math,"Minus something over 40 is equal to something. So, 7/10 is what over 40? Well, to go from 10 to 40 in the denominator, we multiplied by four. So, we have to do the same thing in the numerator, multiply the numerator by four. Seven times four is 28. So, 7/10 is the same thing as 28/40. Now, let's do the same thing with the other fraction. To go from eight to 40 in the denominator, we had to multiply the denominator by five. Eight times five is 40."
Math,"So, if we multiply the denominator by five, we have to multiply the numerator by five as well. Five times five is 25. So, 7/10 minus 5/8 is the exact same things as 28/40 minus 25/40 and now this makes a lot of sense. It's going to be a certain number of fortieths. If I have 28/40 and I take away 25 of those fortieths, how many fortieths am I going to have left? Well, I'm going to 3/40 left. 28/40 minus 25/40. So, I'm going to have 3/40. 28 minus 25 is three and we are done. 7/10 minus 5/8 is 3/40.."
Math,"So the first thing that might jump out at you is look, I have these fractions that I'm adding and subtracting, but they all have different denominators. So in order to add and subtract them in a reasonable way, we'd want to rewrite them so they all have the same denominator. So what we really want to do is find a common multiple of four, five and 10."
Math,"And like I always say, we can use any common multiple, but we simplify things a little bit if we use the smallest common multiple, or the least common multiple. And one way to find the least common multiple is take the largest of these numbers and look at their multiples and keep increasing the multiples until you find one that is divisible by the other two. So for example, I could start at 10. 10 is divisible by five but is not divisible by four. So then we can go 20."
Math,"20 is divisible by both five and four, so the least common multiple of four, five and 10 is 20. So let's rewrite all of these fractions as something over 20. So let's start with 1/4. 1/4 is what over 20? Well, to go from four to 20, you have to multiply by five, so you have to do the same thing to the numerator. You have to multiply it by five. One times five is five. One over four is the same thing as 5/20. Four is four times one, 20 is four times five."
Math,"Then we want to think about, well, what happens to 3/5 If I write it as something over 20? Well to go in the denominator from five to 20, you have to multiply it by four, so you have to multiply the numerator by four as well. So three times four is going to be equal to 12."
Math,"And then we're going to subtract 3/10, but how do we write that as something over 20? Well, to go from 10 to 20, you multiply the denominator by two, so if we want to have the same fraction, we need to multiply the numerator by two as well. So three times two is six. So what is this going to be equal to? Well now I have 5/20 plus 12/20 minus 6/20. So what is this going to be? Well, there's a bunch of ways you could think about it."
Math,"You could say, well, this is just going to be, this is going to be 5/20 plus 12/20 plus 12/20 minus 6/20, minus 6/20. Or another way of thinking about it, the way I just wrote it here, five plus 12 minus six, all of that, over 20. This is how many 20ths are going to result. So what is that equal to? Well that's going to be equal to all of this, we are counting 20ths, is one way to think about it. So five plus 12 is 17 minus six is 11. So we get 11/20."
Math,"I have 5/20, I add 12/20 and I take away 6/20, I'm going to be left with 11/20. Let's do one more example of this, just for good practice. So here I have 4/9 minus 1/6 plus 1/3. And like before, I encourage you to puase the video and see if you can work this out. Well, what I want to do is I want to rewrite all of these fractions so that they have a common denominator. And to find a common denominator, you need to find a common multiple of nine, six and three."
Math,"And like I did before, what I could do is I could start with a nine and say okay, nine, it's not divisible by six. It is divisible by three, but that's not good enough. I want to find the common multiple of nine, six and three, and as small as one as possible. So let's look at the next multiple of nine, we get to 18. And 18 is divisible by nine of course, six and three. So let's go with 18. Let's write everything as something over 18."
Math,"So 4/9 is what over 18? Well, nine times two is 18, that's what I did to the denominator, so I have to multiply the numerator by two as well. So this is going to be 8/18. Well, what's 1/6 over 18? Well, to go from six to 18 in the denominator, I have to multiply it by three, so I have to multiply the numerator by three as well. So one times three is three. And then last but not least, what is 1/3 as something over 18? Well, three times six is 18, so one times six is going to be six."
Math,"Or you could do it another way, you could say, well, what's 1/3 of 18? It's going to be six. What's 1/6 of 18? It's going to be three. 4/9 of 18? That's a little bit harder to think in your brain but that's going to be 8/18. Either way, I've just rewritten these fractions, and I've rewritten them in the corresponding color. So this up here is the exact same thing as 8/18 minus 3/18 plus 6/18."
Math,"So what is this going to be equal to? It's going to be a certain number of 18ths, and so if I have 8/18 minus 3/18, that's going to be 5/18, plus 6/18 is going to be 11/18. And we are done.."
Math,"Now, let's work through this together. One thing that might make it a little bit simpler for our brains is if we were to express one-16th and three-halves with a common denominator. When we think about a common denominator, we will look at a common multiple of the denominators here. And lucky for us, 16 is already divisible by 2. It's divisible by 16 as well, so it is the common multiple, or it is the least common multiple of 16 and 2."
Math,"There are other common multiples, but the smallest one is going to be 16 times 1, which is also divisible by 2. So, let's try both of these, let's try both of these fractions. Let's rewrite this equation where both of these fractions have 16 as their denominators. This one obviously already has it. So, let's write that. So, we're going to have, we're going to have blank plus one-16th, one-16th, is equal to, is equal to, let's see, let's write three-halves as something over 16."
Math,"Well, to get our denominator from 2 to 16, we have to multiply by 8. So, we have to multiply the numerator by 8 as well. So, 3 times 8 is going to be 24. Now, at this point, you might be able to do it in your head. Blank plus one-16th is equal to 24-16ths. We could say, okay, this could, this could... We could do this as a certain number of 16ths. So, how many 16ths plus one-16th is going to be 24-16ths? Well, 23-16ths. That's 23-16ths, and I add one more 16th, I'm going to have 24-16ths."
Math,"Another way that you could have thought about it, when we... Actually, you could have even thought about it from the first step, is you could say, look, if blank plus one-16th is equal to three-halves, then you could say that blank, you could say that blank is going to be equal to three-halves, three-halves minus one-16th, minus one-16th. This is another way that you could have tackled it. If blank plus one-16th is three-halves, then blank is going to be equal to three-halves minus one-16th."
Math,"And we know that this is going to be equal to... Three-halves, we already know, it's the same thing as 24-16ths. So, 24 over 16 minus one-16th, minus one-16th, which we figured out is 23/16ths, which is equal to... I'll just rewrite it again, 23 over 16. Let's do another example. So, here, this is a little bit different. I have blank minus three-fourths is equal to two-thirds. And there's a couple of ways to think about it."
Math,"If blank minus three-fourths is equal to two-thirds, that, one way to think about it, you can say, blank, that means that blank is going to be the same thing as two-thirds plus three-fourths. Two-thirds plus three-fourths. Plus three-fourths. And what is this going to be? Well, once again, I could rewrite both of these fractions so they have a common denominator."
Math,"Well, what's the least common multiple of 3 and 4? Well, we could look at the multiples of 4 and keep, and, and keep increasing them until we find one that's perfectly divisible by 3. 4 isn't divisible by 3. 8 isn't divisible by 3. 12 is divisible by 3. In fact, it's 3 times 4 is 12. So, we can rewrite both of these as something over 12. So, this is going to be the same thing as... So, to go from 3 to 12, we multiply it by 4. So, you have to multiply the numerator by 4 as well. So, 2 times 4 is 8."
Math,"Two-thirds is the same thing as eight-12ths. This is going to be equal to eight-12ths plus, and then three-fourths is the same thing as what over 12? Well, to go from 4 to 12, you have to multiply it by 3, so you have to multiply the numerator by 3 as well. 3 times 3 is 9. And what's that going to be equal to? So, it's equal to this, which is equal to eight-12ths plus nine-12ths is going to be, 8 plus 9 is 17. 17-12ths. So, you get 17-12ths minus three-fourths is equal to two-thirds."
Math,"Now, another way that you could have done it is you could have just kept it the same and could have said, okay, let me just rewrite, let me just rewrite this, but I'm going to rewrite the fractions so that they have a common denominator. We already said, well, our common denominator we want to use is 12, at least. We could use 24 or something larger than that. But this would have been the least common multiple, so this keeps things a little bit simpler."
Math,"And three-fourths, we're going to rewrite this as nine-12ths. 9 over 12 is equal to. And two-thirds, we can rewrite as 8 over 12. And you could assume that this is going to be a certain number of 12ths. So, blank-12ths minus nine-12ths is equal to eight-12ths. So, if I have blank of something minus nine of something, and I'm left with eight of that something, that means that I had 17 of that something to begin with. 17-12ths minus nine-12ths is equal to eight-12ths."
Math,"But either way, you get 17-12ths for our blank.."
Math,"And to that, we are going to add 18 and 2/3, which is the same thing as 18 plus 2/3. Now we can separately add the whole number parts. So we could add the 19 to the 18. So we could do 19 plus 18. And then we can add the fraction parts-- let me do this in green-- plus 3/18 plus 2/3. Now 19/18, pretty straightforward. That is what? Let's see. 19 plus 19 would be 38. So this is going to be 1 less than that. It's going to be 37. So that gives me 37."
Math,"And then 3/18 plus 2/3, to add them, I need to have the same denominator. And the least common multiple of 18 and 3 is 18. So let's convert 2/3 to something over 18. So 2/3, if I want to write it as something over 18, well, I multiplied the denominator by 6, so I'd also have to multiply the numerator by 6. So it's the same thing as 12/18. So I can rewrite 2/3 as 12/18. And now I can add these two things together."
Math,"That's going to be-- so I have 37 plus-- it's going to be something over 18-- plus something over 18. 3 plus 12 is 15, plus 15/18. And so expressing this as a mixed number, I get 37 and 15/18. And that's the right number. But we can simplify it even more. We can simplify the 15/18. Both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 3. So let's divide them both by 3. And we're not changing the value because we're doing the same thing to the numerator and the denominator."
Math,"And so this gives us, we still have our 37, but the numerator is now 5, and the denominator is now 6. So we get 37 and 5/6. And we're done.."
Math,"And the reason why I'm saying minus 3 minus 2/5 is this is the same thing as minus 3 plus 2/5. And so you distribute the negative sign. You're subtracting a 3, and then you're subtracting the 2/5. And so now we can worry about the whole number parts, 7 minus 3. Well, 7 minus 3 is going to give us 4. So that's going to give us 4. And then we're going to have 6/9 minus 2/5. So let me think about what 6/9 minus 2/5 are. 6/9 minus 2/5, well, we're going to have to find a common denominator."
Math,"So this is going to be the same thing. And I think the least common multiple of 9 and 5 is going to be 45. Literally, you then multiply. They have no common factors. So it's going to be over 45. To go from 9 to 45, I have to multiply by 5. So I'm going to have to multiply the numerator by 5. So 6 times 5 is 30. Then I'm going to subtract. To go from 5 to 45, I had to multiply by 9. So I have to multiply the numerator by 9 if I don't want to change the value. So 2 times 9 is 18."
Math,"And 30/45 minus 18/45 is going to be something over 45. 30 minus 18 is 12. If I subtract these two fractions right over here, I get 12/45. So it's 4 plus 12/45. Or if we wanted to write it as a mixed number, this is equal to 4 and 12/45. But we're not done yet. We can simplify this further. 12 and 45 have common factors. They're both divisible by 3. Actually, they're both divisible by-- well, I think we can divide more after that. So let's see."
Math,"If we divide the numerator by 3 and the denominator by 3, we end up with 4. And 12 divided by 3 is 4. And 45 divided by 3 is 15. 4 and 4/15. And actually, we're done. These two can't be simplified anymore. 4 and 4/15.."
Math,"So one way that you might see is to just rewrite this expression, so just rewrite 2 2/3 plus, plus 8 3/4. Plus 8 3/4 and you might be saying why whould I rewrite it this way? Well, when you rewrite it this way, it's very clear that these are the fraction parts of the mixed numbers and these are the whole number parts of the mixed numbers, and maybe we could add them separately, but before we even start adding the fraction parts of the mixed numbers, we notice that we have different denominators here."
Math,"We have a three and we have a four, so it would be nice to find a common denominator and we've seen multiple times in the past, when you're adding fractions with unlike denominators, a good common denominator would be their least common multiple, the least common multiple of three and four. Well, what's that going to be? Well, let's look at the multiples of four. Four is not perfectly divisible by three. Eight is not perfectly divisible by three."
Math,"12 is, in fact, 12 is four times three, so I can rewrite both of these fraction parts with 12 as their denominator. So this is going to be equal to, let me just write it this way. So I can rewrite it as two and something over 12. Now what would be that something over 12? To go from three to 12 in the denominator, we multiply it by four, so we have to multiply the numerator by four as well. So two times four is eight."
Math,"2/3 is the same thing as 8/12, so 2 2/3 is the same thing as 2 8/12, and then we can do the same thing down here. 8 3/4 is gonna be the same thing as eight and something over 12. Well, to go from four to 12 in the denominator, you multiply it by three, so we have to multiply the numerator by three as well. Three times three is nine, and now, we can add. We can add, and what do we get? Well, we have 8/12 plus 9/12. That's going to be 17, 17/12."
Math,"Well, you might recognize, 17/12, this is greater than or equal to one, so we can actually, this is an improper fraction right over here, so we can actually rewrite this, we can rewrite this as a mixed number. Let me make it clear. 17/12, so, do it right over here. 17/12 is the same thing as 1 5/12. How did I figure that out? 12 goes into 17 one time, and then I still 5 left over. 17/12 is the same thing as 1 5/12."
Math,"So what I could do is, I could write the 5/12 part in the fraction part of our, or I guess, say, the fraction place on our numbers, and then I could regroup the one, put it in the whole number column, and now I can just add the one plus two is three, plus eight is 11. So we get 11 5/12, 11 5/12. Now there is other ways that we could have tackled this."
Math,"What we could've done is gone from this place right over here, the 2 8/12, and the 8 9/12, and we could've converted these into improper fractions then added those improper fractions, so we could've said, and this is the same thing, let me rewrite it as, let's see, two is the same as 24/12 plus 8, is going to be 32/12, so I could rewrite this top mixed number as 32/12, clearly an improper fraction, and I could rewrite this bottom mixed number as, let's see, eight is how many 12s? That's going to be 96/12 plus another 9/12, is 105/12."
Math,"105/12. If what I just did looks a little bit confusing, you should review the Khan Academy videos on converting mixed numbers to improper fractions or vice versa, but now I could think about adding these two, and what, what would I get out? 32/12 plus 105/12, which would be, what, 137/12, and then if we wanted to rewrite this as a mixed number, we could say, OK let's see, 12 will go to 137, 11 times, so it goes 11 times. 11 times 12 is 132, so you would have five left over, so it's 11 5/12."
Math,"So you could've done it either way. I think this one, the way we did it the first time would've been a little bit easier because you didn't have to deal with these really big numbers like 137 and 105 and 32, and you just dealt with more straightforward numbers. Say, hey look, 8/12 plus 9/12 is 17/12, which is the the same thing as 1 5/12, and then you had 1 5/12 plus two plus eight, is gonna give you 11 5/12.."
Math,"So what I'm going to do is I'm going to rewrite these mixed numbers. So I'm going to write this as 17 and 4/9 minus 12 and 2/3. I'm going to write the 12 right under the 17, and I'm going to write the 2/3 right under the 4/9. Let me make it very clear, we are subtracting 12 and 2/3 from 17 and 4/9. So the first thing that we might want to do is we could look at the fraction parts and we might want to start subtracting until we see, look, we have different denominators here."
Math,"We have ninths and we have thirds. So the first thing we'd want to do is let's get to a common denominator, and a good common denominator would be the least common multiple of nine and three. Well, what's that going to be? Well to think about that, I like to start with a larger number, nine. And say, well, is that divisible by three? Well, yes, it is divisible by three. It is divisible by the other denominator, so this actually is the least common multiple."
Math,"If it wasn't, I would keep taking higher and higher multiples of 9. I would go to 18 and then I would go to 27, and I would keep going until I found one that's divisible by three. But I didn't have to do that because nine is divisible by three. So I can rewrite both of these fraction parts in terms of ninths. Now the one on top already is written in terms of ninths, so I can just rewrite that. 17 and 4/9. And the one on the bottom, I can write as 12 and some number of ninths."
Math,"So 2/3 is how many ninths? Well, to go from thirds to ninths I had to multiply by three, had to multiply by three, so the numerator, I need to multiply by three as well. Two times three is six. 2/3 is the same thing as 6/9. And now I can try to subtract. But even here, when I try to subtract, I have a larger fraction down here that I'm trying to subtract from a smaller one. I have 4/9 minus 6/9. So what can I do? Well, be answer is I can regroup. I can take a whole from the 17. Let me do that."
Math,"So if I take a whole from the 17, that's going to become 16, and then that whole that I just took from, I guess you could say the whole number place, I can add it to the fraction. Well, a whole is just going to be 9/9. So all I did was I regrouped here. I took 9/9 from 17. 9/9 is one, so I took 9/9 from 17, I'm left with 16, and then I regrouped them and I added them to the fractions place, as one way to think about it. Well, what's 4/9 plus 9/9? Well, that's going to be 13/9."
Math,"So this right over here is 13/9. It's a very strange way to write it, but 17 and 4/9 is the same thing as 16 and 13/9, because notice, this is greater than one. This is the same thing as one and 4/9. One and 4/9 plus 16 is going to be 17 and 4/9. Now why did I do all of this? Well 13/9 is larger than 6/9, so I can subtract. What's 13/9 minus 6/9 going to be? Well, 13 of something, in this case, ninths, minus six of that same something is going to be 7/9. Seven, let me write that in a neutral color."
Math,"So that's going to be 7/9. 13/9 minus 6/9 is 7/9. And then I can look over in the whole number place. All I have left a 16 here. 16 minus 12 is four, and I'm done. 17 and 4/9 minus 12 and 2/3 is equal to four and 7/9.."
Math,"If they mix their paints together, will they have the 1 gallon they need? So let's think about that. We're going to add the 2/5 of a gallon of red paint, and we're going to add that to 1/2 a gallon of yellow paint. And we want to see if this gets to being 1 whole gallon. So whenever we add fractions, right over here we're not adding the same thing. Here we're adding 2/5. Here we're adding 1/2. So in order to be able to add these two things, we need to get to a common denominator."
Math,"And the common denominator, or the best common denominator to use, is the number that is the smallest multiple of both 5 and 2. And since 5 and 2 are both prime numbers, the smallest number's just going to be their product. 10 is the smallest number that we can think of that is divisible by both 5 and 2. So let's rewrite each of these fractions with 10 as the denominator. So 2/5 is going to be something over 10, and 1/2 is going to be something over 10. And to help us visualize this, let me draw a grid."
Math,"Let me draw a grid with tenths in it. So, that's that, and that's that right over here. So each of these are in tenths. These are 10 equal segments this bar is divided into. So let's try to visualize what 2/5 looks like on this bar. Well, right now it's divided into tenths. If we were to divide this bar into fifths, then we're going to have-- actually, let me do it in that same color. So it's going to be, this is 1 division, 2, 3, 4."
Math,"So notice if you go between the red marks, these are each a fifth of the bar. And we have two of them, so we're going to go 1 and 2. This right over here, this part of the bar, represents 2/5 of it. Now let's do the same thing for 1/2. So let's divide this bar exactly in half. So, let me do that. I'm going to divide it exactly in half. And 1/2 literally represents 1 of the 2 equal sections. So this is one 1/2."
Math,"Now, to go from fifths to tenths, you're essentially taking each of the equal sections and you're multiplying by 2. You had 5 equals sections. You split each of those into 2, so you have twice as many. You now have 10 equal sections. So those 2 sections that were shaded in, well, you are going to multiply by 2 the same way. Those 2 are going to turn into 4/10. And you see it right over here when we shaded it initially. If you Look at the tenths, you have 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, and 4/10."
Math,"Let's do the same logic over here. If you have 2 halves and you want to make them into 10 tenths, you have to take each of the halves and split them into 5 sections. You're going to have 5 times as many sections. So to go from 2 to 10, we multiply by 5. So, similarly, that one shaded-in section in yellow, that 1/2 is going to turn into 5/10. So we're going to multiply by 5. Another way to think about it. Whatever we did to the denominator, we had to do the numerator."
Math,"Otherwise, somehow we're changing the value of the fraction. So, 1 times 5 is going to get you to 5. And you see that over here when we shaded it in, that 1/2, if you look at the tenths, is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 tenths. And now we are ready to add. Now we are ready to add these two things. 4/10 plus 5/10, well, this is going to be equal to a certain number of tenths. It's going to be equal to a certain number of tenths. It's going to be equal to 4 plus 5 tenths. And we can once again visualize that."
Math,"Let me draw our grid again. So 4 plus 5/10, I'll do it actually on top of the paint can right over here. So let me color in 4/10. So 1, 2, 3, 4. And then let me color in the 5/10. And notice that was exactly the 4/10 here, which is exactly the 2/5. Let me color in the 5/10-- 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. And so how many total tenths do we have? We have a total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 9 of the tenths are now shaded in. We had 9/10 of a gallon of paint."
Math,"So now to answer their question, will they have the gallon they need? No, they have less than a whole. A gallon would be 10 tenths. They only have 9 tenths. So no, they do not have enough of a gallon. Now, another way you could have thought about this, you could have said, hey, look, 2/5 is less than 1/2, and you could even visualize that right over here. So if I have something less than 1/2 plus 1/2, I'm not going to get a whole."
Math,"So either way you could think about it, but this way at least we can think it through with actually adding the fractions.."
Math,"And they ask us, what is the difference between the heights of the beefsteak, so that's that one right over there, and the Roma tomato plants? So they want us to find the distance between these two heights. So this cherry tomato height was really unnecessary for the sake of this problem. So we want to find the difference in these two heights. So we want to subtract the smaller of these from the larger of these. So we're really trying to evaluate what 3 and 1/4 minus 2 and 7/8 is."
Math,"Now, the first thing that I like to do is convert both of these into mixed numbers. Sorry, they're already mixed numbers-- to convert both of these into improper fractions. So 3 and 1/4 is the same thing as 3 plus 1/4, which is the same thing as 12/4 plus 1/4. That's the same thing as 3 and 1/4. And from that, we're going to subtract 2 and 7/8. 2 and 7/8 is the same thing as 2 plus 7/8. 2 is the same thing as 16/8 plus 7/8. So this is essentially what we are trying to figure out."
Math,"Now, what is 12/4 plus 1/4? It's 13/4, 13 over 4. And then, what's 16/8 plus 7/8? Well, that's 23/8. So this is going to be minus 23 over eight. Now, we're subtracting one fraction from another. But we have different denominators. So we can't make sense of this until we have the same denominator. And so what is the least common multiple of these two denominators, of both 4 and 8? What is the smallest number that is divisible by both 4 and 8? Well, 8 is divisible by 8. And 8 is also divisible by 4."
Math,"So if we can rewrite 13/4 as having 8 as a denominator, then we are all set. So let's try to do that. So we're going to write both of these with 8 as the denominator. This one already has it. So 13/4, I'm going to have it with 8 as the denominator. So to get from 4 to 8, we have to multiply the denominator So in order to not change the value of the fraction, we have to multiply the numerator by that exact same value. We've got to multiply it by 2. So this becomes 26/8."
Math,"And from 26/8, we're going to subtract 23/8. And so this is going to be over 8-- 26 minus 23, which is equal to, and we deserve our drum roll now, is 3. So it's 3/8. So the difference between the heights of the beefsteak and Roma tomato plants-- 3/8. And everything we've been doing insofar has been in feet, so 3/8 of a foot.."
Math,"Now like always, I encourage you to pause this video and see if you could work this out on your own. Now let's work this through together, and I'm going to work it out in a way that at least my head likes to tackle it. Once you get enough practice, you might even be able to do these types of multiplication problems without even needing to use paper. So the key realization here is to say, well look, this is eight 100s. So that's the same thing as eight times 100. And this over here is four 100s."
Math,"So this is four times 100. And so it's eight times 100, times four times 100. And if you're multiplying a bunch of numbers like this, you can switch the order in which you're doing the multiplication. So you can view this as eight times four. Eight times four, times 100 times 100. Times 100 times 100. Times 100. Now why is this easier? Well what is eight times four going to be? Well eight times four, if we know our times tables, is 32."
Math,"And so it's going to be 32 times, what's 100 times 100 going to be? Now there's multiple ways that you can think about this, and I want you to really think it through, but we'll soon see that there's a fairly fast way of making sure we got it right. But one way to think about it is, well let me do it over here. 10 times 100 is equal to 1,000. And so 100 times 100 is going to be 10 times that, or it's going to be equal to 10,000. So this stuff right over here is equal to 10,000."
Math,"Now you might notice something interesting here. I have two zeroes, and then another two zeroes. So I have a total of four zeroes. And then I have four zeroes here. Because every time you multiply by 10 you're gonna add another zero. So if you're multiplying by 100 you're gonna add two zeroes. If you're multiplying by 1,000, you're gonna add three zeroes, and you see that here. So you have 32 times 10,000, which is going to be what? Well let's see. 32 times 1,000 would be 32,000."
Math,"But this is 32 times 10,000. So it's going to be 320,000. Now you might already notice an interesting pattern here. 32 times one followed by four zeroes is 32 followed by four zeroes. This is 32 10,000s, which is 320,000. Now another was you could've thought about it is eight times four gives us our 32. And then we have two zeroes there, two zeroes there for a total of four zeroes, and we have our four zeroes right over there. Now I don't want you to just memorize that."
Math,"It works because this is eight 100s times four 100s. Eight times four gives us the 32. And then the 100 times the 100s, that's where these four zeroes come from. Let's do another example. So let's do, let me delete this. And let us do, let me get my pen back. So let's do 30 times 70, or let's do 30 times 700. Pause the video and see if you can figure this out. So we can do it like we did before, 30 is three times 10. 700, so times 700, which is seven times 100."
Math,"And so if you say three times seven, is going to be 21 times 10 times 100, is going to be 1,000. So what's 21 times 1,000? Well that's going to be 21,000. Now just like we saw before, once you get a hang of it, and I always want you to understand where it's coming from, three times seven is the 21, and then you're gonna multiply that times 10 and then 100. So you have one, two, three zeroes. One, two, three zeroes. Let's do one more of these. So let's say we wanted to multiply 2,000 times 8,000."
Math,"Pause the video and see if you can figure out what this is. Maybe in your head. Try to do this one in your head. Or on paper, don't feel bad if you need to use paper. That's always prudent. Well you might get the hang of it now. You might be able to do this quite quickly. You might be able to say hey, two times eight, well that's going to be equal to 16. And then I have three plus three zeroes, so that's gonna be six zeroes. One, two, three, four, five, six, which gives me 16 million."
Math,"You would absolutely be correct. Now I want to reinforce what you're doing when you're just counting zeroes like that. What you're doing, you're just saying hey, this is the same thing as two times 1,000, times eight times 1,000. Eight times 1,000. And then you're just changing the order of multiplication. You're saying hey, let me multiply the two and the eight. You multiply the two times the eight, and you get 16. And then you multiply the times 1,000 times 1,000. So times 1,000 times 1,000."
Math,"And 1,000 1,000s, that's one million. This is one million right over here. And notice you see it there too. 1,000 times 1,000, you have three zeroes, three zeroes, you get six zeroes. 1,000 1,000s is a million. 16 times a million is 16 million. So hopefully that helps and makes you a little more comfortable multiplying these numbers that are multiples of ten, hundred, thousands, even millions.."
Math,"See if you can estimate what this is going to be. Well, before even looking at these answers, I would say this is going to be approximately equal to ... Let's see, 29 is awfully close to 30, and then I could multiply that times, I could either multiply that times 32 hundred, which is awfully close to 3,198, or if I wanted an even more rough approximation, I could say that's roughly equal to 30 times three thousand."
Math,"So if I did 30 times three thousand, three times three is equal to nine, and then I have one, two, three, four zeroes. One, two, three, four zeroes. And actually my approximation, it turns out, is here, right over here, 90 thousand. Now if I wanted a slightly better approximation, I could have said this is approximately equal to 30 times 3,200, and this you could also do in your head. You could say, well, what is three times 32? Well, that is gonna be 96, and then you have one, two, three zeroes."
Math,"One, two, three zeroes, so this would be a slightly better approximation, and if this is what you got, the closest answer here is still going to be equal to 90 thousand. Let's do another example. So here, we are asked to estimate 137 times 18. So pause this video again and see if you can come up with an estimate. Try to do it in your head. Well, there's once again many ways of trying to tackle it."
Math,"The way I would tackle it, I would say, well, that's pretty close to 140 times 20, and then this would be equal to 14 times two is 28, and then we have two zeroes here, so that would be roughly 28 hundred, but when I look over here, there is no 28 hundred, and so maybe the closest one right over here is two thousand, so that would be my, that could be an approximation."
Math,"Another way, it looks actually the way that they did it, they even did a coarser approximation, they rounded this to the nearest hundred, and so they said this is approximately equal to one hundred times and they rounded this to the nearest ten, one hundred times 20 which is even easier to do in your head, which is equal to two thousand, which is this choice that they got right over here.."
Math,"You add these three numbers together, you're going to have 352. And same idea, 481 that's four hundreds, four hundreds, plus eight tens, which is 80, so plus 80, and then we have one one, so plus one. And you might have be familiar with multiplying like this in the past, setting up this grid. And it's essentially we're applying the distributive property. We're gonna take the two and multiply it times 400 plus 80 plus one."
Math,"So we're gonna multiply two times each of those numbers, and actually I'm gonna just draw some quick lines here. So we have that, and then we'll have let me do it like this, then we have this, and then let me set up my grid. I'm having trouble drawing straight lines, okay there we go. Then one more in this direction. There you go. And then in this direction, let me draw some horizontal lines to have a neat clean grid here. There we go. Now first we'll multiply two times 400 plus 80 plus one."
Math,"So two times 400 is 800. Two times, let me do it in that same blue color, so this is 800. Two times 80 is 160, and then two times one is two. And then we can multiply 50 times these. So what's 50 times 400? Well five times four is 20, and then we have another one, two, three zeros. So one, two, three, so that's 20,000. 50 times 80, five times eight is 40, and then we have two zeros, just like that. And then we have 50 times one which is of course going to be equal to 50."
Math,"And then we go to the 300, which we will distribute and multiply times each of these, each of these numbers. 300 times 400, three times four is 12, and then we have four zeros. One, two, three, four. We get 120,000. 300 times 80, three times eight is 24, and then we have one, two, three zeros. One, two, three, so we get 24,000. And then 300 times one is of course equal to 300. And then what we wanna do is add up all of these numbers. So let's actually add up the rows first."
Math,"So if we add up the rows, let me draw another line going straight down like that. And so if we sum this up, this is going to be 962. 800 plus 160 is 960 plus two, so this is 962. This right over here is 24,050. 24,050. And then this right over here is what 100 and, 144,300? 144,300. 120,000 plus 24,000 is 144,000 plus 300, there you have it. And then you would add up these numbers just like that to get your final answer."
Math,"Now I'm gonna hold off doing that for a second as we see the other way of multiplying these numbers. So the other way of doing it, we could've said, 481, and this is sometimes called the standard algorithm, 481 times 300 and 50, let me do the same colors, And in the standard algorithm, the way that we do it is we start with this two in the ones place and then we multiply it times 481. So two times one is two, two times eight is 16."
Math,"So we put the six here and then we sometimes we will say we carry the one, but really regrouping that as hundreds. That's 10 tens which is hundreds. And then two times four is eight, which is really 800, plus one, so that's nine or really 900. You see a pattern here. This 962 is the exact same thing as that 962 right over there. Well because we multiplied the 200 times the one, times the 80, times the 400. We saw that over here, and then we just added 'em all together to be 962."
Math,"That's all the standard algorithm did just now. And then we move over to the five. But this is really five tens or 50, and that's why in the standard algorithm we put a zero here before saying all right what's five times one? It's five. What's five times eight? It is 40. We regroup the four. Let's delete this from before. What's five times four? Well that's 20 plus four is 24."
Math,"Notice 24,050, that's exactly what we had over here, and it makes sense because we're taking a 50 and we're multiplying it times 481 which is exactly what we did right over there. And so you might guess what's gonna happen when we take this three and we multiply it times 481. That's really a 300 times 481. Let me delete that so I don't get confused. So because it's a 300, in the standard algorithm, we put two zeros here first. And when I say algorithm it just means a method of doing something."
Math,"And so we'll say three times one is three. Three times eight is 24. And then three times four is 12 plus two is 14. And so notice, I have 144,300. And the standard way of doing it at this point we just add 'em all up. So whether we're doing it here or here, we just add everything up. So two plus zero plus zero is two. Six plus five is 11. Regroup that one. So one plus nine plus three is 13. And then one plus four plus four is nine. Two plus four is six."
Math,"Then we have a one right over there, so we get 169,312. And so when you just learn this method, the standard algorithm we some people might call it, it might seem like hey this just seems like a little bit of magic. But all you're doing is you're going to each of these places and you're distributing it, you're multiplying it times 400 plus 80 plus one to get this. Then you're multiplying 50 times 400 plus 80 plus one, and then 300 times 400 plus 80 plus one, exactly what we did right over here.."
Math,"And so the typical approach is you would write the larger multi digit number on top and then you would write the smaller single digit number below that, and since it's in the ones place, the seven, you would put it in the ones place column. So you'd put it right below the ones place in the larger number, so right below that two. And then you'd write the multiplication symbol. And the way you'd think about it is, all right, I'm just gonna take each of these places and multiply it by the seven."
Math,"So, for example, if I'm taking those two ones and I'm multiplying it times seven, well that's gonna be 14 ones. Well there's no digit for 14. I can only put four of those ones over here. And then the other 10 ones I can express as one 10, and so I'd put it up there. Sometimes when people learn it, they say, hey, two times seven is 14. I write the four and I carry the one. But all you're doing is you're saying, hey, 14 is one 10 plus four ones. But then you move over to the tens place."
Math,"You say, hey, what's nine tens times seven? Well, nine times seven is 63, so nine tens times seven is 63 tens, plus another 10 is 64 tens. You can only put four of those tens over here. So the other 60 tens you can express as six hundreds, so you can stick that right over there. Now a lot of people would explain that as saying, hey, nine times seven is 63, plus one is 64. Write the four and carry the six. But hopefully you understand what we mean by carrying. You're really trying to write 64 tens."
Math,"Only four of those tens can be expressed over here. Or that's maybe the cleanest way to do it. And then the other 60 tens you can express as six hundreds. And then, last but not least, five hundreds times seven is going to be 35 hundreds, and then you add six hundreds, you get 41 hundreds. So 41 hundreds, so it's 4,144. Now I wanna reconcile this, or connect it, to with other ways that you might have seen this. So let's say that, let's do this again. So if we were to write 592 times seven."
Math,"So one way that we've approached it in the past is we say, all right, what's two times seven? Well that's going to be 14. Notice that's the same 14. We're just representing it a little bit differently. Then we might say, well what is nine times seven? Gonna do the same color. And this really nine tens times seven. That's 63 tens, so you might write it right over there, which is the same thing as 630."
Math,"And then you could think about what is five hundreds times seven? Well that's 35 hundreds, so you could write it like that. Same thing as 3500, and then you would add everything up. So you have a total of four ones. You have a total of four tens. You have a total of 11 hundreds. You could right 100 there. And then regroup the other 10 hundreds into the thousands place as 1000. 1000 plus three thousands is 4000. So we got the exact same answer because we essentially did the same thing."
Math,"Over here, when we were carrying it, we were essentially regrouping things from here and you could think about it where we're condensing our writing versus what we did here. Here we just very systematically said two times seven, nine times seven, five times seven, but we made sure to keep track of the places to figure out what each of those, you could think of it as partial products, would be, and then we added."
Math,"While here we carried along the way, essentially regrouping the values when we said, hey, two ones times seven ones, that's 14 ones, which is the same thing as four ones plus one 10. And so on, and so forth. So I encourage you, one, it's good to learn this method. It's the most common way that folks multiply. Once again, your parents probably learned it this way, but it's really valuable to understand why these two things are the same thing, so really ponder that. Think about that."
Math,"And see if you can, if it all makes sense what's going on there. You're not just blindly memorizing the steps.."
Math,"All right, now let's just remind ourselves what the standard algorithm is. In fact, let's just remind ourselves what an algorithm is. An algorithm is a series of steps that you can do to do something, so you'll often hear about a computer algorithm. But you can also have algorithms in math, just a method for doing something. And the standard algorithm, that's the typical, or the standard, way that a lot of people will tackle a multiplication question or computation like this."
Math,"But just as a reminder, in the standard algorithm if we're multiplying 74 times 8 we would write the eight in the ones place right below the four in the ones place, and then you multiply each of these places times the eight. So you would start with the four times the eight, you would get 32. 32 you can express as two ones and three tens. So we'll put that three up there. And then you would multiple the seven times the eight."
Math,"Seven times eight is 56, and that's going to be 56 tens because it's seven 10s times eight is 56 tens. Plus the three 10s you had before get you to 59 tens, and so you would write over here. That's 59 tens, and so this would be 592. Now when you look at the choices, that's exactly what happened here in choice C. Just for kicks we can see what went wrong in these other ones."
Math,"Let's see, in this first one, when we multiplied the, when we multiplied the four ones times eight ones, according to this, this person somehow got three ones and two tens, and 23. Four times eight is not 23, you can rule that one out. And here when they multiplied the four ones times the eight ones, that would be the 32. So it's two ones and then another three tens, so there should've been a three up here."
Math,"And so that way when you multiplied the seven tens times eight, you get 56 but then you add this other three tens so you would really need to get to 59 tens. So that's why that one didn't work. Let's do another example here. And this is going to be with a different type of question. So here we are told that, Don starts to use the standard algorithm to solve 418 times five. His work is shown below. What number should Don replace Y with? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out."
Math,"Okay, so the way to think about this, this might at first confuse you a little bit, because Y, and why is there a Y there, in the first place? But what they're really trying to get at is making sure that you, or we, understand what Don is trying to do when he's trying to do the standard algorithms. So as we just highlighted in last example, the way that we would tackle this with the standard algorithm, and actually let me write it down, 418 times five."
Math,"We would say eight ones times five ones is going to be 40 ones. 40 ones we can write as zero ones and four tens. And so that looks like the place where they, where Don stopped computing. So he's on his way to solving the whole thing he just partially computed it so far. But just by doing that, we know what the Y should be. The Y should be four. So what number should Don replace the Y with? He should replace it with a four, and it's representing Y tens, or four tens."
Math,"And of course you could keep going with this computation. If Don were to say, okay, I have one ten times five, that'd be five tens, plus another four tens, that's nine tens. And then last but not least, if Don wanted to figure out, well, he's got four hundreds here times five is twenty hundreds, which we can express as zero hundreds and two thousands. Or you just do this as 20 hundreds. So they're not asking us to do the entire computation."
Math,"We're just trying to figure out what Don did essentially in this first step. What number should he have written here instead of a Y? So Y could be replaced with a four. It's representing the four, which is really in the tens place, so four tens.."
Math,"And I'm going to do it using what's often known as the standard algorithm. Algorithm is just a fancy word for a series of steps, a process for doing something. So we have 6742 times 23. And so I'm gonna write the 23 in the same place values. So that's two 10s, so I'm gonna write it under the four 10s over there. And then three ones. I'll write it under the two ones. And it's important to realize this isn't the only way to multiply numbers. In fact, we've studied other methods for doing it in other videos."
Math,"And it's important to realize what's really going on and how these different methods are all, on some level, doing the same thing, maybe just writing them different or doing them in different orders. So the way that we would tackle it using the standard algorithm, probably the way that your parents first learned to multiply multi-digit numbers like this is we'll take all of the numbers in 6742, all of the various places, and multiply it by three. And then we're gonna multiply it times two 10s."
Math,"And then we're gonna add everything up. So let's first multiply it times three. So we have two times three, that is six. Then we have four times three. And what people often say is, ""Four times three is 12, write the two, ""and then carry the one."" But what really just happened is you said four 10s times three is 12 10s. 12 10s can be written as two 10s plus 100. Then we say seven times three is 21."
Math,"And then you'll say, ""Oh, I have to add that other one, ""so I get 22."" But once again, what just happened? We said seven hundreds times three is 2100 plus another hundred is 22 hundreds, which can be expressed as two hundreds and two thousands. And then, last but not least, six times three is 18 plus two is 20. But remember, we're talking about thousands. So this is 20 thousands. So then we will move on to the two 10s right over here. So two times two 10s is four 10s."
Math,"Now some folks might be tempted to put the four over there, but that's not four 10s. Four 10s would be right over here. And so it's common practice as you move to the next place value over, as you get to this two, that people will just put a zero here just so they don't make that mistake. All right, now let's keep going. What is four times two? Well that's eight. We'll just write the eight right over there."
Math,"Why did that work? Well we're having four 10s times two 10s, well that's going to be eight times 10 times 10, eight hundreds. And then we say what is seven times two. That is 14, which of course we can write the four and then we can carry the one, so to speak. And I'll cross these out so I don't get confused. And then six times two is going to be equal to 12, plus this one that we had carried, is 13. So there we go. And then we just have to add everything up."
Math,"And we are going to get six plus zero ones is six. Two 10s plus four 10s is six 10s. Two hundreds plus eight hundreds is 10 hundreds, which you could do as zero hundreds and one thousand. One thousand plus zero thousands plus four thousands is five thousands. Two 10 thousands plus three 10 thousands is going to be five 10 thousands. And then we just have one hundred thousand right over there. So we've got 155,066. And we are done.."
Math,"Alright, so let's think about this together, and I'm gonna show you how my brain likes to handle this. We'll do this out on my little digital blackboard, but eventually you'll be able to do things like this in your head. So 2,400 or 2,400 divided by 30, that is the same thing as 2,400 over 30. So this is just another way of saying 2,400 divided by 30."
Math,"Now the reason why I wrote it this way is because you can now write each of these, the numerator and the denominator as the product of some number and either 10 or 100 or 1,000. So 2,400, that's the same thing as 24 times 100, and I knew that. I was like, okay, I've got these two zeros at the end, so you could view this literally as 24 hundreds, and then 30 you can view as, we got one zero here, so it's three tens. The three is in the tens place. So three times 10."
Math,"Now what's valuable about thinking of it this way is you can separately divide the 24 by the three and then the 100 by the 10, so this is the same thing as, lemme do this this way, as that times that. And so we have 24 divided by three times 100 divided by 10. Now 24 divided by three, you might already know that is going to be eight. Three times eight is 24."
Math,"So this is going to be equal to eight, and what's 100 divided by 10? Well, 100 divided by 10 is just going to be 10, so our quotient, I guess you could say, is going to be eight times 10, or it's going to be equal to 80, and we're done. And you might notice something interesting here. So if I take my 24 and divide it by my three, I'm gonna get this eight, and then if I take two zeros and if I take away another zero, I'm gonna be left with one zero right over here."
Math,"So you get 80, but why did that thing with the zeros work? Because you're really just taking 2,400 hundreds divided by three tens. So 100 divided by 10, well, you're gonna lose a zero. That's gonna be equal to 10, which has only one zero. Let's do another example just to hit the point home, and try to do this next example the way we just did it, maybe in your head or maybe on a piece of paper."
Math,"So let's say we wanted to calculate 3,500, which you could also think of as 3,500, and we wanna divide that by, lemme write the division symbol a little bit nicer than that. We wanna divide that by 700. Pause this video and see if you can compute that. So as we just did, we could view this as 3,500 over 700. 3,500 we can view as 35 times 100 over, this is going to be over. Lemme get the right color here, over seven times 100. Now the one hundreds cancel out, and we're just left with 35 over seven."
Math,"Now what's 35 divided by seven? Well, that is going to be equal to five, and notice, you could just say 35 divided by seven is five, and if you're saying, ""How many zeros do I have left over?"" Well, I have two zeros here, but since I'm dividing by something with two zeros, those two zeros are going to be canceled out. I don't want you to just memorize that. The reason why that happens is because those two zeros here represent hundreds, 35 hundreds."
Math,"These two zeros represent hundreds, so if you divide 100 by hundreds, they're all gonna cancel out. So you had two zeros before, but you're dividing by something with the two zeros, so you don't have any zeros after the five here. Lemme do one more example just to really hit that point home, but I want you to appreciate that it's not just some magical trick. It just makes sense out of things that you might already know."
Math,"So if someone, and I'm gonna give a crazy one, let's say we had 42 million divided by, let's say, 60,000. What is that going to be? Pause the video and see if you can think about it on your own. Well, using the notions that we just talked about, you could say, ""Alright, 42 divided by six ""is going to be seven."" And then if I, let's see, over here I have six zeros, so we're talking about millions, and I'm gonna divide by four zeros right over here, which is 10 thousands."
Math,"So if you had six zeros, or if you have millions with six zeros and you divide by 10 thousands with four zeros, six minus four is gonna be two, so your answer's gonna have two zeros in it. So this is going to be equal to 700. Now once again, not a magical trick, the way that we got this is that this is equal to 42 times a million. We got our six zeros right over there divided by six 10 thousands, six times 10,000."
Math,"So our 42 divided by six, that's where we get the seven from, and now one way to think about it, if we divide the numerator and the denominator by 10, we lose a zero. Then we do it again. We lose zeros. We do it again. We lose zeros. We do it again. We lose zeros, and so this thing just all becomes one, or another way to think about it, if we divide the numerator and the denominator by 10,000, this becomes one."
Math,"This thing loses four zeros, and you're left with, 42 divided by six is seven hundreds, because we have a one now in the denominator, 100 divided by one, so 700.."
Math,"But, the whole point here is to get some practice estimating. Pause this video and try to see if you can figure this out without even using any pencil or paper. All right, so now let's do this together. I'll tell you what my brain does. My brain says that look, 794 is awfully close to 800 and then 18 is close to 20. I would say this is going to be roughly the same thing as 800, is gonna be roughly equal to 800 divided by 20."
Math,"Is it going to be exactly equal? No, but these are the numbers closest to the numbers there that it's easy for me to divide in my head. For example, I would then say, if I was just doing this purely in my head, I would say, well, 100 divided by 20 is five, so 800 divided by 20 is equal to 40. Another way to think about it, 800 over 20. If we divide the numerator and the denominator by 10, it's the same thing as 80 over 2, which is equal to 40."
Math,"So 794 divided by 18 definitely isn't exactly 40, but it's going to be close to 40, and especially of these choices right over here. It's definitely gonna be much closer to 40 than 80, 4, or definitely 400. So, we're gonna go with that. Let's get another example here, make sure we get enough practice. Once again, we are asked to estimate 722 divided by 68. Why don't you have a go at it. Pause the video and try to see if you can figure out what it is and try to do it in your head."
Math,"Well, what I would do in my head, I would say, well look, 722, this is awfully close to 700, and 68 is awfully close to 70. And then, this is quite straightforward to do in your head, 700 divided by 70 is going to be equal to 10. And, good for us, there's a choice here that is awfully close to what we approximated. Now, if you don't find your exact answer here, that's okay 'cause remember, it's an approximation. You should find the answer that is closest to what you estimated."
Math,"But, whoever wrote this question had a very similar thought process. They said, okay, 722, pretty close to 700. And 68, pretty close to 70. And so it's gonna be approximately equal to 700 divided by 70.."
Math,"I didn't call it long division then, but I think the reason why is it takes you a long time or it takes a long piece of your paper. As you go along, you kind of have this thing, this long tail that develops on the problem. So all of those are, at least, reasons in my head why it's called long division. But we saw in the last video there's a way to tackle any division problem while just knowing your multiplication tables up to maybe 10 times 10 or 12 times 12."
Math,"But just as a bit of review, this is the same thing as 2,292 divided by 4. And it's actually the same thing, and you probably haven't seen this notation before, as 2,292 divided by 4. This, this, and this are all equivalent statements on some level. And you could say, hey Sal, that looks like a fraction in case you have seen fractions already. And that is exactly what it is. It is a fraction. But anyway, I'll just focus on this format and in future videos we'll think about other ways to represent division."
Math,"So let's do this problem. So 4 goes into 2 how many times? It goes into 2 no times, so let's move on to-- let me just switch colors. So let's move on to the 22. 4 goes into 22 how many times? Let's see. 4 times 5 is equal to 20. 4 times 6 is equal to 24. So 6 is too much. So 4 goes into 22 five times. 5 times 4 is 20. There's going to be a little bit of a leftover. And then we subtract 22 minus 20. Well that's just 2. And then you bring down this 9. And you saw in the last video exactly what this means."
Math,"When you wrote this 5 up here-- notice we wrote in the 100's place. So this is really a 500. But in this video I'm just going to focus more on the process, and you can think more about what it actually means in terms of where I'm writing the numbers. But I think the process is going to be crystal clear hopefully, by the end of this video. So we brought down the 9. 4 goes into 29 how many times? It goes into at least six times. What's 4 times 7? 4 times 7 is 28. So it goes into it at least seven times."
Math,"What's 4 times 8? 4 times 8 is 32, so it can't go into it eight times so it's going to go into it seven. 4 goes into 29 nine seven times. 7 times 4 is 28. 29 minus 28 to get our remainder for this step in the problem is 1. And now we're going to bring down this 2. We're going to bring it down and you get a 12. 4 goes into 12? That's easy. 4 times 3 is 12. 4 goes into 12 three times. 3 times 4 is 12. 12 minus 12 is 0. We have no remainder. So 4 goes into 2,292 exactly 573 times."
Math,"So this 2,292 divided by 4 we can say is equal to 573. Or we could say that this thing right here is equal to 573. Let's do a couple of more. Let's do a few more problems. So I'll do that red color. Let's say we had 7 going into 6,475. Maybe it's called long division because you write it nice and long up here and you have this line. I don't know. There's multiple reasons why it could be called long division. So you say 7 goes into 6 zero times. So we need to keep moving forward. So then we go to 64."
Math,"7 goes into 64 how many times? Let's see. 7 times 7 is? Well, that's way too small. Let me think about it a little bit. Well 7 times 9 is 63. That's pretty close. And then 6 times 10 is going to be too big. 7 times 10 is 70. So that's too big. So 7 goes into 64 nine times. 9 times 7 is 63. 64 minus 63 to get our remainder of this stage 1. Bring down the 7. 7 goes into 17 how many times? Well, 7 times 2 is 14. And then 7 times 3 is 21. So 3 is too big. So 7 goes into 17 two times. 2 times 7 is 14."
Math,"17 minus 14 is 3. And now we bring down the 5. And 7 goes into 35? That's in our 7 multiplication tables, five times. 5 times 7 is 35. And there you go. So the remainder is zero. So all the examples I did so far had no remainders. Let's do one that maybe might have a remainder. And to ensure it has a remainder I'll just make up the problem. It's much easier to make problems that have remainders than the ones that don't have remainders."
Math,"So let's say I want to divide 3 into-- I'm going to divide it into, let's say 1,735,092. This will be a nice, beastly problem. So if we can do this we can handle everything. So it's 1,735,092. That's what we're dividing 3 into. And actually, I'm not sure if this will have a remainder. In the future video I'll show you how to figure out whether something is divisible by 3. Actually, we can do it right now. We can just add up all these digits. 1 plus 7 is 8. 8 plus 3 is 11. 11 5 five is 16. 16 plus 9 is 25."
Math,"25 plus 2 is 27. So actually, this number is divisible by 3. So if you add up all of the digits, you get 27. And then you can add up those digits-- 2 plus 7 is 9. So that is divisible by 9. That's a trick that only works for 3. So this number actually is divisible by 3. So let me change it a little bit, so it's not divisible by 3. Let me make this into a 1. Now this number will not be divisible by 3. I definitely want a number where I'll end up with a remainder. Just so you see what it looks like."
Math,"So let's do this one. 3 goes into 1 zero times. So we can just move forward. You could write a 0 here and multiply that out, but that just makes it a little bit messy in my head. So we just move one to the right. 3 goes into 17 how many times? Well, 3 times 5 is equal to 15. And 3 times 6 is equal to 18 and that's too big. So 3 goes into 17 right here five times. 5 times 3 is 15. And we subtract. 17 minus 15 is 2. And now we bring down this 3. 3 goes into 23 how many times? Well, 3 times 7 is equal to 21."
Math,"And 3 times 8 is too big. That's equal to 24. So 3 goes into 23 seven times. 7 times 3 is 21. Then we subtract. 23 minus 21 is 2. Now we bring down the next number. We bring down the 5. I think you can appreciate why it's called long division now. We bring down this 5. 3 goes into 25 how many times? Well, 3 times 8 gets you pretty close and 3 times 9 is too big. So it goes into it eight times. 8 times 3 is 24. I'm going to run out of space. You subtract, you get 1. 25 minus 24 is 1."
Math,"Now we can bring down this 0. And you get 3 goes into 10 how many times? That's easy. It goes into it three times. 3 times 3 is 9. That's about as close to 10 as we can get. 3 times 3 is 9. 10 minus 9, I'm going to have to scroll up and down here a little bit. 10 minus 9 is 1, and then we can bring down the next number. I'm running out of colors. I can bring down that 9. 3 goes into 19 how many times? Well, 6 is about as close as we can get. That gets us to 18. 3 goes into 19 six times."
Math,"6 times 3-- let me scroll down. 6 times 3 is 18. 19 minus 18-- we subtract it up here too. 19 minus 18 is 1 and then we're almost done. I can revert back to the pink. We bring down this 1 right there. 3 goes into 11 how many times? Well, that's three times because 3 times 4 is too big. 3 times 4 is 12, so that's too big. So it goes into it three times. So 3 goes into 11 three times. 3 times 3 is 9. And then we subtract and we get a 2. And there's nothing left to bring down."
Math,"When we look up here there's nothing left to bring down, so we're done. So we're left with the remainder of 2 after doing this entire problem. So the answer, 3 goes into 1,735,091-- it goes into it 578,363 remainder 2. And that remainder 2 was what we got all the way down there. So hopefully you now appreciate and you can tackle pretty much any division problem. And you also, through this exercise, can appreciate why it's called long division.."
Math,"And of course, we could also write this as 186 divided by 31. Pause the video, and see if you can figure it out. All right, now let's work through this together. I assumed you've given it a go at it. So I don't have my 31 times tables memorized, so I can't just immediately tell you the answer. But my brain tries to approximate these numbers so that my times tables knowledge does come in handy. For example, 31 is close to 30."
Math,"And this is why I'm saying it's a bit of an art, but I'm saying, hey, look, this is pretty close to 30. And if I think about multiples of 30, well, those are just the multiples of three with an extra zero or the multiples of three times 10. So the multiples of 30 are 30, 60, 90. Instead of three times four is 12, 30 times four is 120, 150 instead of 15, 180 instead of 18 for 30 times six, and gee, this looks pretty close to 180. So this looks close times six."
Math,"And if this is close to 30, well, maybe, maybe this is, maybe this is going to be six right over here. And I'm gonna put a question mark because then the natural thing to do is to actually try it out. Figure out what is six times 31? I'll put the question mark here again. Is this equal to six? Well, the art part is you've made a good, or we've made a good guess here. Now let's try to verify that maybe it is six, maybe it isn't. So let's multiply or let's multiple 31 times six."
Math,"times six, one times six is six, and then three times six, which is really 30 times six, is gonna be 180 right over here. So this is 186. So it all works out. 186 divided by 31 is indeed six. We can get rid of this question mark here. Let's do another example. So let me delete. Let me delete that as well. Let's say we want to figure out what 336 divided by 48 is equal to. So pause this video, and see if you can figure it out."
Math,"So the way I would think about it, this thing right over here is close to 50, close to 50. And this thing, well, if you think about the multiples of 50, you have things like 300, which would be 50 times six. And then you have 350, which would be 50 times seven, because five times seven is 35. And so let's think about this, and actually let me write these things down. If I were to say 50 times six, that's the same thing as, well, that's gonna be five times six times 10, which is 300."
Math,"If I say 50 times seven, that's going to be 350. Five times seven is 35, and then you're multiplying that by 10. But this number is someplace in between 300 and 350. So my candidates for what this is going to be, well, I'm saying, hey, maybe this is six, maybe this is seven. And what I would do is I would try out each of them. So let's try out 48 times six. So let's try that, this first candidate out. times six, so eight times six is going to be 48. Four times six is 24, plus four is 288."
Math,"So that actually seems a good bit lower than this. It actually seems almost exactly 48 lower. So I could probably, I'm feeling pretty confident that I can squeeze another 48 into this. So instead of squeezing, instead of being able to divide 6/48 into this, I'm feeling pretty good that maybe seven is the answer, but let me try it out. So this, so six is not going to be my answer, I tried it out. Let me try 48 times seven."
Math,"times seven, eight times seven is 56, four times seven is 28, plus three, That's exactly right. So there you have it, with a little bit of trial and error, but it was an informed trial and error, we got 336 divided by 48 is equal to seven. This is what I meant, that it's a bit of an art.."
Math,"And we write it this way because it's easier to manipulate the numbers, kind of doing the standard process here. And as we'll see, whenever we divide by a number that has more than one digit, there's a little bit of an art to it. And hopefully you'll get an appreciation for that art over the course of this video. So first we could think about well, how many times does 65 go into 9? Well it doesn't go into 9 at all so we can move one digit to the right."
Math,"How many times does it go into 98 without going over it? Well 65 times 1 is 65 so that doesn't go over it. And 65 times 2, well that would be 130 so that would go over 98. So it only goes one time. We multiply 1 times 65, which is 65. And then we could subtract to see how much we have left over. So 8 minus 5 is 3 and 9 minus 6 is 3. And now we can bring down the next digit, this 1 here."
Math,"And now this is where the art is going to come into play because we need to figure out how many times does 65 go into 331 without going over it. And you might just try to look at these numbers, try to approximate them a little bit. You might say, well, maybe 65, let me round this thing up. Maybe this is close to 70. And let's see, this is close to 300. So maybe we say, well, 70 would go into 300."
Math,"So maybe we think about how many times does 70 go into 300? And we say without going over it, it doesn't go exactly into 300. Well you could say, well how many times does 7 go into 30? Well we know 7 goes into 30 four times. 4 times 7 is 28. So maybe try a 4 right over here because then this will be 280, 4 times 70 is 280. You're still going to have a little bit left over, but what you have left over is going to be less than 70. It's going to be 20."
Math,"So you say, well, if this is roughly 70 and if this is roughly 300, then maybe it's going to be the same thing. So let's try that out. Let's see if it goes four times. So 4 times 5 is 20, carry the 2. 4 times 6 is 24 plus 2 is 26. And now let's see how much we had left over. So when we subtract, we are left with-- I'll do this in a new color-- 1 minus 0 is 1. We have a 3 here and a 6 here so we're going to have to do a little regrouping. Let's take 100 from the hundreds place. It becomes 200."
Math,"Give those 10 tens, that 100, to the tens place. So now we have 13 tens. 13 minus 6 is 7 and then 2 minus 2 is 1. So did this work out? Well no, our remainder, after we said it went in four times, we actually had 71 left over. 71, this right over here, is larger than 65. You don't want a situation where what you have left over is larger than what you're trying to divide into the number. You could have gone into it one more time because you had so much left over. So this 4 was actually too low."
Math,"We should have probably approximated this as 60, and 60 goes into 300, if we were to estimate, we'd say, well that might be closer to five times. So this is where the art of this comes into play. So it was very reasonable to do what I just did, but it just turned out to not be the right way to think about it. I could just say, well the 4 wasn't enough. I had too much left over. Let me try 5 now. 5 times 5 is 25, carry the 2. 5 times 6 is 30, plus 2 is 32. There you go."
Math,"We got much closer to 331 without going over. Now we can subtract. And once again, we could do a little regrouping. Take a 10 from the tens place. This becomes two tens. This becomes an 11. 11 minus 5 is 6, 2 minus 2 is 0, 3 minus 3 is 0. So we only have 6 left over, which is obviously less than 65. So we're all good. And if we put a 6 here, we would have gone over 331. And so that wouldn't have been cool either. But anyway, let's bring down the next digit. Let's bring down the 5."
Math,"So how many times does 65 go into 65? Well, it goes one time. 1 times 65,-- OK. Ignore this, that's from a previous step-- 1 times 65 is 65. And then you subtract, and we have no remainder. So we see that 65 goes into 9,815 exactly 150-- let me just that in that same blue color, I don't want to do all these arbitrary colors-- 151 times.."
Math,"How many times does 42 go into 71? Well, it goes into 71 one time. Just a reminder, whoever's doing the process where you say, hey, 42 goes into 71 one time. But what we're really saying, 42 goes into 7,100 100 times because we're putting this one in the hundreds place. But let's put that on the side for a little bit and focus on the process. So 1 times 42 is 42, and now we subtract. Now, you might be able to do 71 minus 42 in your head, knowing, hey, 72 minus 42 would be 30."
Math,"So 71 minus 42 would be 29, but we could also do it by regrouping. To regroup, you want to subtract a 2 from a 1. You can't really do that in any traditional way. So let's take a 10 from the 70, so that it becomes a 60, and give that 10 to the ones place, and then that becomes an 11. And so 11 minus 2 is 9, and 6 minus 4 is 2. So you get 29. And we can bring down the next place value. Bring down an 8. And now, this is where the art happens when we're dividing by a multi-digit number right over here."
Math,"We have to estimate how many times does 42 go into 298. And sometimes it might involve a little bit of trial and error. So you really just kind of have to eyeball it. If you make a mistake, try again. The way you know you make a mistake is, if say it goes into it 9 times, and you do 9 times 42 and you get a number larger than 298, then you overestimated. If you say it goes into it three times, you do 3 times 42, you get some number here."
Math,"When you subtract, you get something larger than 42, then you also made a mistake, and you have to adjust upwards. Well, let's see if we can eyeball it. So this is roughly 40. This is roughly 300. 40 goes into 300 the same times as 4 goes into the 30, so it's going to be roughly 7. Let's see if that's right. 7 times 2 is 14. 7 times 1 is 28, plus 1 is 29. So I got pretty close. My remainder here-- notice 294 is less than 298. So I'm cool there. And my remainder is less than 42, so I'm cool as well."
Math,"So now let's add another place value. Let's bring this 2 down. And here we're just asking ourselves, how many times does 42 go into 42? Well, 42 goes into 42 exactly one time. 1 times 42 is 42, and we have no remainder. So this one luckily divided exactly. 42 goes into 7,182 exactly 171 times.."
Math,"And if there is a remainder, figure out what that remainder is going to be. All right, now let's work on this together. So first let me rewrite 4,781 and this is going to be divided by 32. Now whenever we divide by anything that has more than one digit, so it's a little bit of an art. The way we're going to tackle it is a little trial and error using estimation. So we'll start by saying ""Hey, ""how many times does 32 go into four?"" Well, 32 doesn't go into four at all, so then we'll move on."
Math,"How many times does 32 go into 47? Well it's pretty clear that 32 goes one time into 47. So I'll put the one right over there, above the seven in 47. And if you're saying, ""Hey, how did Sal know that?"" Well, just remember, two times 32 would be 64. That's more than 47. So 32 goes into 47 one time, and we multiply one times 32. One times two is two, one times three is three. You know that one times 32 is 32. And then we subtract 32 from 47."
Math,"Let's do that, and we get seven minus two is five and four minus three is one. And the way you make sure that you did that step right is whatever we get over here should be less than 32. If whatever we have here is 32 or greater, that means we could of had a larger number up here. But then our next step is we bring down the eight and we say, ""How many times does 32 go into 158?"" Now this is a little bit tricky. If you were estimating how many times does 30 go into 150, you might say five."
Math,"And actually this is for kicks, let's just try that out. Let's see if five works. So let's see, five times two is 10. We'll put zero ones and then we will have one 10 there, carry the one. Fives times three is 15, plus one is 16. So that didn't work out. It almost worked out, but not quite. 160 is larger 158 so five is too much there. So we need to go down to four. So four times two is eight. Four times three is 12."
Math,"And now we subtract and 158 minus 128, eight mins eight is zero, five tens minus two tens is three tens, and then we have no hundreds. And then this is right, 'cause 30 is less than 32. And then we can bring down, we can bring down that one. Now how many times does 32 go into 301? Well we might be tempted to say, ""Well, this is close to 30, ""this is close to 300, so maybe it's 10."" But 10 times 32 would be 320, so that'd be too much. So I feel good about nine as my estimate."
Math,"Nine times two is 18, carry the one. Nine times three is 27, plus one is 28. And then we can subtract. We're actually going to have to do a little regrouping here. You might be able to do it in your head. To go from 288 to 301, let's see, you would add 12 to get to 300 and then one more, 13. So you might be able to do it in your head that this is going to be 13, or you could regroup."
Math,"You could say, ""All right, let's see, ""one is less than eight, can I regroup from the 10s place? ""No, I have nothing there so I have to regroup ""from the hundreds place. ""So I'm gonna take one of those hundreds, ""I'm left with two hundreds left. ""And then I'm going to have 10 10s. ""And then I could take one of those 10s, ""so I have nine 10s left, and give it to the ones place ""so now I have 11 ones."
Math,"""And 11 minus eight is 3, nine 10s minus eight 10s ""is one 10, and then hundreds, ""200 minus 200 is just a zero."" And so there we have it, this is less than 32. We have nothing left to bring down and so we're left with the remainder of 13. So this is going to be equal to 149 with a remainder of 13, and we're done.."
Math,"This third expression is 5 times 2 over 3 times 5. And what I want you to do is pause this video right now and think about which of these expressions is the largest, which one is in the middle in terms of value, and which one is the smallest. And I want you to think about it without actually doing the calculation. If you could just look at them and figure out which of these is the largest, which of these is the smallest, and which of these is in the middle. So pause the video now."
Math,"Now, you might have taken a shot at it. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint in case you had trouble with it. All of these involve multiplying something by 2/3. And you see a 2/3 here. You see a 2/3 here. And it might not be as obvious, but you also see a 2/3 here. And let me rewrite that to make it a little bit clearer. So this first expression could be rewritten as 7/8 times 2/3. This second expression here could be written as-- well, it's already written as 8/7 times 2/3."
Math,"And then, this last expression, we could write it as, in the numerator, 5 times 2. And then in the denominator, it's over 5 times 3. 5 times 3, which is of course the same thing as 5/5 times So you see, all three of these expressions involve something times 2/3. Now, looking at it this way, does it become easier to pick out which of these are the largest, which of these are the smallest, and which of these are someplace in between? I encourage you to pause it again if you haven't thought about it yet."
Math,"So let's visualize each of these expressions by first trying to visualize 2/3. So let's say the height of what I am drawing right now, let's say the height of this bar right over here is 2/3. So this right over here represents 2/3. The height here is 2/3. So first, let's think about what this one on the right here represents. This is 5/5 times 2/3. Well, what's 5/5? 5/5 is the same thing as 1. This is literally just 1 times 2/3. This whole expression is the same thing as 1 times 2/3, or really, just 2/3."
Math,"So this, the height here, 2/3, this is the same thing as this thing over here. This is going to be equal to-- this could also be viewed as 5 times 2 over 3 times 5, which was this first expression right over here. Now, let's think about what these would look like. So this is 7/8 times 2/3. So it's less than 8/8 times 2/3. It's less than 1 times 2/3. So we're going to scale 2/3 down. This is going to be less than 2/3. It's going to be 7/8 of 2/3. So this one right over here would look something like this."
Math,"Let me see if I can draw it. Yeah, it would look something like this. If the yellow height is 2/3, then this right over here, then this height right over here-- let me make it clear. This height right over here would be 7/8 times 2/3. Likewise, let's look at this one right over here. Let's look at this one in the middle, 8/7 times 2/3. Well, 8/7 is bigger than 7/7. It's more than 1. This is more than 2/3. This is 1 and 1/7 times 2/3. So it's going to be the same height as 2/3 plus another 1/7."
Math,"So it's going to look something like this. It's going to look something like this. So its height-- now we scaled the 2/3 up because 8/7 is greater than 1. So this right over here, this height is going to be 8/7 times 2/3. So the way that you could have spotted which of these is the largest and which of these is the smallest is to say, well, how are they scaling 2/3? This one right over here, you're essentially multiplying 2/3 by 1. So you're just going to get 2/3."
Math,"You're not scaling it up, or you aren't scaling it down. This one right over here, you're scaling 2/3 down. You are multiplying it by something less than 1. If you multiply it by something less than 1, then you're going to be scaling it down. I should say, a positive number or a number between 0 and 1-- less than 1-- then you're going to be scaling it down. So this thing is scaled down. It's going to be the smallest. And here, you're multiplying the 2/3 times a number bigger than 1, by 1 and 1/7."
Math,"So you're going to scale it up. So this expression is the largest, 8/7 times 2/3. The smallest is 2/3 times 7/8. And this one right over here is in between.."
Math,"So what do you think it is? How does 1/4 times 5,000 compare to 5,000? And how do you know your answer is correct? Pick one of these choices as well. Pause the video and have a go at that. Well, one way to think about it, if I'm multiplying 5,000 times some value, that value is going to scale 5,000. It's going to make it smaller or bigger or in certain cases, might not change the size at all. In fact, the ones where you don't change 5,000 was you multiply it by one. So one times 5,000 is equal to 5,000."
Math,"But what do you think is going to happen when you multiply a value that is between zero and one times 5,000? Is that going to be greater than, equal to, or less than 5,000? Well one way to imagine it is on a number line. If this is zero, this is 5,000. This would be halfway between zero and 5,000. And if I then make it the space between zero and 5,000 into fourths, this would be 1/4 of the way between zero and 5,000. So this value right over here, that is 1/4 times 5,000."
Math,"Well, how does this value, 1/4 times 5,000, compare to this value, to 5,000? Well, it's clear that 1/4 times 5,000 is less than, is less than 5,000. And in general, if the value is between zero and one that you're multiplying by something else, it's going to make the thing you're multiplying smaller. If this were one, it's not going to change the value. And if this were greater than one, it would make it larger. So let's see these choices."
Math,"Because we are multiplying 5,000 by a fraction that is less than one. Yeah, that's exactly what's happening. We're multiplying 5,000 by 1/4. So it's going to give us a smaller value than 5,000. I like that choice. Let's just read these other ones. Because we are multiplying 5,000 by a fraction that is equal to one. Well no, 1/4 is clearly not equal to one, so we rule that one out. Because we are multiplying 5,000 by a fraction that is greater than one."
Math,"Well 1/4 is clearly not greater than one, so we rule that out as well. Let's do another example. So here we're asked, is the product of each expression less than, equal to, or greater than 49? So pause this video and try to figure it out. All right, so this first one is 49 times 7/8. So what do you think that's going to be? Well, 7/8 is less than one. So if I multiply 49 times something less than one, I'm going to get a value that is less than 49. So I like that choice right over there. 49 times 5/2."
Math,"Well, 5/2 is greater than one. Remember, 2/2 would be equal to one. So 5/2 is greater than one. So if I'm multiplying 49 by a value that is greater than one, I'm going to get a value that is greater than 49. And then last but not least, 49 times 3/3. Well, 3/3 is exactly equal to one. So 49 times one is going to be exactly equal to 49, and we're done.."
Math,"Five times 1/3 is gonna be 5/3. Or you could say five 1/3, which is the same thing as 5/3, hopefully that makes some sense. Let's do some more examples here. So let's say we need to figure out, so let's see, it says move the orange dot to the number that equals two times 4/3. Alright, so one times 4/3 is just gonna get us to 4/3, and then if we have another 4/3, we're gonna add 4/3 to that, so we're gonna move another 4/3 to the right. So 4/3 plus 4/3 would get us to 8/3."
Math,"8/3, I'm having trouble moving this, 8/3. So one times 4/3 is just 4/3, and then two times 4/3 is 8/3. And notice that's the same thing as two times four, which is eight, over three, 8/3. Let's do one more of these. So, move the orange dot to the number that equals three times 3/2. So this is gonna be 0/2, that's just zero, so you could do that a zero times 3/2. One times 3/2, well that will just get us to 3/2. Two times 3/2, we'll add another 3/2, so that'll get us to 6/2."
Math,"And then three times 3/2, we'll add another 3/2, that gets us to 9/2, and we're done.."
Math,"The other way to think about this is that you start with 5 things. So let's say, that's 1 thing. Let me copy and paste that so they all look the same. So then let me paste it. So that's 2 things. That's 3 things. That's 4 things. And that's 5 things. So the other way to think about it is you start with 5 things, and you take 1/2 of them. So what would be 1/2 of this? Well, let's see. You have 5 things, so you would get-- 5 divided by 2 would be 2 and 1/2. So you would get this far."
Math,"Let me make it like this. So you would get this one. You would get this one. And you would get this one. Now, is this the same thing as 5/2? Well, what happens if we divide each of these wholes into halves? So let's do that. So if we just multiplied-- so we just divide each of these into 2. So instead of having 5 wholes, we now have 10 halves. How many of those halves have we filled in? Well, we have filled in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So this is also equal to 5/2."
Math,"So far we just did it thinking about what multiplication actually means. But if you said, well, how did I compute this? Well, the way you could think about it, and multiplying fractions is actually straightforward from that point of view, is as long as you can express both of them as fractions, and 5 we already know is the same thing as 5 ones, so this we can just multiply times 5/1. So now that I've expressed both of them as fractions, I can just multiply the numerator. So 1 times 5 over 2 times 1."
Math,"And what's that going to be equal to? Well, 1 times 5 is 5. 2 times 1 is 2. So once again, we get 5/2.."
Math,"And so this represents two of those fifths. This is the first of the fifths, and then this is the second of the fifths, Literally 2/5, 2/5, 2/5. Now let's think about something a little bit more interesting. What would 3 times 2/5 represent? 3 times 2/5. And I encourage you to pause this video and, based on what we just did here, think about what you think this would be equivalent to."
Math,"Well, we just saw that 2/5 would be the same thing as-- so let me just rewrite this as instead of 3 times 2/5 written like this, let me write 2/5 like that-- so this is the same thing as 3 times 2 times 1/5. And multiplication, we can multiply the 2 times the 1/5 first and then multiply by the 3, or we can multiply the 3 times the 2 first and then multiply by the 1/5. So you could view this literally as being equal to 3 times 2 is, of course, 6, so this is the same thing as 6 times 1/5."
Math,"And if we were to try to visualize that again, so that's a whole. That's another whole. Each of those wholes have been divided into five equal sections. And so we're going to color in six of them. So that's the first 1/5, second 1/5, third 1/5, fourth 1/5, fifth 1/5-- and that gets us to a whole-- and then we have 6/5 just like that. So literally 3 times 2/5 can be viewed as 6/5."
Math,"And of course, 6 times 1/5, or 6/5, can be written as-- so this is equal to, literally-- let me do the same color-- 6/5, 6 over 5. Now you might have said, well, what if we, instead of viewing 2/5 as this, as we just did in this example, we view 2/5 as 1/5 plus 1/5, what would happen then? Well, let's try it out. So 3 times 2/5-- I'll rewrite it-- 3 times 2/5, 2 over 5, is the same thing as 3 times 1/5 plus 1/5. 2/5 is the same thing as 1/5 plus 1/5."
Math,"So 3 times 1/5 plus 1/5 which would be equal to-- well, I just have to have literally three of these added together. So it's going to be 1/5 plus 1/5 plus 1/5 plus 1/5 plus-- I think you get the idea here-- plus 1/5 plus 1/5. Well, what's this going to be? Well, we literally have 6/5 here. We can ignore the parentheses and just add all of these together. We, once again, have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6/5. So once again, this is equal to 6/5."
Math,"So hopefully this shows that when you multiply-- The 2/5 we saw already represents two 1/5s. We already saw that, or 2 times 1/5. And 3 times 2/5 is literally the same thing as 3 times 2 times 1/5. In this case, that would be 6/5.."
Math,"And if we wanted to actually compute this, this would be equal to-- well, we're going to take these six 2's and add them together. So we could view it as 2 times 6 over 3. 2 times 6 over 3, which is the same thing, of course, as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 12/3. And what is 12/3 equal to? Well, we could rewrite 12 as-- so this is equal to-- we could rewrite 12 as 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 over the yellow 3. Let me do it like this so I don't have to keep switching colors."
Math,"This is going to be the same thing as 3/3 plus 3/3 plus 3/3 plus 3/3. And each of these are obviously a whole. Each of these equal 1. That's 1 and that's 1, so this is going to be equal to 4. So that's one way to conceptualize 2/3 times 6. Another way to think of it is as 2/3 of 6. So let's think about that. Let me draw a number line here. And I'm going to draw the number line up to 6. So what I care about is the section of the number line that goes to 6. So that looks pretty good."
Math,"So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So if we want to take 2/3 of 6, we can think of this whole section of the number line between 0 and 6 as the whole. And then we want to take 2/3 of that. So how do we do that? Well, we divide it into thirds, to three equals sections. So that's one equal section, two equal sections, and three equal sections. And we want two of those thirds. So we want 1/3 and 2/3. Now where does that get us? That gets us to 4. So we get, obviously, to the same answer."
Math,"We would be in a tough situation if somehow we got two different answers. Either way, 2/3 times 6 or 6 times 2/3, either way, that is going to be equal to 4. But there are two different ways of viewing this. This first way is literally viewing it as 2/3 six times. And this way is we're taking a fraction of the number 6. We're going 2/3 of the way to 6, which would get us to 4.."
Math,"And what do I mean there? Well let me take a whole, let me take a whole here, and let me divide it into fourths. So let me divide it into fourths, so I'll divided into 4 equal sections. And so 1/4 would be 1 of these 4 equal sections. But we want to take 1/2 of that. So how do we take half of that? Well, we could divide this into 2 equal sections, and then just take 1 of them. So divide it into 2 equal sections, and then take 1 of them."
Math,"So we're taking this pink area, this whole pink area is 1/4, and now we're going to take 1/2 of it. We're now going to take 1/2 of it. So that's this yellow square right over here. But what fraction of the whole does this yellow represent? Well, it now represents 1 out of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 equal sections. So this right over here, this represents 1/8 of the whole. And so we see conceptually that 1/2 times 1/4, it completely makes sense, that 1/2 of 1/4 should be 1/8."
Math,"And it hopefully makes sense that you get this 8 by multiplying the 2 times the 4. You started with 4 equal sections, but then you divided each of those 4 equal sections into 2 equal sections. So then you have 8 total equal sections that you split your whole into. Let's do another example, but now let's multiply two fractions that don't have 1's in the numerator. So let's multiply, let's multiply 2/3 times 4/5. And I encourage you now to pause the video and do something very similar to what I just did."
Math,"Try to represent 4/5 of a whole and then try to represent 2/3 of that 4/5 and see what fraction of the whole you actually have. So pause now. So let's think about this. Let's represent 4/5. So if I have a whole like this, let me try to divide it into 5 equal sections. 5 equal sections, so let's say that is 1 equal section, that is 2 equal sections, that is 3, 4, and 5-- I can do a better job than this. This is always the hard part."
Math,"I'm trying my best to make them look, at least, like equal sections-- 2, 3, 4, and 5. I think you get the point here. I'm trying to make them equal sections. And we want 4/5. So we want 4 of these 5 equal sections. So this would be 1 of the 5 equal sections, 2 of them, 3 of them, and then 4 of them. So that right over there is 4/5. Now we can view this as 2/3 of the 4/5. So how can we think about that? Well, we could take this section and divide it into thirds. So let's do that. Divide it into thirds."
Math,"So we're going divide it into 3 equal sections. So that's 1/3, and then 2/3. So we took each of the 5 equal sections, and we divided them into 3 equal sections. Now what's going to be 2/3 of the 4/5? Well, that's going to be this part right over here. So let me make this clear. This is 1/3 of the 4/5. And then this would be 2/3 of the 4/5."
Math,"So this right over here, would be 2/3 of the 4/5, or 2/3 times But what fraction of the whole does that represent? Well, how many total, how many total equal sections do we now Well, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, So we have 15 equal sections. I'm using a new color. We have 15 equal sections, and that make sense. We started with 5 equal sections, but then we divided each of those into 3 equal sections. So now we have 5 times 3 total equal sections."
Math,"And then how many of those are now colored in? Well, we see it's 2 times 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. How many of them are in the 2/3 of the 4/5, I should say. And there's 8 of them, 8 of the 15 equals sections. And so there you have it. It should hopefully now make visual sense, or it makes conceptual sense, that 2/3 times 4/5-- you can obviously compute it by just multiplying the numerators, 2 times 4 is 8."
Math,"And then multiplying the denominators, 3 times 5 is 15-- but hopefully this now makes conceptual sense as 2/3 of 4/5.."
Math,"So let's say that we wanted to take 3/4 and multiply it by 1/2. And we know, of course, the order that we multiply doesn't matter. This is the exact same thing as 1/2 times 3/4. So to imagine where this gets us, let's draw ourselves a number line. And I'll do it pretty large so that we have some space to work in. So that's 0. And then that is 1. And of course, our line could keep on going. And let's first imagine 3/4 times 1/2 as 3/4 of the way to 1/2. So first let's plot 1/2 on our number line."
Math,"Well, 1/2 is literally halfway between 0 and 1. So that's 1/2 right over there. And how do we think about 3/4 of the way to 1/2? Well, what we could do is think about well, what's 1/4 of 1/2? Well, we could divide this part of the number line into 4 equal sections. So that's 2 equal sections. Now that's 4 equal sections. And while we're at it, let's divide all of the halves into 4 equal sections. So let's divide all of the halves into 4 equal sections. So that's 4 sections. And now let's do this one."
Math,"I'm trying my best to draw them equal sections. So I've taken each of the halves and I've made them into 4 equal sections. So this point right over here is 1/4 of 1/2. But that's not what we care about. We want to get to 3/4 of 1/2. So we want to get to 1, 2, 3/4 of 1/2. So this point right over here, this is literally 3/4 times And this is, of course, 1/2 here. But what number is this? And let me do this in a new color. We can now visualize it on the number line."
Math,"But what number is this actually? Well, a big clue is that, well, before we had the section between 0 and 1 divided into 2 equal sections when we only had to plot 1/2. But then we took each of those 2 equal sections and then split them into 4 more sections. By doing that, we now essentially have divided the section between 0 and 1 into 8 equal sections. So each of these is actually 1/8. So this point right over here is 1/8. This is 2/8. And then this is 3/8."
Math,"And that's in line with what we've seen about multiplying fractions before. This should be equal to 3 times 1 over 4 times 2, which is equal to 3/8. And everything that we're talking about, so we don't get confused, this is all referring to this point right over here on the number line. But what if we thought about it the other way around? What if we thought about it as 1/2 of the way to 3/4? So we could divide the space between 0 and 1 into fourths. So let's do that. So that is 1/4, 2/4, 3/4."
Math,"So this right over here is the number 3/4. And we want to go half of the way to 3/4. Well, what is half of the way to 3/4? Well, we split this section into 2 equal sections. So we could split right over there. And we want to go exactly one of those sections. 1/2 of 3/4 gets us, once again, right over here to this point-- 3/8."
Math,"So either way you imagine it, whether you're essentially taking 3/4 of 1/2, or saying I'm going to go 3/4 of the way to 1/2, or you say I'm going to go 1/2 of the way to 3/4, either way, hopefully it now makes conceptual sense. You can visualize it, and it makes numeric sense that this is going to be equal to 3/8.."
Math,"Now when you're multiplying fractions, it's actually a pretty straightforward process. The new numerator, or the numerator of the product, is just the product of the two numerators, or your new top number is a product of the other two top numbers. So the numerator in our product is just 5 times 2. So it's equal to 5 times 2 over 6 times 3, which is equal to-- 5 times 2 is 10 and 6 times 3 is 18, so it's equal to 10/18."
Math,"And you could view this as either 2/3 of 5/6 or 5/6 of 2/3, depending on how you want to think about it. And this is the right answer. It is 10/18, but when you look at these two numbers, you immediately or you might immediately see that they share some common factors. They're both divisible by 2, so if we want it in lowest terms, we want to divide them both by 2. So divide 10 by 2, divide 18 by 2, and you get 10 divided by 2 is 5, 18 divided by 2 is 9."
Math,"Now, you could have essentially done this step earlier on. You could've done it actually before we did the multiplication. You could've done it over here. You could've said, well, I have a 2 in the numerator and I have something divisible by 2 into the denominator, so let me divide the numerator by 2, and this becomes a 1. Let me divide the denominator by 2, and this becomes a 3. And then you have 5 times 1 is 5, and 3 times 3 is 9. So it's really the same thing we did right here."
Math,"We just did it before we actually took the product. You could actually do it right here. So if you did it right over here, you'd say, well, look, 6 times 3 is eventually going to be the denominator. 5 times 2 is eventually going to be the numerator. So let's divide the numerator by 2, so this will become a 1. Let's divide the denominator by 2. This is divisible by 2, so that'll become a 3. And it'll become 5 times 1 is 5 and 3 times 3 is 9. So either way you do it, it'll work."
Math,"If you do it this way, you get to see the things factored out a little bit more, so it's usually easier to recognize what's divisible by what, or you could do it at the end and put things in lowest terms.."
Math,"It's very difficult, or at least it's not easy for me, to directly multiply mixed numbers. One can do it, but it's much easier if you just make them improper fractions. So let's convert each of them. So 1 and 3/4 is equal to-- it's still going to be over 4, so you're still going to have the same denominator, but your numerator as an improper fraction is going to be 4 times 1 plus 3."
Math,"And the reason why this makes sense is 1 is 4/4, or 1 is 4 times 1 fourths, right? 1 is the same thing as 4/4, and then you have three more fourths, so 4/4 plus 3/4 will give you 7/4. So that's the same thing as 1 and 3/4. Now, let's do 7 and 1/5. Same exact process. We're going to still be talking in terms of fifths. That's going to be the denominator. You take 5 times 7, because think about it. 7 is the same thing as 35/5. So you take 5 times 7 plus this numerator right here."
Math,"So 7 is 35/5, then you have one more fifth, so you're going to have 35 plus 1, which is equal to 36/5. So this product is the exact same thing as taking the product of 7/4 times 36/5. And we could multiply it out right now. Take the 7 times 36 as our new numerator, 4 times 5 as our new denominator, but that'll give us large numbers. I can't multiply 7 and 36 in my head, or I can't do it too easily. So let's see if we can simplify this first."
Math,"Both our numerator and our denominator have numbers that are divisible by 4, so let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4. So in the numerator, we can divide the 36 by 4 and get 9. If you divide something in the numerator by 4, you need to divide something in the denominator by 4, and the 4 is the obvious guy, so 4 divided by 4 is 1. So now this becomes 7 times 9, and what's the 7 times 9? It's 63, over 1 times 5."
Math,"So now we have our answer as an improper fraction, but they want it as a mixed number or as a mixed fraction. So what are 63/5? So to figure that out-- let me pick a nice color here-- we take 5 into 63. 5 goes into 6 one time. 1 times 5 is 5. You subtract. 6 minus 5 is 1. Bring down the 3. 5 goes into 13 two times. And you could have immediately said 5 goes into 63 twelve times, but this way, at least to me, it's a little bit more obvious. And then 2 times 5 is 12, and then we have sorry! 2 times 5 is 10."
Math,"That tells you not to switch gears in the middle of a math problem. 2 times 5 is 10, and then you subtract, and you have a remainder of 3. So 63/5 is the same thing as 12 wholes and 3 left over, or 3/5 left over. And if you wanted to go back from this to that, just think: 12 is the same thing as 60 fifths, or 60/5. 60/5 plus 3/5 is 63/5, so these two things are the same thing. These two things are equivalent. This is as an improper fraction. This is as a mixed number or a mixed fraction."
Math,But this is our answer right there: 12 and 3/5..
Math,"We're just going to multiply these two dimensions. And so the width is seven-eighths of a meter. So it's going to be seven-eighths of a meter times the height, times the height which is five-ninths of a meter. Times five-ninths of a meter. And what's that going to get us? Well, that's just going to be equal to the meters times the meters give us square meters, so meters squared. We could write it like that."
Math,"And then we're going have, and then we're going to have seven times, this in a new color, we're going to have seven times five in the numerator to get us 35, and then in the denominator, in the denominator we are going to have eight times nine to give us 72. And we'd be done. This is the area of this rectangle here. It's 35-72nds of a square meter. What I want to do now is think a little bit deeper about why that actually makes sense. Or just really another way of thinking about it."
Math,"And to do that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to split this region into equal rectangles. So let's split it into equal rectangles. And we see that we have seven, if we go in the horizontal direction we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or you could say in each row we have seven of these rectangles. In each column you have one, two, three, four, five of these rectangles. So you can see we have five times one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So we have five times seven of these rectangles."
Math,"So, we have--so 35, we have 35 rectangles. I'll just write this, 35 rectangles. And what's the area of each of those rectangles? Well, if this is seven-eighths meters wide, and this is divided into seven equal sections in the horizontal direction, that means that each of these is exactly one-eighth of a meter wide."
Math,"And by that same logic, each of these, if this whole thing is five-ninths, and the height of each of these is one-fifth because we have five rectangles per column, then the height of each of these is going to be one-ninth of a meter. So what's the area of just this character right over here? Well, it's going to be one-ninth of a meter times one-eighth of a meter."
Math,"So this area, this area right over there is just going to be one-ninth of a meter times one-eighth of a meter which is equal to one times one is one, nine times eight is 72, and meters times meters is square meters. So the area of each of these 35 is one-72nd of a square meter. So, if I say 35, so the area of all of them combined is going to be 35 times the area of each of them. 35 times one-72nd of a square meter. And what's that going to be? Well, that's going to be exactly what we got up here."
Math,"35 times one-72nd of a square meter is going to be 35, 35-72nds of a square meter. And this 35 is the same one that we had in yellow. That's this one right over there. So once again, you can just multiply five-ninths times seven-eighths to get what we have got here. But hopefully when we thought about the area of each of these rectangles, it might make a little bit more intuitive sense where this number came from.."
Math,"And let's say its width is also one meter. So I'm talking about the dimensions of the entire square, not just the shaded region. So this is also, that right over there is also one meter. What's the area of the entire square going to be, not just the shaded, the entire square? Well, the total area, total area is going to be equal to the height times the width. So one meter times one meter."
Math,"One times one is of course one and meters times meters we could write that as a square meter or meter squared, however you want to think about it. Now with that out of the way now let's focus on the shaded area. Let's think about what that is. So the shaded, shaded, shaded area is equal to what, and I encourage you to pause the video and try to figure that out. Well the one thing that might jump out of you is that our entire area, our entire square is divided into these equally equal, equal rectangles."
Math,"So one way to think about it is well, what is the area of each of these equal rectangles? For example what is the area of that rectangle right over there? And to figure it out we can say well, what fraction is that of the whole? And to figure that out we have to figure out how many of these rectangles has our whole been divided into? We could try to count them out or we could say let's see, I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 columns, and each columns has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
Math,"So we have 10 columns of seven or we have 70 of these rectangles, that our entire whole is divided into 70 equal sections that we see these rectangles right over here. This character, this character right over there that is 1/70 of the entire area. So 1/70 of one square meter which is of course just going to be 1/70 of a square meter. That's just one of these. That's just one of these rectangles."
Math,"Now if we cared about the shaded area we can just count how many of these rectangles there are and we see that there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine columns of one, two, three. So there's 27 of these rectangles, of these equal rectangles in the shaded area. The shaded area is going to be, we have 27 of these rectangles and each of them, and then each of them have an area of 1/70 of a square meter."
Math,"1/70 of a square meter and what does that give us? Well that gives us the area of the shaded or the shaded area is going to be 27/70. 27 times 1/70 is going to be 27/70. 27/70 square meters and we're done. But what I want to appreciate now is that there's multiple ways that we could have tackled this. Another way we could have tackled it is to figure out what the dimensions, what the dimensions are of the shaded area. So for example."
Math,"For example, what is the height of just the shaded area? So just that height right over there and I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about what it is and it's going to be a fraction. Well, we see if we're going in the vertical direction we've divided this one meter. We've divided it into one, two, three, four, five. So let me do it a little bit differently. We've divided it into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven equal sections."
Math,"That might have been a little bit confusing the way I just drew it. So you can see it when you look at the actual... Actually let me do it in a more vibrant color. We have... I'm having trouble picking colors. All right, here we go. We have one, that's that right over there. Two, three, four, five, six, seven equal sections that we've divided this one meter in. And the height of the shaded area is three of them."
Math,"So this height right over here, this height right over here is 3/7 of the whole and the whole is a meter. So it's 3/7 of a meter. Now by that same logic what is the width going to be? What is the width going to be? Well we can see that the entire meter has been divided into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 equal sections so going from here to here is going to be a tenth. So this distance right over here is going to be a tenth. Let me do that in a color that's different."
Math,"So this distance right over here is going to be a tenth and so how many tenths represent the width of the green area? Let's see, we get, have 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, 4/10, 5/10, 6/10, 7/10, 8/10, 9/10. So this width is 9/10 of this whole length which is a meter so it's 9/10 of a meter. Now to find the area we can multiply the width times the height or the height times the width. So we could say, so I'll write this again. The shaded area."
Math,"Shaded area instead of doing it this way we could say I have a height of 3/7 of a meter. So 3/7 meters and then I can multiply that, times our width for just the shaded area which is 9/10 of a meter. 9/10 of a meter. And now what is this going to get us? Well, this is going to be equal to the meters times the meters is going to get square meters which is what we want and then we could multiple the numerators and multiply the denominators."
Math,"Three times nine is going to give us 27 and seven times 10 is going to give us 70. Exactly what we had before. 27/70 square. Let me write that a little bit neater. of a square meter. And you could think about why did this work out regardless of how we did it? Notice, three and nine are the numerators. That was how many rows and columns we had of these little rectangles. And then the seven and 10 that's to figure out how many rectangles we actually had."
Math,"So this is saying okay, the three times nine is how many rectangles we have? And then the seven times 10 is what fraction of the whole each of those rectangles represent and that's essentially what we did up here. So either way, you're going to get the right answer but I really want you to think about why this was.."
Math,"So you want 1/2 of 3/4. So you just multiply 1/2 times 3/4, and this is equal to-- you multiply the numerators. 1 times 3 is 3. 2 times 4 is 8. And we're done! You need 3/8 of a cup of old-fashioned oats. And let's visualize that a little bit, just so it makes a little bit more sense. Let me draw what 3/4 looks like, or essentially how much oats you would need in a normal situation, or if you're doing the whole recipe. So let me draw."
Math,"Let's say this represents a whole cup, and if we put it into fourths-- let me divide it a little bit better. So if we put it into fourths, 3/4 would represent three of these, so it would represent one, two, three. It would represent that many oats. Now, you want half of this, right? Because you're going to make half of the recipe. So we can just split this in half. Let me do this with a new color."
Math,"So you would normally use this orange amount of oats, but we're going to do half the recipe, so you'd want half as many oats. So you would want this many oats. Now, let's think about what that is relative to a whole cup. Well, one way we can do it is to turn each of these four buckets, or these four pieces, or these four sections of a cup into eight sections of a cup. Let's see what happens when we do that. So we're essentially turning each piece, each fourth, into two pieces."
Math,"So let's divide each of them into two. So this is the first piece. We're going to divide it into two right there, so now it is two pieces. And then this is the second piece right here. We divide it into one piece and then two pieces. This is the third piece, so we divide it into one, two pieces, and this is the fourth piece, or the fourth section, and we divide it into two sections."
Math,"Now, what is this as a fraction of the whole? Well, we have eight pieces now, right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, because we turned each of the four, we split them again into eight, so we have 8 as the denominator, and we took half of the 3/4, right? Remember, 3/4 was in orange. Let me make this very clear because this drawing can get confusing. This was 3/4 right there. So that is 3/4. This area in this purple color is 1/2 of the 3/4. But let's think about it in terms of the eights."
Math,"How many of these sections of eight is it? Well, you have one section of eight here, two sections of eight there, three sections of eight, so it is 3/8. So hopefully that makes some sense or gives you a more tangible feel for what it means when you take 1/2 of 3/4.."
Math,"But let's focus on the question. So you can ride your bike 1/5 of a mile per minute. And you're going to do this for 3 and 1/3 minutes-- times 3 and 1/3. So we really have to figure out, how do we multiply 1/5 times 3 and 1/3? So there's a couple of ways to think about it. You could literally view a 3 and 1/3 as this is the same thing as 1/5 times 3 plus 1/3. That's exactly what 3 and 1/3 is. And then we can just apply the distributive property."
Math,"This would be 1/5 times 3-- I'm going to keep the colors the same-- plus 1/5 times 1/3. And this is going to be equal to-- well, we could rewrite 1/5 times 3 as 1/5 times 3/1. That's what 3 really is if we wrote it as a fraction. And then, of course, we're going to have plus 1/5 times 1/3. And let's just think about what each of these evaluate to. Here you multiplied the numerators, and you multiplied the denominators. So this is going to be equal to 1 times 3 over 5 times 1."
Math,"And this business right over here is going to be-- and remember, order of operations. We want to do our multiplication first. So this is going to be 1 times 1 over 5 times 3. And so that's going to be equal to 3/5 plus 1/15. And now we have different denominators here. But lucky for us, 3/5, if we multiplied the numerator and the denominator by 3, we're going to get a denominator of 15. And so that's equal to 9/15 plus 1/15, which equals 10/15."
Math,"And if you divide the numerator and the denominator both by 5, you're going to get 2/3. So your friend lives 2/3 miles away from your house. Well, that's kind of interesting. And this was kind of a long way to do it. Let's think about if there's a simpler way to do it. So this is the same thing as 1/5 times-- and I'm just going to write 3 and 1/3 as a mixed number. So it's 1/5 times 3 and 1/3 can be rewritten as 9/3-- sorry, I'm going to rewrite 3 and 1/3 as an improper fraction."
Math,"So this is the same thing as 9/3-- that's 3-- plus 1/3, which is the same thing as 1/5-- well, I switched colors arbitrarily-- which is the same thing-- I'm still on the same color-- as 1/5 times 9/3 plus 1/3 is 10/3. And now we can just multiply the numerator and multiply the denominator-- or multiply the numerators. So this is 1 times 10-- I'm trying to stay good with the color coding-- over 5 times 3, which is exactly equal to what we just got. 1 times 10 is equal to 10. 5 times 3 is 15."
Math,"10/15, we already established, is the same thing as 2/3. So your friend lives 2/3 of a mile away from you.."
Math,"So that is one group of 2, two groups of 2, three groups of 2, and four groups of 2. And we learned many, many videos ago that this, of course, is going to be equal to 8. Well, we could express a very similar idea with division. We could start with 8 things. So let's start with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight things. So now we're going to start with the 8. And we could say, well, let's try to divide that into four groups, four equal groups."
Math,"Well, that's one equal group, two equal groups, three equal groups, and four equal groups. And we see when we start with 8 divide it into four equal groups, each group is going to have 2 objects in it. So you probably see the relationship. 2 times 4 is 8. 8 divided by 4 is 2. And actually, if we did 8 divided by 2, we would get 4. And this is generally true."
Math,"If I have something times something else is equal to whatever their product is, if you take the product and divide by one of those two numbers, you'll get the other one. And that idea applies to fractions. It actually makes a lot of sense with fractions. So for example, let's say that we started off with 1/3 and we wanted to multiply that times 3. Well, there's a couple of ways we could visualize it. Actually, let me just draw a diagram here."
Math,"So let's say that this block represents a whole, and let me shade in a 1/3 of it. So that's 1/3. We're going to multiply by 3. So we're going to have 3 of these 1/3's. Or another way of thinking about it, it's going to be 1/3 plus another 1/3 plus another 1/3. That's our first 1/3, our second 1/3, and our third 1/3. And we get the whole. This is 3/3, or 1. So this is going to be equal to 1. So you use the exact same idea."
Math,"If 1/3 times 3 is equal to 1, then that means that 1 divided by 3 must be equal to 1/3. And this comes straight out of how we first even thought about fractions. The first way that we ever thought about fractions was, well, let's start with a whole. And that whole would be our 1. And let's divide it into 3 equal sections, the same way that we divided this 8 into 4 equal groups. So if you divide this into 3 equal sections, the size of each of those sections is going to be exactly 1/3."
Math,"Now, this leads to an interesting question that might be popping in your brain. Notice, we have 1 is the numerator, 3 is the denominator, and we just said that this is equal to the numerator divided by the denominator. 1 over 3 is the same thing as 1 divided by 3. Is this always true for a fraction? Well, let's just do the same thought experiment, but let's do it with a different fraction. Let's take 3/4 and multiply it by 4. So multiply it by 4. So once again, let's see if I could draw 1/4 here."
Math,"Let me do this in a new color. So let's say that this block right over here is a whole. We'll divide it into four equal sections. So now I've divided it into fourths. And let me copy and paste it so I can use it multiple times. So copy. All right. Now, 3/4, that's going to be-- we can assume-- I didn't draw it perfectly. Actually, I could draw it a little bit better than that just to make the four equal sections actually look equal. So that looks like a little bit better of a job."
Math,"I'm trying to make them four equal sections. Let me copy that one. So let me use it for later. Now, 3/4. This is four equal sections, and 3/4 represents three of them-- one, two, three. But now we're going to multiply it by 4. So we're going to have 3/4 four times. So we're going to need some more wholes here. So let's throw in another whole. So this is one 3/4. Now let me do the next 3/4 in another color. So that's a 1/4, that's a second 1/4, that's a third 1/4. That's another 3/4."
Math,"And now let's do-- so we've done two 3/4 just now. Let me make it clear. This is the first 3/4, and then this plus this is the second 3/4. Now let's do a third 3/4. And we're going to have to use another whole right over here. And I will do that in this color. So my third 3/4, so here's a 1/4, here's my second 1/4, here's a third 1/4. So in green, I have another 3/4. And now we need four 3/4. So let's do that in a color I have not used yet, maybe white."
Math,"So that's a 1/4, that's two 1/4, and that is three 1/4. So notice, now I have now I have one 3/4, two 3/4, three 3/4, and four 3/4. And what did I do when I got those four 3/4? Well, it's pretty clear. This is turned into 3 wholes. So this is equal to 3 wholes. Well, if 3/4 times 4 is equal to 3, that means that 3 divided by 4 is equal to 3/4. So the same idea again. 3 over 4 is the same thing as 3 divided by 4. And in general, this is true. The fraction symbol here can be interpreted as division."
Math,"And looking at this diagram right here, it made complete sense. If you started with 3 wholes, and you want to divide it into 4 equal groups, one group, two groups, three groups, four groups, each group is going to have 3/4 in it.."
Math,"How do we share these 3 bars of soap so that we each get to experience all of the smells? So this might be a nice rose smell. This might be some type of ivory smell. I don't even know if that's a legitimate smell. This might be some type of sandalwood, which is always very nice. And my wife has an idea. She says, look I'm going to take these 3 bars, so we're starting with 3 bars of soap. And I'm going to divide it into 2 equal groups."
Math,"And I said, how are you going to do that? And she says, well, I'm just going to take out some type of carving saw or carving knife, or who knows what it is, and I'm just going to cut it right down the middle, so right down this. This is my wife cutting the soap right over here with her saw. So she's cutting the soap right over here. So she has divided the soap into 2 equal groups. So she's taken 3 bars, and she's divided into 2 equal groups."
Math,"So the interesting question here is, how many bars of soap do we each have now? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about that for a second. How many bars of soap do we each have now? Well, let's just visualize my share. Let's say I take this bottom half right over here. So this is Sal's share of the soap. Let me write this out. So this is Sal's share. My wife took this top half. Well, what do I have? Well, I have 1/2, I have another 1/2, and I have another 1/2 of a bar."
Math,"So I have 3/2 bars of soap. Or you could say that I have 3 times 1/2 bars of soap. Notice, something very interesting happened here. 3 divided by 2 is equal to 3 times 1/2. And we could make it even more interesting, because we know 2 is the exact same thing as 2/1. So 3 divided by 2/1 is equal to 3 times 1/2. Notice we went from a division to a multiplication, and we took the reciprocal. And that makes complete sense. We have 3/2 bars now. But what's 3 times 1/2? Well, 3 times 1/2 is equal to 3/2."
Math,"So just doing this little simple, smelly soap example, we've got a very interesting result. 3 divided by 2 is the same thing as 3 times 1/2, which is the same thing as 3/2.."
Math,"And this leads to all sorts of interesting conclusions, some of which we've already seen, and some of which are a little bit new. So, for example, if I had the fraction 7/7, this can be interpreted now as 7 divided by 7, as our numerator divided by our denominator. And 7 divided by 7 is of course equal to 1. And this is consistent with what we've already seen. 7/7 would get us to a whole, and a whole is the exact same thing as one. But we could do things a little bit more interesting as well."
Math,"We could take something like 18/6 and realize, wow. This is the same thing as 18 divided by 6, which we know is equal to 3. And we should do a little reality check. Does this make sense, that 18/6 should be equal to 3? Well, we could rewrite it. We could rewrite 18/6. Let me make the sixths that same orange color. That's going to be the same thing. 18 is 6 plus 6 plus 6. And then all of that over 6, and then that's the same thing. That's the same thing as 6/6 plus 6/6 plus 6/6."
Math,"And I could make this right over here in orange. And we've already seen, or we've seen many, many videos ago, that 6/6, just like 7/7, these are each equal to a whole. These are each equal to 1. And we can now view this as 6 divided by 6, which is the same thing as 1. So this is 1 plus 1 plus 1, which is, of course, equal But this starts to raise an interesting question. This all worked out just fine because 18 is a multiple of 6. 6 divides evenly into 18."
Math,"But what happens if we start having fractions where the denominator does not divide evenly into the numerator? Let's say we have a fraction like 23 over 6. Well, we know that we can interpret this as 23 divided by 6. And if we actually divide 23 by 6-- let's do that. So we divide 6 into 23. We know 6 goes into 23 three times. 3 times 6 is 18. And then when you subtract, you end up with a remainder of 5. So we might say, hey, 23 divided by 6 is equal to 5 remainder 3. But that's not that satisfying."
Math,"What do I do with this remainder? This really isn't a number here. This is just saying that we're going five times, and then we have a little bit left over. What we can do now is manipulate this a little bit so that we can realize that this is a number, and in particular, a mixed number. So for example, we could start with a 23 over 6, and we could divide it into-- or we could decompose the numerator into one part that is divisible by 6, evenly divisible by 6, and the remainder."
Math,"So for example, 23 over 6 we can rewrite as 18 plus 5 over 6. Notice I decomposed the 23 into one part that is a multiple of 6, and it's the largest multiple that essentially fits into 23, or that is less than or equal to 23, and then the remainder. When you divide 6 into 23, you get a remainder of 5. You could view it as, I divided it into the remainder and everything else. And the reason why this is interesting is because we know that this is going to be equal to 18 over 6 plus 5 over 6."
Math,"Well, we already know that 18/6 is the same thing as 18 divided by 6, or 3. So this is the same thing as 3. So we know that 23 over 6, which is the same thing as 18 plus 5 over 6, is the same thing as 3 plus 5/6. Or, if we want to write it as a mixed number, we could write it as 3 and 5/6.."
Math,"Or you could say something like this, that 18 divided by, divided by six is equal to three. Now we're just going to extend this same relationship between multiplication and division to expressions that deal with fractions."
Math,"So for example, if I were to tell you that 1/4 divided by, and I'm going to color-code it, divided by two is equal to 1/8, is equal to 1/8, how could we express this relationship, but using multiplication? Well, if 1/4 divided by two is equal to 1/8, that means that 1/8 times two is equal to 1/4. Let me write this down, or I could write it like this. I could write that 1/4 is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to 1/8 times two, times two. And we could do another example."
Math,"Let's say that I were to walk up to you on the street and I were to tell you that, hey, you, 42 is equal to seven, seven divided by 1/6. In the future, we will learn to compute things like this. But just based on what you see here, how could we express this same relationship between 42, seven, and 1/6, but express it with multiplication? Pause this video, and think about that. Well, if 42 is equal to seven divided by 1/6, that means that 42 times 1/6 is equal to seven. Let me write that down."
Math,"This is the same relationship as saying that 42 times 1/6 is equal to seven. Now let's say I walk up to you on the street and I were to say, all right, you, I'm telling you that 1/4 divided by, divided by six is equal to some number that we will express as t. So can we rewrite this relationship between 1/4, six, and t, but instead of using division, use multiplication? Pause this video, and try to think about it."
Math,"So if 1/4 divided by six is equal to t, based on all of the examples we've just seen, that means that if we were to take t times six, we would get 1/4. So we could write it this way, t times six, times six is going to be equal to 1/4. If this isn't making sense, I really want you to think about how this relationship is really just the same relationship we saw up here."
Math,"The only new thing here is instead of always having whole numbers, we're having fractions and representing some of the numbers with letters.."
Math,"In fact, they divide all of the sevenths into four equal sections, and so 1/7, which is this whole green bar divided by four, well what would be this fraction of the whole that is in a question mark. Can you pause this video and figure out what fraction of the whole is this question mark? When we divided the first seventh into four equal sections, we also divided all of the sevenths into four equal sections, and so now the entire whole is 28 equal sections because you have a four by seven grid."
Math,"You have one, two, three, four rows and you still have your seven columns, and you can count them, seven, 14, 21, 28, and so 1/7 divided by four is going to be one of these 28 sections. This right over here is one over 28. This is 1/28. Let's do another example. We're told use the number line below to help visualize 1/5 being divided by three."
Math,"As we go from zero to one on the number line, you can divide it into five equal sections where that's 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, and of course 5/5 is equal to one, but we want 1/5 divided by three, so we took the section from zero to 1/5 and we divided it into three equal sections, and so the first of those sections, this one right over here, that would be 1/5 divided by three. What is this going to be equal to? Pause this video again and see if you can figure that out."
Math,"The key realization is when we divided each of the fifths into three more equal sections, we can now think of each of these steps as a fifteenth because now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 equal sections between zero and one, and where did that 15 come from? We had five equal sections and then we split each of those five into three more equal sections so five times three is 15."
Math,"This right over here is 1/15, this is 2/15, this is 3/15, which is equivalent to 1/5 and we can keep going on and on and on, but the key realization here is if I take that first 1/5 and if I divide it into three equal sections and I go only as far as that first of the three equal sections, that is going to be 1/15, 1/15 and we are done.."
Math,Pause this video and try to do that. I always try to work through it together and to help us as I promised or I suggested I guess. We said let's draw 1/3. I will represent a whole by that square right over there. And now let me split up into three equal sections. So this is all hand drawn with the aid of a computer. So it's not going to be perfect. But let's say that that is three equal sections. It's roughly three equal sections. I didn't do it perfectly but you hopefully get the idea.
Math,"And so 1/3 would be one of those three equal sections. So that's a third right over there that I have just shaded in and I want to divide it into five. I want to divide it by five, I should say. So let's do that. So to divide it by five, I'm gonna divide it into five equal sections. And if I'm dividing that one into five equal sections, let me just divide all of the thirds into five equal sections. I'm essentially just going to make five rows here."
Math,"One, and I'm gonna eyeball it, so it's going to be approximate. Two, three, and then four and five equal sections. I now split this whole into one, two, three, four, five rows of equal height. Now if I go to my original third and I divide it by five, I would be left with this right over here. But what fraction is this of the whole? Well what I've done now is I've split my whole into 15 equal sections. How do I know that? Well I could count them."
Math,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Or you could just say look I had one, two, three thirds and now each of those have been split into one, two, three, four, five equal sections. So three times five is 15. So each of these is a 15th and so the 1/3 divided by five is just one of those 15ths. So that right over there is one of those 15ths. So this is going to be equal to 1/15 and we are done.."
Math,"So here on this number line we go from zero to five, and then notice they've divided into pieces that are each a half of a whole. This is one piece right over here. So how many of those halves, so this right over here is one half, how many of those halves does it take to make five? Well, two halves make a whole, and we have five wholes. So it's going to be five times two, or 10. And we see that right over here. One half, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 halves make five wholes."
Math,"So this is going to be equal to 10. So five divided into pieces of one half, or five wholes divided into pieces of one half would be equal to 10 pieces. Let's do another example. So we have a similar question here. Here we're asked, ""If three wholes are divided into pieces that are each 1/6 of a whole, how many pieces are there?"" Once again, pause this video and think about it. Well, they really help us out with this visual because we have three wholes."
Math,"This is one whole, two whole, and then three wholes, and then we have divided them into pieces that are each 1/6 of a whole. This is a sixth right over here, this is a sixth right over here, so each of these are sixths. And so, if we look at this, we have six sixths in a whole, and so in three wholes we're gonna have six, 12, 18 pieces. And you could literally just count these up. But it makes sense."
Math,"If you take three wholes and you divide it into sixths, so this is a sixth right over here, each of these wholes are going to be six sixths, so three wholes are going to be three times six sixths, or 18 sixths. There you go.."
Math,"Alright now lets work through this together. Now let me draw three wholes. And so lets say this is... I'm gonna hand draw it, so its not gonna be perfect. But lets say that is one whole right over there. This is two wholes right over there. And then I have my third whole just like that. And now I'm going to divide it into pieces or sections that are each one fourth of a whole. So this first whole is four pieces that are each one fourth each, of four fourths."
Math,"And then I have another four fourths right over here. And then I have another four fourths right over here. Another way to think about it, I took the three wholes, and I divided it into fourths. So if you divide it into fourths how many pieces am I going to have? Well this is pretty straight forward, you have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten 11 12 pieces. And I didn't even have to count that, each whole is gonna be four fourths."
Math,"So three wholes is going to be three times four fourths, or 12 pieces or 12 sections. So that is going to be equal to 12. Another way to think about it is if you take three and you divide it into equal sections that are each a fourth you are going to have 12 equal sections.."
Math,"All right, the way I think about it is there's some distance that they're going to try to travel. So in this case, it's half of a mile and they're going to divide that distance amongst the three friends. And so the distance that each of them are going to run is the total distance divided by the number of folks that are running. So an expression that represents this is 1/2, the total distance they're running, divided by the number of people who are going to split that distance, divided by three."
Math,"And so that is choice C right over here. Now it might have confused you a little because you're not used to dividing a smaller number, especially a fraction, by a lager number but that's exactly what's going on over here. You're taking the total distance and it's being split amongst three friends. So the total distance divided by three friends will tell you how far each of them has to run. Let's do another example."
Math,"So here, we are, actually they're telling us that there's some problem that can be solved with 1/2 divided by seven. They say which problem can we solve with 1/2 divided by seven? And then they give us three different scenarios that we could try to solve. So pause this video and think of which of these three scenarios can be solved with this expression. All right, let's go through each of the choices. Cara ordered seven pizzas for her birthday party. Her parents ate 1/2 of a pizza before the party."
Math,"How much pizza is left for the party? All right, so what's going on here? She started with seven pizzas, she starts with seven. Her parents ate 1/2 of a pizza. So 1/2 of a pizza is taken away. And so that would tell you how much is left. So this is definitely, this is the expression you would solve to figure out A, not this expression up here. So I would rule this out. Walt has seven hamsters. Each hamster weighs 1/2 of a kilogram."
Math,"What is the total weight of the hamsters? Well to figure out the total weight, you would start with the number of hamsters and you would multiply that times the weight of each hamster. So that would be seven times 1/2, so we could rule that one out. So it's likely going to be C but let's figure this, let's make sure it makes sense. Jenae has 1/2 kilogram of trail mix. She splits her trail mix evenly between seven friends."
Math,"How much trail mix will each friend get? All right, she has a total amount, 1/2 of a kilogram and she's going to divide that total amount, she splits her trail mix evenly between seven friends so she's going to take this 1/2 and split it evenly amongst seven friends to get a certain amount per friend. How much trail mix will each friend get? And that's exactly what that expression up there is so I am liking this choice.."
Math,"All right, now let's work through this together. So Billy starts with 1/4 of a pound of trail mix. So how can we represent 1/4? Well, if this is a whole pound, let's just imagine this rectangle is a whole pound, I could divide it into four equal sections. So let's see, this would be roughly two equal sections, and then if I were to divide each of those into two, now I have four equal sections. So Billy is starting with 1/4 of a pound. Draw a little bit, try to make it a little bit more equal."
Math,"Billy is starting with 1/4 of a pound, so let's say that is that 1/4 of a pound that he starts with. He's starting with 1/4 of a pound, and he wants to share it equally between himself and his brother. So he wants to share it equally between two people right over here. So what we wanna do is essentially say, let's start with our total amount of trail mix, and then we're going to divide it into two equal shares."
Math,"So when they ask us how much trail mix would they each get, we're really trying to figure out what is this 1/4 divided by two? So what would that be? Well, what if we were to take all of these four equal sections and divide them into two? So I'll divide that one into two. I will divide this one into two. I will divide this one into two, and then I would divide this one into two. And now what are each of these sections? Well, each of these are now 1/8."
Math,"That's a 1/8 right over there, the whole is divided into eight equal sections. And so you can see, that when you start with that 1/4, and you divide it into two equal sections, so one section and two equal sections right over there, each of these is equal to 1/8. So 1/4 divided by two is equal to 1/8. Let's do another example. So we are told Matt is filling containers of rice. Each container holds 1/4 of a kilogram of rice."
Math,"And then they tell us if Matt has three kilograms of rice, how many containers can he fill? So like always, pause this video, and see if you can figure that out. All right, so let's think about what's going on. We're starting with a total amount, three kilograms of rice, and we're trying to divide it into equal sections. In this case we're trying to divide it into equal sections of 1/4 of a kilogram. So we are trying to figure out what three divided by 1/4 is going to be equal to."
Math,"Now to imagine that, let's imagine three wholes, this would be three whole kilograms. So that is one whole, this is two wholes, trying to make them all the same, but it's hand-drawn, so it's not as exact as I would like. So that's three whole kilograms here. And he wants to divide it into sections of 1/4. So if you divide it into fourths, how many fourths are you going to have? Well, let's do that. So let's see, if we were to divide it into halves, it would look like this."
Math,"If you divide these three wholes into halves. But then if you want to divide it into fourths, it would look like this, I'm trying to get it as close to equal sections. They should be exactly equal sections. So I am almost there. So there you have it. So I've just taken three wholes and I've divided it into fourths. So how many fourths are there? Well, there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 fourths. So three divided by 1/4 is equal to 12."
Math,"And I encourage you to really think about why this is the case, that if we take a whole number like three and you divide it by 1/4, we're getting a value larger than three. And we're getting a value that is four times three. Think about why that is the case.."
Math,"as being roughly equal to, or some people might say, as approximately equal to. Well let's see, 2.7, that's two ones and seven tenths. So we could think about well what's the nearest whole number to 2.7? And so 2.7 is pretty close to 3, it's in fact closer to 3 than it is to 2. So we could say that this is roughly equal to three times four. And then three times four is, of course, equal to 12. And you can see that these other answers actually seem quite unreasonable."
Math,"1.2, if I take something and I multiply times four, I shouldn't get an answer that is less than my original something. And then to go from, and then to take something that's roughly equal to three times four to get to 120, that doesn't make sense, and definitely doesn't make sense to get to 1,200. Let's do another example. So here we said what is roughly equal to 78 times 19.88. So pause this video and try to answer that. Alright, well this is really the same idea."
Math,"We wanna think about, well what are numbers that these numbers are close to that are easy to multiply with. So for example, 78, that is pretty close to 80 and then 19.88, or 19 and 88 hundredths, that's pretty close to 20. It's closer to 20 than it is to 19 and even if it was closer to 19, just to estimate I probably would still go to 20 because it's easier to multiply with 20. So this is going to be pretty close to 20. So all of this is going to be roughly equal to 80 times 20."
Math,"And you might already recognize that this is going to be 8 times 2 times 10 times 10 and I could write it that way, no reason for me to skip steps. But you would normally do this in your head. So 80 is the same thing as 8 times 10, we do that in that purple color so that you can see it. So this is the same thing as 8 times 10 times two times ten which we could then write this is going to be 8 times 2 which is 16, so the 8 and the 2, you get 16 times 10 times 10 is times 100 so this should be 1,600."
Math,"1,600 which is this choice right over here. And it's always good to just do reality check to make sure it's reasonable. It wouldn't make any sense if I take a number close to 80 and I multiply it by some number that's close to 20 and get a smaller number than 80. It also, if you have a number that's close to 80, to get 160 you'd only have to multiply it by roughly 2. But here we're multiplying by roughly 20."
Math,"And then to go to 80, or roughly 80, to 16,000, well then you wouldn't have to multiply by something that's close to 20, you'd have to multiply by something that's close to 200. So I like our answer.."
Math,"It's representing something times three tenths. So pause the video and try to think about that. Well, let's see. We are going one times three tenths, two times three tenths, three times three tenths, and then four times three tenths."
Math,"So what's represented here is four times three tenths, and so what is this going to be equal to? Well you can see you go from three tenths, to six tenths, to nine tenths, and then you could view this as twelve tenths, but twelve tenths is the same thing as one, one and two tenths. So you could view this as 1.2. One and two tenths. Let's do another example. No, actually I'll do it on the same number line."
Math,"If we wanted to represent three times 0.2 What would that look like on this number line? And what would this be equal to? So I'll put a little equal sign here. Pause this video and see if you an figure that out. All right, so let's think about where two tenths is this is one tenth, two tenths is right over there. This is 0.2, and we're gonna multiply it times three."
Math,"So, we're gonna multiply it times one, then we're gonna multiply it times two, that takes us to four tenths and then we're gonna multiply it times three to get us to six tenths, 0.6. So it's six tenths just like that. Now you could also visualize two tenths as parts of a whole. So for example, this represents two tenths. I have this whole, this square is a whole it's split into ten equal columns here and we have two of them filled in. So this represents two tenths."
Math,"So if you have three times two tenths, Well this is one times two tenths, this is two times two tenths, and this is three times two tenths. And so how many tenths do we now have? Well we have one, two, three, four, five, six tenths. Which is exactly what we have here, six tenths. Let's do one more example, that gets a little bit more involved. So here we're told to multiply. It says you many use the models shown to help find the product. And this is a screen shot from the exercise on Khan Academy."
Math,"So pause this video and see if you can figure out what this is. All right, so they're saying 52 hundredths times three, and they have 52 hundredths depicted right over here and then they have it depicted three times. So the total number of hundredths depicted here that is 52 hundredths times three, because we have 52 hundredths here, another 52 hundredths, and then another 52 hundredths."
Math,"So how many hundredths is that going to be? Well, you could view this as 52 times three and that will give you the number of hundredths we have. So let's think about this. So if we were to just say 52 times three, well this is going to be two times three is equal to six and then five tens times three is 15 tens, which is the same thing. We either just write it as 15 tens, or that's 100 and five tens. But either way if I have 52 of something and I multiply that by three, I now have 156 of that something."
Math,"And here the something is hundredths. So if I say 52 hundredths times three that's going to be 156 hundredths. And how do we represent 156 hundredths. Well there is a couple of ways to think about it if this is the ones place, this is the tenths place, this is the hundredths place. Well we would write the six there, the five there, and the one there."
Math,"So you could recognize this as hey look, a hundred hundredths, let me color code it, a hundred hundredths is the same thing as a whole and I'll circle that in red, and fifty hundredths is the same thing as five tenths, and of course six hundredths is the same thing as six hundredths. So this is going to be equal to 1.56, or you could view this as 156 hundredths, or you could view this as a whole, which is a hundred hundredths, and five tenths, which is fifty hundredths, and six hundredths.."
Math,"All right, now there's several ways that we could approach what eight times seven tenths is. We could view this as eight times, and we could write seven tenths as a fraction. So we can re-express this as seven tenths, seven over 10 is the same thing as 0.7."
Math,"And we already know how to multiply fractions, you could view this as being equal to, eight is the same thing as eight over one or eight wholes, I guess you could say, times seven over 10, times seven tenths, which is going to be equal to, if we multiply our numerator, we're going to get 56. And if we multiply our denominators, we get tenths. And that makes sense. If I have eight times seven tenths, I end up with 56 tenths."
Math,"Now 56 tenths can also be written as, this is the same thing as 50, plus six over 10, which is the same thing as 50 over 10, plus six over 10. And so this is the same thing as, this is five wholes, so five and six tenths, five and six tenths, which we can write as five and six tenths, or 5.6. And it's always good to do a little bit of a reality check, whenever you get an answer when you're multiplying decimals. Say, okay, seven tenths is a little bit less than one."
Math,"So we would expect this product, if we're multiplying eight times something a little bit less than one, we would expect the product to be a little bit less than eight. So 5.6 makes sense. If for some reason we got, the we you computed something and you were to get 60, you say, well, that doesn't make sense, I should get a value less than eight."
Math,"And similarly, if you somehow got a value or product of like one, you're like, well, that's a lot less than eight, I should get something that is seven tenths of eight. Now, another way that you could approach this is you could view this as the same thing as eight times, and once again, I'm just gonna write this in a different way, eight times seven, eight times seven tenths. So, if you have eight times seven of something, what is that going to be equal to? Well, eight times seven, that's 56."
Math,"So you're going to be, this is going to be equal to 56 tenths, 56 tenths. And one way to think about 56 tenths, 56 tenths is the same thing as 50 tenths, 50, let me color code that differently. So this is going to be the same thing as 50 tenths, 50 tenths, plus six tenths, plus the six tenths, get right tenths, six tenths, and 50 tenths is the same thing as five ones. So five ones, and six tenths, which is exactly what we have here, five ones, and six tenths."
Math,"Let's do another example, that's a little bit more involved. So let's say that we want to figure out, we want to figure out what is three times 0.87. Pause this video and try to figure that out. Well, once again, there's many ways to approach it. But we could just start with the way that we just looked at. We could say, hey, this is the same thing as three times, and we can re-express this as, this is the same thing as 87 hundredths."
Math,"87 hundredths, and so if I have three times 87 of something, what am I going to be left with? Well, this is going to be equal to some number of hundredths, and to figure out that, we just figure out what's three times 87? So 87 times three, seven times three is 21, we regroup that two, becomes two 10s. And then eight times three is 24. And that's really 24 10s plus those other two 10s, so we get 26 10s, which is the same thing as 206 10s, but it's gonna be 261."
Math,"So the three times 87 of something is going to be 261 of that something, and this case something is hundredths. So this is 261 hundredths. So how do we express this as a decimal? Well, there's a couple of ways that you can approach it. You can think about is this is the ones place, this is the tenths place, this is the hundredths place. And so very clearly, 100th here would be one in the hundredths place."
Math,"If you have 60 hundredths, which is what the six represents, 60 hundredths is the same thing as six tenths. And then last but not least, if you have 200 hundredths, that's the same thing as two wholes. Another way to think about it is, you go to the hundredths place, and then you start from there, but you write out 261, one, the 60 hundredths, and then the 200 hundredths, and you get 2.61."
Math,"Now another way that you could have approached this, and we saw this in the last example, is you could say hey, this is going to be the same thing as three times at 87 hundredths. (mumbles) These are all equivalent, but hopefully one of these, or more than one of these register with you of what's really going on. Well, this is going to be the same thing as three wholes, times 87 hundredths, 87 hundredths. And so this is going to be equal to, in the numerator, we have three times 87."
Math,"Three times 87 hundredths, one times 100 is 100. Three times 87 hundredths, well, we already know what three times 87 is, this is equal to 261 hundredths. And you can see 100 goes into 261, two times and you're left with 61 hundredths. So these are all equivalent representations. And just reminder, so it's always good to estimate. And so what you have is you have three times something that's a little bit less than one. So you would expect a value, a little bit less than three."
Math,"And so 2.61 also meets that sniff test, that this seems about right. If for some reason you got 26 or 261, that would be way off or even if you got 0.261, that would also feel way off. So hopefully this is helpful.."
Math,"All right, now let's do this together. Now one way to think about this is you could view 31.2 as a certain number of tenths. And how many tenths would this be? Well, you could view this, 31.2, as 312 tenths. And so, this is the same thing as 312 tenths times 19. And so, what we could do is we could figure out what is 312 of something times 19, or what's 312 times 19. It's gonna be that many tenths, and then we could convert it back to a decimal. I'll also show another strategy, but let's just do that."
Math,"So if we were to just multiply 312 times 19, times 19, this is going to be, let's see, two, obviously, another color. Two times nine is 18. One times nine is nine. Plus one is 10. Three times nine is 27, plus one is 28. If what I just did looks unfamiliar, we have videos that explain how this process works. And then, we go to the tens place, right over here. And so, we'd say one times two is two. One times one is one. One times is three is three. And then we add everything together. We get eight."
Math,"Zero plus two is two. Eight plus one is nine. Two plus three is five. So we get five, nine, two, eight, or 5928. Now that's not going to be the answer here. The answer is going to be 5928 tenths. So this is going to be equal to 5928 tenths. Now, how can we express this as a decimal? Well, we could think of it this way. If that's the decimal, this is the tenths place, this is the ones place, which is the same, this is the same thing as 10 tenths place, which is the ones place."
Math,"This is the tens place, and this is the hundreds place. Well, you have eight tenths. We could put that in the tenths place. You have these 20 tenths. That's the same thing as two ones. You have the 900 tenths. Do that in a different color. 900 tenths is the same thing as nine tens. And then, your 5000 tenths is the same thing as five hundreds. Another way to think about it is we wrote all the places out, and we wrote it in terms of tenths."
Math,"So the eight went there, and then every place to the left of that went to the place to the left of that. So this is going to be 592 and eight tenths. So we could write it like that. 592 and eight tenths. Now another way to approach this is to just think about the digits, not the actual numbers, to figure out, well, the answer will have what digits in it. And then try to estimate to think about where the decimal place should go. So, for example, you could do 312 times 19."
Math,"So since you remove the decimal, do the computation, and say, okay, the answer should have the digits five, nine, two, eight in that order. Now where should I put the decimal in order for that to be a reasonable answer? And that's where estimation comes in. You could say, hey, 31.2 times 19, that's going to be approximately equal to, in fact, if I were to estimate these with numbers that are easy to multiply, that's going to be roughly equal to 30 times 20, which is equal to 600."
Math,"So that tells me that my product here should be roughly equal to 600. And so where would I put the decimal here for it to be roughly equal to 600? So I know the answer has the digits five, nine, two, eight. Where do I put a decimal for it to be roughly equal to 600? Well, if I were to put the decimal there, that's not roughly equal to 600. If I were to put the decimal there, that's not roughly equal to 600. That's close to 60. If I put the decimal there, that's close to six."
Math,"If I wanna be close to 600, I'd have to put the decimal right over there. And so that's also a good way to test the reasonableness of what's going on. This should be roughly equal to 600, if we were to estimate it. And so, we like that our process got an answer that is roughly equal to 600.."
Math,"is approximately equal to what? When you see the squiggly equal sign, that means approximately equal to what. So pause this video, and see if you can figure it out on your own. Alright, so the way that I would think about doing it, even if I was trying to do this in my head at the supermarket or something, I'd say, well, okay, I'd probably need paper to do this properly, but gee, 7.8 is awfully close to eight, and 307 is pretty close to 300, so maybe I can estimate this by multiplying eight times 300."
Math,"Now, this isn't going to be exact, it's definitely going to be off, but it's gonna give me a good sense of roughly what 7.8 times 307 is. So what is eight times 300? Well, eight times three is 24, and so eight times 300 would be 2,400, we got these two more zeros, two more zeros. And so there you have it, and luckily, the people who wrote this question estimated in a very similar way. Two people when they estimate might not get the exact same answer, but in this case, we happen to."
Math,"Let's do another example. So here, we're trying to estimate 99.87 times 19. So pause the video again and see if you can come up with a good estimation."
Math,"Alright, so once again, not easy to do this in your head, but this, 99 and 87/100 is pretty close, let me do this in a new color, this is pretty close to 100 times, and I could multiply 100 times 19, that's actually not so difficult, so for example, I could say 100 times 19 is equal to 1,900, but notice, we don't see that choice here, we could say, look, 1,900 is definitely much closer to 2,000 than any of these other, so that might be a good approximation."
Math,"Now, how did they get 2,000? Well, they rounded both of these numbers, they said, this is approximately 100 times 20. So, it's not that it's the right thing to do, to round this 19 up to 20, if you could do 100 times 19, this is actually gonna give you a slightly more accurate result than doing 100 times 20, but 100 times 20 is even easier to estimate in your head. But either way, the closest choice here, and that's why, I guess, these had to be multiple choice questions, is 2,000."
Math,"Let's do another example. So here, we are asked to multiply 2.21 times 5.1, and we wanna know what it approximately equals, so once again, we are estimating, so pause this video and try to figure it out. Well, we're just gonna do the same thing we did in the last two examples."
Math,"2.21, and, well, first of all, this is hard to do in my head, and so 2.21, well, that's approximately, if I round to the nearest two, or to the nearest one, I should say, this is gonna be two times five, which is equal to 10, so this would be approximately equal to 10, and that is a choice."
Math,"Now, some of you might say, ""Whoa, there's ways to get better estimations ""that you could still do with your head,"" so for example, you could say that this is pretty close to, this is approximate, let me do it over here, this is approximately equal to two times 5.1, this is still pretty straightforward to do in your head, this would be 10.2. And so, but you'd still say that this is by far the closest one. Or you could even say something like, this is approximately equal to 2.2 times five."
Math,"What is this going to be equal to? Well, two times five is 10, and 2/10 times five is another whole, and so this is going to be equal to 11, so all of these might be things that you could estimate that you might be able to do in your head, but the important thing to realize is however you do it, by far, 10 is going to be the closest response to what you're getting at, and 10 would be a very natural estimation if you try to simplify both of these numbers when making that estimate.."
Math,"Alright, now let's work through this together. And in this video, we're gonna explore multiple strategies. In the future, we're going to show you what's called the standard strategy, which you might use a lot, but the strategies we're gonna look at in this video are actually very helpful for understanding what multiplying decimals actually means, how it relates to multiplying fractions, as often the way that people, even people who have a lot of math behind them, how they actually multiply decimals."
Math,"So here, three times 25 hundredths. There's a couple of ways to think about it. One way is to say, hey, this is the same thing as three times, and I'm just gonna write it a different way. 25 hundredths, hundredths. If I have three times 25 of something, what is it going to be? Well, what's three times 25? Let's see. Two times 25 is 50, three times 25 is So it's going to be 75, and I'm multiplying, not just three times 25, I'm multiplying three times 25 hundredths."
Math,"Instead of 25 hundredths, I'm gonna have 75, 75 hundredths. Written out in words, this would be 75 hundredths. How would we write that as a decimal? That is the same thing as this, 75 hundredths. Another way to conceptualize this, to think about what this is, is if we were to write three times, we could write it as a fraction. We could write 25/100. This is another way of writing 25 hundredths. These are all equivalent. What is three times 25/100? Same idea."
Math,"This is going to be equal to, you could say this is 25/100 plus 25/100 plus 25/100. This is going to be 75 hundredths, which once again is 0.75. If you wanted to more formally view it as fraction multiplication, you could view it as 3/1 times 25/100, and you multiply the numerators, you get 75, you multiply the denominators, you get 100. Either way, in all of these situations, you're gonna get 75 hundredths."
Math,"Or, another way to think about it, is hey look, this thing right over here, this 25/100, this is the same thing as 1/4. So you could view this as three times 1/4. In fact, this is a decimal that it's good to recognize that this is the same thing as 1/4. So you could view this as three times 1/4, or 3/4, this is a fourth right here, 1/4 could be viewed as a fourth, so this is going to be equal to 3/4, three over four, All of these are equivalent."
Math,"If someone wanted it written out as a decimal, you could, you might know that 3/4 can be expressed as 75 hundredths, which in general, is a good thing to know. Now let's tackle slightly more complicated examples. Let's say we wanted to figure out, we wanted to figure out what 0.4 let me just do this in a new color, times 0.3 is going to be equal to. Pause the video and see if you can compute this, and I'll give you a hint, see if you can express these as fractions."
Math,"What we have here in white, we could read this as four tenths, and we could write it as a fraction, as 4/10, and we're gonna multiply that by what we have over here. This is three tenths, three tenths, which we could write as a fraction as 3/10, and so you could view this as 4/10 of 3/10 or 3/10 of 4/10, but we're multiplying these fractions, which we've seen before in other videos. What's going to happen? Well, if we multiply the numerator we get 12, or the numerators."
Math,"We multiply the denominators, you get 100. So you get 12 hundredths. If you wanted to write that as a decimal, it would be 0.12, 12 hundredths. You might notice something interesting here, and you'll see this more and more as you learn the standard method. 12 is four times three is 12, but now I have two digits behind the decimal, but notice, I have one digit behind the decimal here, one digit behind the decimal here, for a total of two digits behind the decimal."
Math,"I'm giving you a little bit of a hint about where we're going, but the important thing for this video is to recognize that you can re-express each of these as fractions, and then multiply the fractions to get something expressed in terms of hundredths, and then express that as a decimal.."
Math,"And so we're supposed to choose one of these four right over here. So pause this video, try it on your own before we work through it together. All right, now let's work through it together. So this whole square is a whole, and now let's first think about what's going on with this 3/10. So they've labeled the 3/10 as three of these vertical bars right over here. We could view the 3/10 as these three vertical bars. And then they also have this 7/10, which are seven of these horizontal bars."
Math,"And notice each of those bars are 1/10 of the whole. So we have seven of these horizontal bars. If that doesn't look like seven bars, let me just draw it this way. So that's one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. And of course we see something similar with these vertical bars. That's one, two, and three. Now what's going on here is we're looking at where these bars overlap. And one way to think about that is the overlap is going to be 3/10 times 7/10. You could view this overlap..."
Math,"Let me do this in another color right over here. This overlap right over here. You could view that as 7/10 of the 3/10 or 3/10 of the 7/10 or 7/10 times 3/10. So we immediately know it's going to be either this choice that has 0.3 times 0.7 or this choice that has 0.3 times 0.7. But let's see what this should be. Well, when we look at that overlap, we get 21 of these squares, because we have seven in this direction, three in this direction. I could count them, but we have 21 squares here."
Math,"And each of those squares are what fraction of the whole? Well, each of those squares are now 1/100 of the whole because this is now a 10 by 10 grid, each of those is 1/100. So in the overlap we have 21 of these squares, that's 21/100. So 21/100 is 0.21. That's the same thing as 21/100, which is this choice right there. And we're done.."
Math,"All right, now what you might have realized is all of these expressions deal with the same digits as 52 times 762. They just have the decimal in different places. And so what we can do is, we can say, hey look, the answer is going to have the digits three, nine, six, two, four, in that order. And you could see all of these have the digits three, nine, six, two, four, in that order."
Math,"And then we can estimate what these expressions should be equal to, what the products should be equal to, to think about the decimal. So this first expression, 0.52 times 76.2, the way I think about it is 0.52, that's close to 50/100, that's close to a half, and so 76.2, that's close to 76. And so this first expression, this first product should be roughly half of 76. Half of 76 would be around 38. And so which of these is close to 38? Well this first one is 39.624, so that's actually the closest to 38."
Math,"The second one is 396. And then we have 3,962. So I like this first one, the 39.624. That feels right. Now the second expression, 0.52 times 762. Well once again, 0.52 is roughly equal to 50/100, roughly equal to 5/10, roughly equal to 1/2, and so, and 762, we could say hey, you know, that's, if we wanna be really rough, really, really approximate it, we could say, hey, it's roughly 800. And so this should be about half of 800, so it should be around 400. And so we actually had that choice already there."
Math,"So this would be 396.24. Definitely wouldn't be the the 3,962.4. And so I'm already feeling good that this last choice sits down here. But I can verify it. 5.2, well let's just say that's roughly 5. 762, let's say that's roughly 800. So five times 800, that would be around, that would be 4000. And so we would expect this expression to be close to 4000, and indeed, that's what this choice is. So it turns out that it was already in the order that we needed it to be, but it's good that we checked on that.."
Math,"So pause this video, and try to work it out. And, actually, I'll give you a hint. Try to figure out, just using the digits, not even paying attention to the decimals, the digits that the product would have, and then use estimation to think about where to place the decimal in your product so you get a reasonable answer. All right, now, let's do this together. So let's just imagine that we were multiplying these numbers without decimals."
Math,"So that would be a situation where we would have 473 times 28, and so we could try to compute that. And, so, we could think about let's multiply everything times the eight, so three times eight is 24, seven times eight is 56, plus two is 58. And then four times eight is 32, plus five is 37. And then we could multiply everything times the two. I'll cross those out so I don't get confused."
Math,"Three times two is going to be six, so we have to be very careful, we are now in the tens place, so we want a zero here, so three times two tens is going to be six tens. Seven times two is 14. Four times two is eight, plus one is nine. We add everything together, and we get four plus zero is four, eight plus six is 14, and then one plus seven plus four is 12, and then we get one plus three is four, plus nine is equal to 13."
Math,"So we know that the final answer has the digits one, three, two, four, four in that order. One, three, two, four, four. So now we have to think about where would we put a decimal for this to be a reasonable answer? And here's where estimation is useful. We know that 2.8 times 4.73 is going to be roughly equal to what? Well, 2.8 is pretty close to three, so I'll estimate 2.8 as being three."
Math,"And 4.73 is, if I had to estimate, I would say, ""Hey, it'd be pretty close to five."" So this should be pretty close to three times five, so it should be close to 15. So if I were to put the decimal there, that's way more than 15, so that doesn't seem reasonable. Even if I were to put the decimal there, 1,324.4 is still way more than 15. If I were to put the decimal there, still way more than 15. If I were to put the decimal there, hey, that actually feels about right."
Math,"13 and 244 thousandths is, is approaching 15, it's in the ballpark. And it's actually the closest, 'cause if we were to put the decimal there, then we go to 1.3244, so a lot less than 15. So if we want this to be roughly equal to 15, we definitely would wanna put the decimal right over there. That is the most reasonable computation we can do, 'cause we know the digits are going to be one, three, two, four, four, and this helps us put the decimal."
Math,"In the future, we're gonna come up with ways of doing it that where you don't necessarily have to estimate, but I encourage you, the estimation is always key. If you ever in your life forget some type of method or process for multiplying decimals, it's the estimation that allows you to understand whether you're coming up with a reasonable answer."
Math,"This is really important, 'cause the decimal, there's a, I remember reading a news story a couple years ago where someone put in a stock trade where they got the decimal wrong. And because of that, they essentially sold 10 times as many shares as they were supposed to, and so they lost hundreds of millions of dollars. So, anyway, decimals are important.."
Math,"Alright, now let's work through this together. And in this video, we're gonna explore multiple strategies. In the future, we're going to show you what's called the standard strategy, which you might use a lot, but the strategies we're gonna look at in this video are actually very helpful for understanding what multiplying decimals actually means, how it relates to multiplying fractions, as often the way that people, even people who have a lot of math behind them, how they actually multiply decimals."
Math,"So here, three times 25 hundredths. There's a couple of ways to think about it. One way is to say, hey, this is the same thing as three times, and I'm just gonna write it a different way. 25 hundredths, hundredths. If I have three times 25 of something, what is it going to be? Well, what's three times 25? Let's see. Two times 25 is 50, three times 25 is So it's going to be 75, and I'm multiplying, not just three times 25, I'm multiplying three times 25 hundredths."
Math,"Instead of 25 hundredths, I'm gonna have 75, 75 hundredths. Written out in words, this would be 75 hundredths. How would we write that as a decimal? That is the same thing as this, 75 hundredths. Another way to conceptualize this, to think about what this is, is if we were to write three times, we could write it as a fraction. We could write 25/100. This is another way of writing 25 hundredths. These are all equivalent. What is three times 25/100? Same idea."
Math,"This is going to be equal to, you could say this is 25/100 plus 25/100 plus 25/100. This is going to be 75 hundredths, which once again is 0.75. If you wanted to more formally view it as fraction multiplication, you could view it as 3/1 times 25/100, and you multiply the numerators, you get 75, you multiply the denominators, you get 100. Either way, in all of these situations, you're gonna get 75 hundredths."
Math,"Or, another way to think about it, is hey look, this thing right over here, this 25/100, this is the same thing as 1/4. So you could view this as three times 1/4. In fact, this is a decimal that it's good to recognize that this is the same thing as 1/4. So you could view this as three times 1/4, or 3/4, this is a fourth right here, 1/4 could be viewed as a fourth, so this is going to be equal to 3/4, three over four, All of these are equivalent."
Math,"If someone wanted it written out as a decimal, you could, you might know that 3/4 can be expressed as 75 hundredths, which in general, is a good thing to know. Now let's tackle slightly more complicated examples. Let's say we wanted to figure out, we wanted to figure out what 0.4 let me just do this in a new color, times 0.3 is going to be equal to. Pause the video and see if you can compute this, and I'll give you a hint, see if you can express these as fractions."
Math,"What we have here in white, we could read this as four tenths, and we could write it as a fraction, as 4/10, and we're gonna multiply that by what we have over here. This is three tenths, three tenths, which we could write as a fraction as 3/10, and so you could view this as 4/10 of 3/10 or 3/10 of 4/10, but we're multiplying these fractions, which we've seen before in other videos. What's going to happen? Well, if we multiply the numerator we get 12, or the numerators."
Math,"We multiply the denominators, you get 100. So you get 12 hundredths. If you wanted to write that as a decimal, it would be 0.12, 12 hundredths. You might notice something interesting here, and you'll see this more and more as you learn the standard method. 12 is four times three is 12, but now I have two digits behind the decimal, but notice, I have one digit behind the decimal here, one digit behind the decimal here, for a total of two digits behind the decimal."
Math,"I'm giving you a little bit of a hint about where we're going, but the important thing for this video is to recognize that you can re-express each of these as fractions, and then multiply the fractions to get something expressed in terms of hundredths, and then express that as a decimal.."
Math,"See if you can express these as fractions. So there's a couple ways you can express it as a fraction. You can express this as 3 1/10th 2 4/10ths let's get the same color, 2 4/10ths. Now whenever you're multi these are mixed numbers right over here and mixed numbers are not the super straightforward to multiply, it's easier if they were written as what's often known as improper fractions but essentially not as mixed numbers. So three is the same thing as 30/10ths."
Math,"So 30/10ths plus 1/10th, this is 31 two is the same thing as 20/10ths. So 20/10ths plus four is 24/10ths. over 10. And hopefully this makes sense too that 3.1 this three right over here, this is 30/10ths or I can write, let me write 30/10ths and that this is 1/10th. So this total is going to be 31/10ths. Likewise, this two is 20/10ths plus 4/10th because it's 24/10ths. And now we can multiply. So this is going to give us our denominator's pretty straightforward."
Math,"10 times 10 is and then 31 times 24, we can multiply in the traditional way that we're used to multiplying two digit numbers. 31 times 24 is going to be equal to four times one is four, four times three is 12, now we're gonna be multiplying in the tenths place. We're going to put a zero here. So two times one is two. We're really saying 20 times one is 20. But you get the idea. Two times one is two. Two times three is Really 600, because it's 20 times 30."
Math,"But I'm just following the standard multi the method for multiplication then you add these. And you're gonna get four seven. So when you multiply these two things together, in the numerator, you get 744 100ths. Which can also be expressed as this is the same thing as 700ths or 700 100ths I should say, plus 44/100ths and 700/100ths, that's just going to be equal to seven. So this is seven plus 44/100ths which we could write as that's our seven and 44/100ths. And we would be done."
Math,"And you might already be seeing a pattern. If you just took 31 and multiplied it by 24, you get 744. And notice, I have one and two digits behind the decimal point. Notice I have one and two digits behind the decimal point. And so think about whether that always works. Think about and why that might work."
Math,"If you just multiply the numbers as if they didn't have decimals, so you would've gotten 744 and you say, I got two numbers behind the decimal, so my product is going to have two numbers behind the decimal, why does that work? Or does it always work? And how does it relate to what we did here which is converting these things to improper fractions and then multiplying it that way?."
Math,"So what does 80 divided by 1.94 approximately equal? So we wanna estimate what this is. So pause this video and see if you can figure it out. So before we even look at these choices, how would we try to do this in our head? Well, we could say 1.94, it's hard to do that in our head to divide it into 80 but it's awfully close to two. So we could say this is close to, this is approximately equal to 80 divided by two 'cause once again, 1.94 is awfully close to two and then this is easy to figure out."
Math,"That is going to be equal to 40. So our first expression, you could say is approximately equal to 40. Is it exactly equal to 40? No but it's pretty close. So I would select that choice. Let's do another one. So pause this video and see if you can figure out the approximation. What is 209 divided by three roughly equal to? So once again, here we don't have any clear decimals."
Math,"If we were to divide it out, we would get a decimal answer for our quotient but what we could do is well, is either one of these, is for example 209, is it close to a multiple of three that we might recognize? Well, you might immediately recognize, well, if you think about multiples of three, you think in terms of, well, three times six is 18, three times seven is 21. Well, this is close to 210. So this is approximately equal to 210 divided by three."
Math,"Now, why is this interesting? Well, 210 is just 21 times 10. So if 21 divided by three is seven, 210 divided by three is going to be equal to 70. So once again, 209 is pretty close to 210. Remember, we're just estimating and so 209 divided by three would approximately be equal to 70 which is that choice right over there. Let's do one more example. So once again, pause the video and figure out what 6.86 divided by 1.12 is approximately equal to."
Math,"Alright, so here I would just try to round to the nearest whole number and see if that helps my division in my head. So 6.86 is approximately seven if we round up to the nearest whole number and if I say seven divided by, and if we round down, 1.12, seven divided by one, this is much easier for us to do in our head. So that is going to be seven. Now, once again, it's very important to realize these are estimations."
Math,"It's not going to be exactly equal to seven but it's definitely gonna be much closer to seven than 70, 700 or 7000.."
Math,"But now we don't want, we don't wanna just say, hey, how many times can it go in and what's left over. We wanna know exactly how many times can two go into five so we want a decimal answer right over here. So, pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right, now let's work through this together. And there's many ways that we could approach this."
Math,"One way is to realize that five divided by two, we could re-express as five divided by two or as five halves and five halves is the same thing as four plus one over two which is the same thing as four halves plus one half which is the same thing as four halves is two. Let me do that in a different color. This part over here is two and then you have this one half."
Math,"So it's the same thing as two and a half and if we were to express that as a decimal that's going to be equal to two and how many tenths is equal to a half? Well five tenths is equal to a half. So five divided by two, you could say, 2.5. Now another way that you could approach this is you say, five divided by two is the same thing as 50 tenths divided by two. So let me use a different color here."
Math,"So instead of a five, I could say five is the same thing as 50 tenths, 50 tenths divided by, divided by two and so if I have 50 of something and if I were to divide it by two, well that's going to result in 25 of the something. So this is going to be equal to 25 tenths. And how would we express 25 tenths as a decimal? Well, this is going to be equal to, if I could put some place values here, so we definitely have five tenths."
Math,"I'll put that in the tenths place and then 20 tenths is the same thing as two ones. And that's exactly what we had up here. Either way, you get 2.5, two ones and five tenths.."
Math,"I know when I said it in English, it sounds the same, but here, on the right, I've written it as 78/12, or 78 divided by 12. Now, how can we re-express this? Well, let's think about it. Is there a multiple of 12 that's near 78 without going above it? Well, we know that 12 times five is 60, 12 times six is 72, 12 times seven is 84, so 12 times seven is too high, but we can write this numerator as, instead of 78, I can write it as a multiple of 12 plus whatever's left over."
Math,"So, 72 plus six, that's the same thing as 78, so it's that divided by 12, and, so, I can write this as, I can write the 72/12, so this is equal to 72 over 12 plus six over 12, plus six over 12 or plus 6/12. Now, what's 72 over 12? We know that 72 is the same thing as six times 12."
Math,"So, this is going to be six times 12 divided by 12, well, that's just going to simplify to six, and then what is six 12ths? Well, you might recognize six as half of 12 or you could divide the numerator and the denominator both by six. Either way, you are going to get 1/2. So, you can view this as six plus 1/2 or you could view this as six and a half, and a lot of times, or as you get more used to this, you won't go do all of these steps, but I want to make sure you really understand what's going on."
Math,"So, this is the same thing as six and a half, and if I wanted to express that as a decimal, that's the same thing as six ones and then how many tenths? Well, 1/2 is the same thing as 5/10, so six and 5/10. So, there you go! That's one way of trying to compute what 78 divided by 12 is. Let's do another example. Let's say we wanted to compute what 20 divided by 80 is. Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. Well, we could use a similar technique."
Math,"We could say, hey, this is the same thing as 20 80ths, or we could write 20 the numerator and 80 the denominator, so it's the same thing as 20 divided by 80, and then we could think about, well, how can we simplify this fraction, or re-express it in some way? Well, let's see. We can write the numerator as... We could write this numerator as equal to one times 20, and then we could write the denominator as four times 20, as four times 20."
Math,"And, so, you could just view this as being equal to 1/4, this is equal to 1/4, times 20 over 20. Times 20 over 20, well, what's 20 over 20? Well, that's just one. That's just one, so this all just becomes 1/4. Now, how would we express that as a decimal? Well, let's see, it's hard to express 1/4 in terms of tenths 'cause four doesn't divide easily into 10, but you can express it in terms of hundredths. So, 1/4 is the same thing as 25 over a hundred. That's the same thing as 25/100."
Math,"Lemme write it down here so that I get more space. So, 1/4 is the same thing as 25 over 100, and you could get that by multiplying the numerator and the denominator here by 25, and the reason why I care about hundredths is we know how to represent hundredths as decimals. This is going to be the same thing as zero ones and 25/100. And, so, 20 divided by 80 is 0.25, or 25/100. So, once again, these are all different strategies for thinking about how we can divide numbers that result in decimals.."
Math,"All right, now let's work through this together. Let's actually try to think about what 4/10 looks like. So if you view this entire square as a whole, you see that we've divided it into 10 equal columns or 10 equal sections, and four of those tenths are shaded in, so what you see here in blue is 4/10. But how do we divide that into five and make sense of it? Well, one way to think about it is to imagine 4/10 not just as 4/10, but to imagine it as 40/100, so this would be imagining it as 40/100."
Math,"So we can re-write 4/10 divided by 5 as 40/100 divided by 5, and now we can think about taking these 40 hundredths, each of these little squares is a hundredth, and divide it into five equal sections, and then we can say, well, how many hundredths are in each of those five equal sections? So let's do that. So let's see, this is one, this is two, this is three, this is four and then we have five equal sections."
Math,"So how many hundredths are in each of those equal sections? Well we can see in each of them you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So 40/100 divided by five is going to be 8/100, because we have eight of these little squares in each of those five equal sections. So 8/100 we would like this. And so 40/100 divided by five is 8/100, then 4/10 divided by five is also equal to 8/100.."
Math,"We have 6/10 plotted on the number line right over here. And so one way to think about it is, if I wanted to go from zero to 6/10 in two jumps, how big would each of those jumps have to be? Pause this video and try to figure that out on your own before we work through it together. All right, so as I mentioned, one way to think about it is how can I go from zero to 6/10 in two jumps? Two equal jumps, I should say."
Math,"Well, if we just eyeball it right over here, I could do one jump like that and then another jump like that. So I did one jump and then two jumps. And so one way to think about it is we've divided 6/10 into two jumps, and each of those jumps are how far? Well, each of those jumps are one, two, 3/10. So this is 3/10 or I could write it like this, 3/10. We have another one, two, 3/10. So this is going to be equal to 3/10. And we've thought about it in other ways."
Math,"If you have six of something and you divide it by two, you're going to have two groups of three of that something. So if you have 6/10, and you wanna put it into two equal groups, well, each of those groups are going to be 3/10.."
Math,"And I'll give you a hint, see if you can think about 1.86 as a certain number of hundredths, and then divide that by two. All right now let's work through it together. So as promised, let's see if we can think of 1.86 as a certain number of hundredths. So if we go to the hundredths place, we only see six there, but we could view 8/10 as 80 hundredths. So you could view the .86 as 86 hundredths, and each one is 100 hundredths, so we really have 186 hundredths."
Math,"So this number right over here I'm going to rewrite as 186 hundredths, hundredths. And that is what we need to divide by two. Now, if you're dividing 186 of something by two, well it's just gonna be 186 divided by two of that something. So we could rewrite this as 186 divided by two, and then that's the number of hundredths this is going to be, so I'll put that in parenthesis. So it's going to be that many hundredths, hundredths."
Math,"All right, so what is 186 divided by two? Some of you might be able to do it in your head, some of you might wanna use some paper. The way I like to think about it is if I were to take the six ones and divide it by two, well that's going to be three ones. And then if I were to take the 18 tens and divided by two, that's going to be nine tens, so that gets us to 93."
Math,"Now you could've also thought about it like this, you could've said, how many times does two go into 186? Let's see, it doesn't go into one, how many times does it go into 18? Nine times, nine times two is 18, we could subtract, and then you have zero, you bring down that six. Two goes into six three times, three times two is six. You subtract and you get no remainders. So either way you're going to get 93. And it's 93 what? Well it's 93 hundredths, is what we're talking about. 93 hundredths."
Math,"And now we just wanna express 93 hundredths as a decimal. Well how do we do that? Well that's gonna be 0 point. The 90 hundredths is the same thing as 9/10, and then the three hundredths, is of course 300 hundredths. Three in the hundredths place. So it's 0.93, and so we can write it up here. This is going to be equal to 0.93, and we're done!."
Math,"So pause this video and use what I have, this little visual here, as a big hint to figure out what three divided by 75/100 is. All right, now let's do it together."
Math,"So as I said, we started with three ones, or three wholes, however you want to think about it, and you could divide division by 75/100 as saying, well how many equal groups of 75 hundredths can you divide these three wholes into? And so we thought about these three wholes in terms of hundredths, and the way it's been color coded, it actually has already been divided into four equal groups of 75 hundredths. You can count these, so this is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and then five hundredths."
Math,"So this right over here, this is one group of 75 hundredths. Then in green you have another group of 75 hundredths. So you have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and then 75, so that right over, let me use a color I can see. This right over here is our second group. This is our first group right over there. Then that's our third group, these are all equal groups of 75 hundredths, and that's our fourth equal group of 75 hundredths in the green again."
Math,"So how many equal groups of 75 hundredths can you divide three wholes into? Well, clearly it is equal to four.."
Math,"And as a little bit of a hint, think about two on the number line and think about how many jumps of 4/10 do you have to make starting at zero to get to two, to figure out what two divided by 4/10 is. All right, now let's do it together. And as I mentioned in my hint, let's just think about how many jumps of 4/10 we have to make to go from zero to two. And on this number line, each of these, this is a 10th right over here because we can see there's 10 equal spaces between zero and one."
Math,"So let's take some jumps of 4/10. So if we start at zero, we can make, let's see there's 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, 4/10. That's one jump. I'll number that. And then we can make our next jump of one, two, three, 4/10. Guess that's right over there. That's two jumps. Then our next jump will take us right over there. So once again I'm just making equal jumps of 4/10. Then my next jump will take us one, two, three, 4/10 further. So that gets us right over there. We've taken four jumps."
Math,"And then it looks like our fifth jump gets us there. One, two, three, 4/10. Our fifth jump gets us exactly to two. So we've taken five jumps of 4/10 to go from zero to two or another way to think about it is if you were to divide two into equal chunks of 4/10, you could divide into five equal chunks of 4/10. Or you could make five equal jumps to go from five equal jumps of 4/10 to go from zero to two.."
Math,"And like all things in mathematics, there's multiple strategies that you can use to try to figure out what three divided by two is. One strategy is, well, let's just rewrite this as a fraction, so three divided by two, you can write that as, you could write that as three over two. Now, or you could say, this is the same thing as 3/2. But how can we express this as a decimal? Well, you might recognize that 3/2 is the same thing as 2/2 plus 1/2, let me write that down."
Math,"So this is the same thing as two plus one over two, and I'm really doing every step here to hopefully make things clear, which is the same thing as two over two, so that's two over two, plus one over two, plus 1/2. I could break this up into two over two plus 1/2. Now, two over two is just one, and so this is going to be equal to 1 1/2. Now, you might immediately say, ""Hey, 1/2, I could write that as 5/10,"" and that would be exactly right."
Math,"You could just, we don't wanna spell out every step, we could say this is equal to one, and when we write it in decimal form, we express things as tenths or hundredths or thousandths, so 1/2 is the same thing as 5/10, and if we wanna express that as a decimal, this would be equal to one and five tenths. Now I did every step here, as you get more practice, you say okay this is the same thing as 3/2."
Math,"3/2, two goes into three one time, and there's a 1/2 left over, so writing this as a mixed number, it's 1 1/2, and 1/2 written as a decimal is 0.50, so this is 1.50. Now another way that we could've thought about this is ""Okay, I'm not getting a whole number, ""when I divide three divided by two."
Math,"""Maybe I'll get something in terms of tenths, ""so let me express each of these in terms of tenths."" So three is how many tenths? Well, three is 30 tenths, and we'd be dividing by two, we're gonna be dividing it by two, so 30 tenths divided by two, well that's going to be equal to 15 tenths. This is equal to 15 tenths, which is equal to 10 tenths and five tenths, or 1.50. So both of these are equally legitimate strategies for figuring out what three divided by two is."
Math,"I like the first one a little bit, it leverages what we know about fractions, but let's do another example. Let's do a few more examples, this is fun. Let's figure out what 34 divided by four is, and like before, pause this video and try to figure it out and try to see if you can use some of the strategies that we used in the last video. Alright, so as we just said, we can re-express this as a fraction, this is the same thing as 34 divided by four, 34 divided by four, or 34/4."
Math,"Now what is this going to be equal to? Well, four goes into 34 eight times, it's gonna go eight times, and you're gonna have two left over, so this is eight and 2/4. Eight, let me write it both out. Alright, eight and 2/4, let me do that two in that blue just for fun. Eight and two over four, 8 2/4, so how do I do this again? I said four goes into 34 eight times, and then I have two left over, so I'm gonna have 2/4 left over."
Math,"Another way, if you wanna see all the steps, you can say, ""Hey I can rewrite this as 32 over four ""plus two over four."" The 32 over four is our eight, so 8 2/4. Well 2/4, that's the same thing as 1/2. That's the same thing as 1/2, and if we wanna express that in terms of tenths, this is equal to eight and, 1/2 is the same thing as 5/10, 8 5/10, which if we wanna express as a decimal is of course eighth and five tenths, or 8.50, and we are done."
Math,"Let's do another one of these, and actually let's do one of them where we're dividing into a decimal, where a decimal itself is being divided. Let's say we wanted to calculate 8.4 divided by seven. Pause this video and see if you can figure it out. When you look at this, you might immediately say well I know 84 is divisible by seven."
Math,"We know if you know your seven times tables, we know that seven times 12 is equal to 84, or that 84 divided seven is equal to 12, but this isn't 84, this is 8.4, so how do we think about it? Well one way, we can think about it in terms of tenths, 8.4 is the same thing as 84 tenths, and so 84 tenths divided by seven, well 84 of anything divided by seven is going to be 12 of that thing, so it's gonna be 12 tenths, and 12 tenths we can rewrite as one and 2/10, 1.20 and we are done, so this is equal to 1.2."
Math,"Another way that we could have thought about this is we could've said, you know what, 84 tenths is the same thing as 84 over 10. If fact, you would read this as 84/10, and now you wanna divided this by seven. So you wanna divide this by seven, this is the same thing, when you divide by something, it's the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so it's 84 over ten times 1/7, which is equal to, we can change, let me write it this way."
Math,"This is equal to 84 over 10 times seven, over ten times seven, and now we could simplify this. If we divide the numerator and the denominator by seven, 84 divided by seven is 12, seven divided by seven is one. 12 divided by ten, this is gonna be equal to 12/10, which is 1.2, we could write this as 1 2/10, or 1.2. Let's do one more example that's kind of related. Let's say we wanna figure out what seven divided by 70 is. Pause this video and try to figure it out."
Math,"Well, we can rewrite this, as we've been doing, as seven over 70. Instead of writing it as 70, let me write that as seven times ten, and what's valuable about this is we can divide the numerator and the denominator by seven. If we divide the numerator by seven, we get a one, we divide the denominator by seven, we get a one. Remember, we can do the same thing to the numerator and the denominator. If we multiply or divide by the same value, we're not changing the value of the actual fraction."
Math,"And so you're left with 1/10, which if you express it as a decimal, you go to the tenths place, you say I have one of those tenths, that's one tenth, so this is one tenth. Another way to think about it is this is the same thing as, and really this is what we wrote over here, but you could write this as seven divided by seven, divided by the blue seven, and then you divide by 10. If you're dividing by seven times ten, actually let me write that down."
Math,"If you're dividing by seven times ten, and this essentially another way of writing what we have over here, this is going to be equal to seven divided by seven divided by 10. Well, seven divided by seven is one, so you get one divided by 10, which is one tenth.."
Math,"All right, now let's work through this together. And there's a couple of ways that we can approach it. One way is to think about everything in terms of tenths. So two wholes is how many tenths? Well, a whole is equal to 10 tenths, so two wholes is equal to 20 tenths. So I could write the two, rewrite the two, as 20 tenths. And so that's going to be 20 tenths divided by, and instead of writing it this way, I could, instead of just writing it as 0.1, we know this is the same thing as one tenth."
Math,"So divided by one tenth. And so if I have 20 of something and if I divide it by, into groups of one of that something, how many groups am I going to have? Well, I'm going to have 20 equal groups of one. So 20 tenths divided by one tenth is equal to 20. Another way that you could approach that is you could rewrite the 0.1, the one tenth, as a fraction. We could rewrite this as two divided by, divided by, instead of writing one tenth like this, I could write it as a fraction, divided by 1/10."
Math,"Well, we know that dividing by a tenth is the same thing as multiplying by 10. So this is going to be equal to two times, two times 10. And that gets us to the same place that we had before. What is two times 10? Well, that is going to be equal to 20. That's good, that we got to the same answer, otherwise these would not be equivalent methods. Let's do another example. So let's say we wanted to figure out what six divided by one tenth is. Pause this video and see if you can figure that out."
Math,"All right, well, you could do the same idea. Six wholes is equal to how many tenths? It's equal to 60 tenths. So I'll rewrite this as 60 tenths, divided by one tenth, is equal to how many, is equal to what? Well, if I have 60 of something and if I divide it into groups of one of that something, I'm gonna have 60 equal groups of one. So this is going to be equal to 60. So you might see a pattern. When we divide it by a tenth, we end up multiplying by 10. When we divide by a tenth, we are multiplying by 10."
Math,"And you could do the same thing as we saw up here. You could take, you could say six divided by one tenth is the same thing as six divided by one tenth written as a fraction, which is going to be equal to six times, you could say six times 10 or six times 10 over one, either way. Six times 10 over one. Or, which is the same thing as 10, which is once again going to be equal to 60. So I think you see the general pattern. Divide by a tenth, same thing as multiplying by 10."
Math,"Now, what about if we dealt with hundredths? So let's say we wanna figure out what seven divided by a hundredth is. What would this be? Pause the video and try to figure it out. All right, well, we can do the same drill. So seven wholes, one whole is equal to a hundred hundredths, so seven wholes is equal to 700 hundredths. So this is equal to, I'll write it like this, 700 hundredths, hundredths, divided by, divided by one hundredth, one hundredth."
Math,"If I have 700 of something and if I'm dividing it into equal groups of one of that something, I'm gonna have 700 equal groups. So this is going to be equal to 700. So you divide by a hundredth, is the same thing as multiplying by a hundred. Now, you could also rewrite this as fraction if you like, so that some of the principles we saw up here still apply."
Math,"So we could rewrite this as seven divided by 1/100, and so this is going to be the same thing as seven times a hundred over one, or seven times a hundred. Seven times 100, which, once again, will get you to 700. So I think you see a pattern. Divide by a tenth, same thing as multiplying by 10. Divide by a hundredth, same thing as multiplying by a hundred.."
Math,"And why tenths, you ask? Well, I just described the second number as 4/10. So what would eight be in terms of tenths? Well, we know that one whole is equal to 10/10, so eight wholes is going to be equal to 80/10. So I could write that down over here. Instead of eight, I can write that as 80/10. And I'm taking 80/10 and I'm dividing that by, divided by 4/10. I'm just writing out, 4/10."
Math,"So if I have 80 of something, and if I'm diving it into groups of four of that something, how many equal groups am I going to have? Well, I'm gonna have 80 divided by four groups, or 80 divided by four, eight divided by four. Actually, let me just write that down. This is going to be equal to 80 over four or 80 divided by four. And eight divided by four is two, so 80 divided by four is going to be equal to 20. So eight divided by 4/10 is equal to 20."
Math,"Another way that you could think about that is to rewrite eight divided by 4/10 as eight over 4/10. Over 4/10. And then if you wanted to rewrite this, you could say, ""Hey, can I multiply the numerator ""and the denominator by some quantity that'll get rid ""of the decimal in the denominator?"" Well, I could multiply the denominator by 10. And if I don't wanna change the value of the fraction, I have to multiply the numerator by that same amount."
Math,"Well, what does that get us? Well, this is going to be equal to, in the denominator right over here, I'm just going to have a four. So we got rid of the decimal. In the numerator, I am going to get 80. So once again, we get 80 over four, which is equal to 20. Let's do another example, but in this case we'll deal with hundredths. So let's say we want to figure out what is 48 divided by 0.24 or 24/100? Pause this video and try to figure that out. All right, well, we can do something very similar."
Math,"This time we're dealing with hundredths, so we could try to express everything in terms of hundredths. So 48 is equal to how many hundredths? Well, we know that one is equal to 100/100, so 48 is going to be equal to 48 times 100/100. Maybe I'll just write it like that. Or you might be able to say, ""Hey, that's 4,800 ""or 4,800/100."" So let's just, actually, I'll write it that way. This is going to be 4,800/100 divided by, this is 24/100. 24/100."
Math,"And so what's that going to be? Well, same logic as we used up here. If I have 4,800 of something or 4,800 of something and if I'm dividing it into equal groups of 24 of that something, well, I'm going to have 4,800 divided by 24 equal groups. So this is going to be equal to 4,800 over 24. We could express 4,800 as, of course, 48 times a hundred. So this is equal to 48 times 100 over 24. And of course, you could view this as the same thing as this is equal to 48 over 24."
Math,"48 over 24, and many of you might have already done it in your head, times 100. What's 48 divided by 24? Well, that is going to be equal to two. So two times a hundred is equal to 200. So this right over here is equal to 200. You can also do it in this type or do it similar to the way we did this where instead of expressing it out as words, you could express it as 48 over 24/100."
Math,"And instead of multiplying the numerator and denominator by 10, maybe you wanna multiply it by something else to get whole numbers in both the numerator and denominator. Think about that after this video, and try to work it out that way as well.."
Math,"Pause this video and see if you can have a go at it. All right, well, one way to think about it is this is 237 10s, so if I put my place values here, so this is the 1,000s place, this is the 100s place, I'm just not writing it out in words just to save space, sometimes you'll see it written out as the word thousands, and hundreds, this is the 10s place, and then this is the 1s place. Well, if I were to just say seven 10s, I would put the seven over there."
Math,"If I were to say 37 10s, I would write it like this, because 30 10s is three 100s, and if I were to say 237 10s, I would write it just like that. Because 200 10s is two 1,000s. And so what just happened? Well, all of my digits shifted one place to the left. So what used to be in the 1s place is now in the 10s place."
Math,"What used to be in the 10s place is now in the 100s place, and what used to be in the 100s place is now in the 1,000s place, but what's in the 1s place? We have to put something in the 1s place. Well, we no longer have any 1s in this product, so we would just put a zero there. So 237 times 10 is 2,370."
Math,"Now, one way to think about it is, when I multiplied by 10, I really just shifted, I put a zero right over here at the end of this number, but it's important to realize that what really happened is I shifted all my digits one place to the left."
Math,"But what if we were to go in the other direction? What if we were to take, I don't know, 450 and we were to divide it by 10? Well, you can imagine if multiplying by 10 shifts the digits one place to the left, then dividing by 10 is going to shift the digits one place to the right, and so we have a four in the 100s place, we have a five in the 10s place, and we have nothing in the 1s place."
Math,"And so what used to be in the 100s place will now be in the 10s place, so I will put that four right over there, and then what used to be in the 10s place is now going to be in the 1s place, so I will put that five over there, and we have nothing in the 1s place-- If we did, and this is a little bit out of this video's purpose, but you could start to think what might happen if this was not a zero. But we have 450 divided by 10 is 45, and it is indeed 45."
Math,"Now, another way to think about it, other than the fact that all of the digits shifted one place to the right is that we removed this right zero here when we divided by 10. Now, let's extend that, let's say that we had 359 times 100. Pause this video and see if you can figure out what that is going to be. Well, there's two ways that you could think about it. You could just think of it in terms of this is 359 hundreds, so let's put some places here."
Math,"So let's say this is the 10,000s place, this is the 1,000s place, this is the 100s place, this is the 10s place, and this is the 1s place. So if you were to say nine 100s, you would go right over there, if you were to say 59 hundreds, it would be like that because 50 hundreds are five 1,000s, and if you were to say 359 hundreds, well, 300 hundreds is three 10,000s. And of course, in this scenario now, you would have no 10s and no 1s."
Math,"And so what we see happened is all of the digits shifted two places to the left. What was in the 1s place is now in the 100s place. What was in the 10s place is now in the 1,000s place, and what was in the 100s place is now in the 10,000s place and so this product is 35,900. Now, another way you could think about it is this is the same thing as 359 times 10 times 10. And we already know that every time you multiply by 10, you shift your digits one place to the left."
Math,"So if you're going to multiply by 10 twice, you're going to shift all your digits two places to the left, which is exactly what happened here. So based on that, what do you think-- or based on everything we've looked at, what do you think, if I were to take 75,000 and I wanted to divide it by 100, what do you think this is going to be? Pause the video and see if you can work through it on your own."
Math,"All right, well, we've already seen if you divide by 10, you shift the digits one place to the right, and dividing by 100 is really the same thing as dividing by 10 twice, so we really just need to shift all our digits two places to the right. So what used to be in the 10,000s place is now going to go to the 100s place. What used to be in the 1,000s place is now going to be in the 10s place, and what used to be in the 100s place is now going to go into the 1s place."
Math,"And so what we are going to get is, instead of seven 10,000s, we're going to get seven 100s, instead of five 1,000s, we're going to get five 10s, and then instead of zero 100s, we will now have zero 1s. So this is equal to 750. Another way to think about it, and we've talked about it before, if you're dividing by 100 and if you have some of these trailing zeros here, well, then, you would remove two of these right-trailing zeros, but it's really important to know why that happened."
Math,"Now, you've hopefully seen a pattern, so I'll ask you two more questions. Let's say that someone were to walk up to you on the street and say, ""Hey, you, what is 164 times 1,000?"" and they were also to ask you, ""What is 98,000, I'll just say 98,000 divi-- ""I'll say 198,000 divided by 1,000?"" Pause this video and see if you can do this. All right, you've probably seen the pattern now."
Math,"Just as multiplying by 100 was multiplying by 10 twice, multiplying by 1,000 is multiplying by 10 three times, so this is equal to 164, and I'll color-code this, times 10 times 10 times 10, so what we're going to do is shift all the digits three places to the left. So instead of 164, this four is no longer in the 1s place, it is now in the 1,000s place. It is now in the 1,000s place, and that makes sense. If you take four 1s and you multiply it by 1,000, you're going to get four 1,000s."
Math,"What was in the 10s place is now in the 10,000s place, and what was in the 100s place is now going to be in the 100,000s place, and so, in order to represent this number, I'll have to put something in the 100s place, we'll have no 100s now, I have to put something in the 10s place, I have no 10s now, and I have to put something in the 1s place. So it's going to be 164,000, and once again, that's consistent with the pattern we saw. We've added three zeros to the right of this number."
Math,"So similarly, what's going to happen over here? Well, we're going to shift all the digits three places to the right, so the one, it's going to go one, two, three places to the right, so what was in the 100,000s place is going to go into the 100s place, what was in the 10,000s place is going to go one, two, three places to the right, it's going to go into the 10s place, and what was in the 1,000s place is going to shift one, two, three digits to the right, it's going to be in the 1s place, or another way to think about it is when we divide by 1,000, especially when we have these three trailing zeros, those are going to go away."
Math,"So instead of 100,000 here, this is just going to be 100. Instead of 90,000 here, or nine 10,000s, this is just going to be nine 10s. And instead of eight 1,000s, this is just going to be eight, so it's equal to 198.."
Math,"Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. Well, in previous videos, we've already said that when you multiply by 10, you shift each of the digits one place to the left. And so this is going to be equal to, instead of two ones, we're now going to have two 10s, so two in the tens place. And then, instead of zero tenths, we're now going to have zero ones. And instead of five hundredths, we're now going to have five tenths, so this is equal to 20.5."
Math,"Now what if we were to go the other way around? What if we were to say 2.05 divided by 10? Pause the video and see if you can figure that out. Well here, all of our digits are going to shift one place to the right because we're dividing by 10. You could also view that as multiplying by 1/10. And so our two ones are going to become two tenths, so this is going to be zero point, so we're gonna have two tenths now."
Math,"Our zero tenths are going be zero hundredths, and then our five hundredths are going to be five thousandths, we've covered that in other videos, but now let's do this with, say, 100 or 1000. So if I were to ask you what is 57 divided by 1000? Pause this video and see if you can work that out. All right, now let's do this together. So when you divide by 1000, that's the same thing as dividing by 10 three times."
Math,"Or it's the same thing as multiplying by 1/10 three times, or you could just say hey, that means I'm going to shift each of these digits three places to the right, and so let me create some places here. So that's 10s, ones, tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and so our five was in the 10s place, it's five 10s, so it was here, but we're going to shift three places to the right. One, two, three. So our five will go there. So what was five 10s is now five hundredths."
Math,"And then our seven is similarly going to, it was in the ones place, but we're gonna shift three places to the right. One, two, three. And there you have it. What was just 57 is now 57 thousandths. And to make that very clear, I'll put a zero in the tenths place and a zero in the ones place, and that makes sense. So as another example, let's say someone walks up to you on the street and says I started with 1.032 and I multiplied it by something and I was able to get 103.2."
Math,"What did they multiply by to get 103.2? Pause this video and try to work it out. Well to understand this, we just have to think well, how much did each digit get shifted by? So what was in the ones place got shifted not just to the 10s place, but it got shifted to the hundreds place. So it got shifted two places to the left. The zero, similarly, got shifted two places to the left. From the tenths to the 10s, and if you look at it, every digit got shifted two places to the left."
Math,"And we must have multiplied by 10 twice, so you could say times 10 times 10, or you could just rewrite this as times 100. Let's just do one more example for kicks. Let's say that someone were to say what is 0.015 times 100? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right, well, like we've done before, we're just going to shift every digit two places to the left."
Math,"So the one, which is in the hundredths place, is going to end up in the ones place, and then the five, which is in the thousandths place, is going to end up in the tenths place. So this is going to be equal to 1.5, and we're done.."
Math,"I could take two 10s and multiply them together, so 10 times 10, which you know is equal to 100. I could take three 10s and multiply them together. 10 times 10 times 10 is equal to 1000. And I could do this with any number of 10s. But at some point, if I'm doing this with enough 10s, it gets pretty hard to write. So for example, let's say I were to do this with 10 10s."
Math,"So if I were to go 10 times 10 times 10 times 10, that's four, that's five, that's six, that's seven, that's eight, that's nine, that is 10 10s. Let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. This is going to be equal to, even the number that it's equal to is going to be quite hard to write. It's going to be one followed by 10 zeroes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. We put the commas there so it's just a little bit easier to read."
Math,"This right over here is 10 billion, and it's already getting kinda hard to write, and imagine if we have 30 10s that we were multiplying together. So mathematicians have come up with a notation and some ideas to be able to write things like this a little bit more elegantly. So the way they do this is through something known as exponents. Exponents. And so 10 times 10, we can rewrite as being equal to, if I have two 10s and I'm multiplying them together, I could write this as 10 to the second power."
Math,"That's how someone would say it. They would say 10 to the second power. That looks fancy, but all that means is let's take two 10s and multiply them together and we're going to get 100. Just so you're familiar with some of the parts of this, the two would be called the exponent and the 10 would be the base. So 10 to the second power is 10 times 10 is equal to 100."
Math,"So how would you write 10 times 10 times 10 or 1000? How would you write that using exponents? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. Well, as exactly as you might have imagined, we're taking a certain number of 10s and we see we're taking three 10s and we're multiplying them together. So this would be 10 to the third power. 10 is the base, three is the exponent. We would read this as 10 to the third power."
Math,"If you ever saw 10 to the third power, that means hey, let me multiply 10 times 10 times 10. That's the same thing as 1000. So this is really another way of writing 1000. And what about this number here, 10 billion? What's a way that we could write it using exponents? Pause the video and figure that out. Well as you might have imagined, we were taking 10 10s and multiplying them together. This is 10 to the 10th power. And we can go the other way around."
Math,"If someone were to walk up to you on the street and say what is 10 to the fifth power? What is that? What number that you're probably familiar with would this be? Well this would mean that we're going to take five 10s and multiply them together. So 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10. And so 10 times 10 is 100, 100 times 10 is 1000, 1000 times 10 is 10000, 10000 times 10 is equal to 100000. So there you have it."
Math,"You have the basics of exponents when we're dealing with 10, and I know what you were thinking. Can I put another number here instead of 10? And the simple answer is, you can, but we're not gonna cover that just yet in this video.."
Math,"You knew that already. But let's multiply by 10 again. So let's do 1 times 10. And now let's multiply by another 10. Let's multiply by another 10. So what's this going to be? This is going to be 1 times 10, which is 10, and then that 10 times 10. So it's literally 10 10s or 100. Now let's multiply by 10 again. So we're going to have 1 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10."
Math,"What is this going to be equal to? Well we already know that 1 times 10 times 10 is 100, and then we're going to multiply that times 10 again. So we're going to literally have 10 100s which we know is the exact same thing as 1,000. So what's the pattern here? Well here we multiplied by 10 once and we have one zero. Here we multiplied by 10 twice and we have two zeroes. Here we multiplied by 10 three times and we have three zeroes in our answer."
Math,"Let's do it again, although this looks like a pretty clear pattern. Let's multiply by 10 four times. So we'll start with a 1. We'll multiply by one 10, that's our first 10, then our second 10, then our third 10, and now our fourth 10. Well what's this going to be equal to? Well it's going to be this thing, I should say, times 10 or 1,000 times 10, which is 1,000s. So let me write that 10 1,000s. So once again, we started with a one, we multiplied by 10 four times, and we got 10,000."
Math,"One followed by one, two, three, four zeros. Let me make that clear. We start with a 1. We multiplied by 10 one, two, three, four times, and our product is one followed by one, two, three, four zeros. So I think you see the pattern here. But there might be something you're craving. You're like, hey Sal, this is a pain to do this repeated multiplication. I wish there was some type of operation that just did it for us."
Math,"The same way that back in the day when you were doing repeated addition where if you were saying 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10, you said, hey, this is the same thing as 4 times 10. There should be another thing for repeated multiplication. If I have 1 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10, which is really the same thing as taking four 10s and multiplying them together because the 0 doesn't change the value. So 10 times 10 times 10 times 10."
Math,"You're saying, hey, there should be some type of shorthand for this, and you're right. There is some type of shorthand for this and it's called an exponent. So the same way if you take four 10s and add them up, that's the same thing as 4 times 10. If you take four 10s and take their product, this is the same thing as 10 to the fourth power. 10 to the fourth power literally means taking four 10s and multiplying them together. Or you could view it as starting with a 1 and multiplying by 10 four times."
Math,"So this is also equal to 10 to the fourth power. This right over here, we started with a 1. We multiplied by 10 three times, which is the same thing as taking three 10s and multiplying them together. This is 10 to the third power. This right over here is 10 squared, or 10 to the second power. And this right over here, we just have one 10 right over here. We just started with the one and we multiplied by 10 once. This is 10 to the first power."
Math,"And just so you know a little bit of the terminology, here 10 is our base. The base is 10. And this 4 that we have right over here, this is the exponent. So given that notation, let's just do one practice. Let's think about what-- I'll do new colors-- what 10 to the sixth power is. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Well there's two ways to think about it. You could view this as six 10s-- so 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, and 10 and multiplying them together. So we multiply them all together."
Math,"Or you could view it as starting with a 1 and multiplying it by 10 six times. But either way, what are you going to get? Well if you're multiplying 1 by 10 six times, you're going to end up with 1 followed by six zeroes. We already saw this pattern. So it's going to be 1 followed by one, two, three, four, five, six zeros, or one million. So 10 to the sixth power is the same thing as 1 being multiplied by 10 six times. We're taking six 10s and multiplying them together."
Math,"And that's going to be equal to 1 followed by six zeros, which is this pattern we saw or one million.."
Math,"If we take 10 to the third power, that's going to be three 10s multiplied together, which is equal to 1000, which is also one followed by three zeroes. So you're already starting to see a pattern. What we're going to do in this video is think about patterns when we multiply arbitrary things or divide arbitrary things by powers of 10. So let's start with a number. Let's say I will start with 2.3. And let's first just multiply by 10 to the first power."
Math,"Well, that's the same thing as just multiplying it by 10, and we've seen already when you multiply by 10, you shift all the digits one place to the left. So the two, which is the ones place, one's up in the 10s place, and then three, which is in the tenths place will end up in the ones place. So this is just going to be equal to 23. And it's always good to do a little bit of a reality check."
Math,"If I just had two and if were to multiply it by 10, you'd say okay, that's about 20, so it makes sense that 2.3 times 10 is 23. But let's keep going. Now let's multiply 2.3 not by 10 to the first power, which is just 10, but let's multiply it times 10 to the second power. What is that going to be? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out."
Math,"All right, well 10 to the second power, we already know that's equal to 100, and so when you multiply by 100 or you multiply by 10 twice, you're just going to shift every digit two places to the left. So let me draw some places here. So the thing that is in the ones place will go to the hundreds place, and the thing that is in the tenths place will go to the 10s place. And so this two will now be two hundreds. This 3/10 will now be three 10s and we now have zero ones."
Math,"And then if we were to multiply by 10 again, so if we were to say 2.3 times 10 to the third power, well then we're going to shift everything three places to the left. 10 to the third power. This is the same thing as multiplying by 1000. So 2.3 times 10 to the third, the two is going to be shifted three places to the left, so the two is going to become 2000, which makes sense. So it's going to be 2000."
Math,"The 3/10 is going to shift two places to the left, so it's going to be 300, and then we now have zero 10s and zero ones. So the pattern that you've probably seen is if you multiply a number times 10 to some power, you are just shifting the digits to the left by that power. And if we divide by a power of 10, the same thing would happen, but we would now be shifting our digits' places to the right."
Math,"So for example, what is 2.3 divided by, divided by 10 to the first power? Pause this video and try to figure that out. Well 10 to the first power is the same thing as 10, so when we divide by 10, all of our digits are just going to shift one place to the right, so this two is going to end up in the tenths place and the three is going to end up in the hundredths place. So this is going to give us 0.23. Two is now in the tenths, three is now in the hundredths, but we could keep going."
Math,"What if we were to say 2.3 divided by 10 to the second power? Pause this video, try to figure out what that is. Well in this situation, we are going to shift all the digits two places to the right and so let me put my places here, so that's the ones, tenths, hundredths, thousandths. And so the thing that's in the ones place is two. It won't just go to the tenths. It'll go to the hundredths place, which you don't quite see here. It's right over there. So the two is going to show up here."
Math,"And then the three is going to shift two places to the right, and so it's going to end up there, and we have zero ones and we have zero 10s. So you're probably already seeing the pattern here again. Whatever the exponent is, if you're dividing by 10 to that power, you're going to shift that power, the exponent that many times you're going to shift the digit that many places to the right.."
Math,"So that's three, four, and five. So it's 1 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10. Notice one, two, three, four, five. And what's this going to be? Well, 1 times 10 is 10. 10 times 10 is 100. 100 times 10 is 1,000. 1,000 times 10 is 10,000. 10,000 times 10 is 100,000. So this is going to be 100,000. Now, you might have noticed, every time we multiply it by 10, we're adding another 0 to the product. So if we're multiplying by 10 five times, we're going to add five 0's to the product."
Math,"So this is literally going to be 1 followed by five 0's, one, two, three, four, five. So 10 to the fifth is the same thing as 100,000. Let's do another one that is on a similar topic. How many 0's does the product 67 times 10 to the fifth have? Well, there's a bunch of ways of thinking about that. 67 times 10 to the fifth is the exact same thing, this is equivalent to-- you could view this as 67 times. And we could use the same exact logic that we just saw in the previous problem."
Math,"So 67 times 1 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10. And we already figured out exactly what this is. If you have 1 multiplied by 10 five times, this right over here is going to be 1 followed by five 0's. One, two, three, four, five. Or it's going to be 100,000. So there's a couple ways to think about it. If you're looking at just this product right over here, you could say, well, 67 times 1 is just going to be 67. And then every time you multiply by 10, you're going to add another 0."
Math,"So you could say, well, this is just going to be 67. And we're going to be multiplying by 10 five times, so we're going to add five 0's here. One, two, three, four, five. And so this would come to 6,700,000. Another way you could think about it-- this is the same thing as 67 times 100,000, so it's going to be 67, and then we have five 0's here. So once again, one, two, three, four, five. You get the exact same value. Let's do another one."
Math,"How many 0's does the quotient 5,700,000 divided by 10 to the third power have? Well, 10 to the third power we already know. 10 to the third power-- that's the same thing as 1 times 10 times 10 times 10, which is the same thing as 1,000. And so if we're dividing by that, that's the same thing. So another way of writing this expression right over here. So 5,700,000 divided by 10 to the third is the same thing as-- I could write this way. 5,700,000 divided by 10 times 10 times 10."
Math,"We could put a 1 out here, but this won't really change the value, which is equivalent to 5,700,000 divided by 1,000. And either way you think about it, every time you divide by 10, you're going to eliminate one of these 0's. So if you divide by 10 three times-- so if you divide by 10 once, you're going to eliminate a 0. Divide by 10 again, you're going to eliminate another 0. Divide by 10 again, you're going to eliminate another 0. You're going to be left with 5,700."
Math,"Another way of thinking about it is, well, if I'm dividing by something that has three 0's, I'm going to eliminate three 0's. So if I eliminate three 0's, I am left with 5,700. Now, just to be clear, I could only do this because this was 1,000. If this was like 3,000 or something, I could think of this as 3 times 1,000. And then I could only cancel out the 1,000 with these 0's. But the 3 I would then have to divide separately. But only because I'm straight up dividing by 1,000."
Math,"I'm dividing by a power of 10. I have three 0's here. I can cancel it out with three 0's there. Let's do another one. So it asks you to do a few. And these are the type of questions that you might see in the exercise. When 72.1 is multiplied by 10 to the third, the decimal point moves blank places to the blank. And in the exercise, you might see a dropdown here."
Math,"So remember, if you're multiplying by-- and this is essentially 10 to the third, so you're multiplying by 1,000, you're going to get a larger number. You're not going to get a smaller number. And so every time you multiply by 10, your decimal point is going to move to the right because you're getting larger. So we're going to move the decimal point. So 72.1, if we multiplied it by 10 once, then we would move the decimal point over once. And we'd get 721, which makes sense. 72 times 10 is 720."
Math,"72.1 times 10 should be 721. But if we want to multiply it by 10 three times, we're going to move the decimal place over not just once, but twice, and three times. And you say wait, wait. How could I move it over? There's nothing here. Well, you throw a 0 in there. And so you're going to get, it's going to be equal to-- so it's going to be equal to 72,100. Now, they're not asking us that. They're just asking how we would do it. And we saw the decimal point moves three places to the right."
Math,"And the big key here is you're going to get a larger number when you multiply by 10 three times, or multiply by 1,000. Let's do this one. When 56 is divided by 10 to the third, the decimal point moves blank places to the blank. Well, dividing by 10 to the third is the same thing as dividing by 10 three times. And every time you divide by 10, it's going to become a smaller number. So 56, and you might say, where is the decimal point? Well, there's implicitly a decimal point right over there."
Math,"You divide by 10 once, you're going to get a smaller number. 56 is going to become 5 and something, so it's going to become literally 5.6. Divide by 10 again, it's going to become 0.56. Divide by 10 again, you're like, wait. If I keep moving the decimal place again to the left, what am I moving it to the left of? Well, you could throw a 0 right over here. And so if you move the decimal point three places to the left, you are left with 0.056. And you might want to put a 0 out here just for clarity."
Math,But what we did here is we moved the decimal point three places to the left in this situation. We got a smaller value..
Math,"And so if you start with 34-- let me put a little decimal right over here. It will be clear that there is an implied decimal there, so we could just keep adding zeroes if we want. So when we divide by 10, we're going to move the decimal one space over to the left. And you should always do a reality check. If you forget, hey, do I move it over to the left, or do I do it over to the right? You should do a reality check."
Math,"Look, if I'm dividing by 10, should I get a smaller value or a larger value? Well, clearly, if you're dividing it into 10 groups, you should get a smaller value. So when you take your decimal place to the left, you're going to get a smaller value. 34 is going to become 3.4. And that makes complete sense. If you were to multiply 3.4 by 10, you would move the decimal to the right, and you would get to 34. Let's think about this one. So this one right over here is 3.4. Now let's think about 7/10."
Math,"So the exact same idea. This is equal to 7 divided by 10. This fraction, horizontal line symbol thing could literally be viewed as ""divided by."" This could be read as 7 divided by 10. So when you divide by 10, you move the decimal one space over to the left. So we're going to get to point 7. And just to be clear, we could write this as 0.7. It's sometimes dangerous to just write the decimal without the zero out front. So 7/10, or 7 divided by 10, can be rewritten as 0.7. Now let's try 53/100."
Math,"Well, we'll start with our 53. Once again, this could be interpreted as 53 divided by 100. So there's an implied decimal point right over here. Now, if we're dividing by 100, that's dividing by 10 and then dividing by 10 again. This is dividing by 10 times 10. So we're going to divide by 10, and then we're going to divide by 100. So the decimal is going to land right over there. So that's going to get us to 0.53. Now let's tackle 2 divided by 100. So once again, this could be rewritten as 2 divided by 100."
Math,"2/100 is the same thing as 2 divided by 100. If we start with a 2, put our decimal point right there. So we're going to divide by 10, and we're going to do that twice. So we're going to divide by 10 once. That would be 2/10. That puts our decimal there. But we have to divide by 10 again. You might say, hey, look, there's nothing here. Well, you could just throw a zero on here, just so that you do something there, and then you have moved your decimal over to the left twice."
Math,"Remember, every time you're doing it, you're dividing by 10. You're dividing by 10. Then you're dividing by 10 again. Dividing by 10 two times, that's the same thing as dividing by 100, because 10 times 10 is 100. So this is going to be 0.02. Now we've already seen that, if you were to try to read this, this 2 is in the hundredths place. So you would literally read this as 2 hundredths. And we see that right over here. We've literally represented it as 2 hundredths right over there-- 2/100."
Math,"So now we have 1,098 divided by 100. Well, same drill. Or 1,098 hundredths I could say. That's the same thing as 1,098 divided by 100. So we could start with 1,098. The decimal is implicitly right over here, but we need to move it two spaces to the left-- one, two-- because we're dividing by 100. That gets us to 10.98. And always do a reality check. Look, it makes sense. We got to a significantly smaller value when we divided by 100. Now we'll just divide 9,967 by 1,000."
Math,"Well, 9.967, decimal point implicitly there. Now, 1,000 is 10 times 10 times 10. So if you're dividing by 1,000, that's dividing by 10 three times. So we'll divide by 10 once, divide by 10 twice, divide by 10 three times. We get to 9.967. So another way of writing 9,967 thousandths, well, that's just going to be 9.967. Or I could literally read it as 9 and 967 thousands. And that also makes sense. I mean, you could break this up into 9,000 plus 967. And so 9,000 thousandths is going to be 9."
Math,And then you're going to be left with the 967 thousandths..
Math,"So let's write down all the place values. So this right over here, this is the ones place. Now, we could move to the right. And as we move to the right in place values, each place represents 1/10 of the place before it. Or you could divide by 10 as we're moving to the right. So this is the ones place. This is divide by 10. This is the 1/10 place, or the tenths place. Divide by 10 again, this is the hundredths place. Divide by 10 again, this is the thousandths place."
Math,"And that ""s"" I'm just saying to be plural-- hundredths, thousandths. Now, if we go to the left, now each place represents a factor of 10 more. So if this is ones, multiply by 10, this is the tens place. This is the hundreds place. This is the thousands place. This is the ten thousands place. I'm going to have to write a little bit smaller. This is the hundred thousands place. And then the 7 is in the millions place."
Math,"So what does this number, what does this 3 represent? Well, it's in the hundred thousands place. It literally represents 3 hundred thousands, or you could say 300,000, 3 followed by five zeroes. Now, what does this 3 represent? It's in the hundredths place. It literally represents 3 hundredths. It represents 3 times 1/100, which is the same thing as 3, which is equal to 3 over-- let me do the 3 in that purple color. Which is the same thing as 3/100, which is the same thing as 0.03."
Math,"These are all equivalent statements. Now let's try to answer our original question. How much larger is this 3 than that 3 there? Well, one way to think about it is how much would you have to multiply this 3 by to get to this 3 over here? Well, one way to think about is to look directly at place value. So we got to multiply by 10. Every time we multiply by 10, that's equivalent to thinking about shifting it to one place to the left."
Math,"So we would have to multiply by 10 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven times. So multiplying by 10 seven times. Let me write this down. So this multiplied by 10 seven times should be equal to this. Let me rewrite this. 300,000 should be equal to 3/100-- let me write it the same way. 3/100 multiplied by 10 seven times, so times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10-- let's see, that's five times-- times 10 times 10."
Math,"Now, multiplying by 10 seven times is the same thing as multiplying by 1 followed by seven zeroes. Every time you multiply by 10, you're going to get another zero here. So this is the same thing as 3/100 times 1 followed by one, two, three, four, five, six, seven zeroes. So this is literally 3/100 times 10 million. So let's see if this actually is the case."
Math,"Does this actually equal 300,000? Well, if you divide 10 million by 100, dividing 10 million by 100, or I guess you'd say in the numerator, you have 10 million and the denominator you have 100, if you were to just multiply it like this, if you view this as 3 over 100 times 10 million over 1. Well, you divide the numerator by 100, you're going to get rid of two of these zeroes. Divide the denominator by 100, you're going to get rid of this 100 here."
Math,"And so you're going to be left with 3 times-- now we got to be careful with the commas here, because since I removed two zeroes, the commas are going to be different. It's going to be 3 times-- we put our commas in the right place, so just like that. So this simplified to 3 times 100,000, which is indeed 300,000. So it did work out. Shifting the 3 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven decimal places makes that 3 worth 1 followed by seven zeroes more, or it essentially makes that 3 worth 10 million more."
Math,So this 3 represents 10 million times the value of this 3. Let me write down the numbers. So this 3 is 10 million times the value of that 3..
Math,"You want to be able to measure it. You want to be able to quantify how much longer the second one is than the first one. And how do we go about doing that? Well, we define a unit length. So if we make this our unit length, we say this is one unit, then we could say how many of those the lengths are each of these lines? So this first line looks like it is-- we could do one of those units and then we could do it again, so it looks like this is two units."
Math,"While this third one looks like we can get-- let's see that's 1, 2, 3 of the units. So this is three of the units. And right here, I'm just saying units. Sometimes we've made conventions to define a centimeter, where the unit might look something like this. And it's going to look different depending on your screen. Or we might have an inch that looks something like this. Or we might have a foot that I won't be able to fit on this screen based on how big I've just drawn the inch or a meter."
Math,"So there's different units that you could use to measure in terms of. But now let's think about more dimensions. This is literally a one-dimensional case. This is 1D. Why is it one dimension? Well, I can only measure length. But now let's go to a 2D case. Let's go to two dimensions where objects could have a length and a width or a width and a height. So let's imagine two figures here that look like this. So let's say this is one of them. This is one of them. And notice, it has a width and it has a height."
Math,"Or you could view it as a width and the length, depending on how you want to view it. So let's say this is one figure right over here. And let's say this is the other one. So this is the other one right over here. Try to draw them reasonably well. Now, once again, now we're in two dimensions. And we want to say, well, how much in two dimensions space is this taking up? Or how much area are each of these two taking up? Well, once again, we could just make a comparison."
Math,"This second, if you viewed them as carpets or rectangles, the second rectangle is taking up more of my screen than this first one, but I want to be able to measure it. So how would we measure it? Well, once again, we would define a unit square. Instead of just a unit length, we now have two dimensions. We have to define a unit square. And so we might make our unit square. And the unit square we will define as being a square, where its width and its height are both equal to the unit length."
Math,"So this is its width is one unit and its height is one unit. And so we will often call this 1 square unit. Oftentimes, you'll say this is 1 unit. And you put this 2 up here, this literally means 1 unit squared. And instead of writing unit, this could've been a centimeter. So this would be 1 square centimeter. But now we can use this to measure these areas."
Math,"And just as we said how many of this unit length could fit on these lines, we could say, how many of these unit squares can fit in here? And so here, we might take one of our unit squares and say, OK, it fills up that much space. Well, we need more to cover all of it. Well, there, we'll put another unit square there. We'll put another unit square right over there. We'll put another unit square right over there. Wow, 4 units squares exactly cover this."
Math,"So we would say that this has an area of 4 square units or 4 units squared. Now what about this one right over here? Well, here, let's seem I could fit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. So here I could fit 9 units, 9 units squared. Let's keep going. We live in a three-dimensional world. Why restrict ourselves to only one or two? So let's go to the 3D case. And once again, when people say 3D, they're talking about 3 dimensions. They're talking about the different directions that you can measure things in."
Math,"Here there's only length. Here there is length and width or width and height. And here, there'll be width and height and depth. So once again, if you have, let's say, an object, and now we're in three dimensions, we're in the world we live in that looks like this, and then you have another object that looks like this, it looks like this second object takes up more space, more physical space than this first object does. It looks like it has a larger volume."
Math,"But how do we actually measure that? And remember, volume is just how much space something takes up in three dimensions. Area is how much space something takes up in two dimensions. Length is how much space something takes up in one dimension. But when we think about space, we're normally thinking about three dimensions."
Math,"So how much space would you take up in the world that we live in? So just like we did before, we can define, instead of a unit length or unit area, we can define a unit volume or unit cube. So let's do that. Let's define our unit cube. And here, it's a cube so its length, width, and height are going to be the same value. So my best attempt at drawing a cube. And they're all going to be one unit. So it's going to be one unit high, one unit deep, and one unit wide."
Math,"And so to measure volume, we could say, well, how many of these unit cubes can fit into these different shapes? Well, this one right over here, and you won't be able to actually see all of them. I could essentially break it down into-- so let me see how well I can do this so that we can count them all. It's a little bit harder to see them all because there's some cubes that are behind us. But if you think of it as two layers, so one layer would look like this. One layer is going to look like this."
Math,"So imagine two things like this stacked on top of each other. So this one's going to have 1, 2, 3, 4 cubes. Now, this is going to have two of these stacked on top of each other. So here you have 8 unit cubes. Or you could have 8 units cubed volume. What about here? If we try to fit it all in-- let me see how well I could draw this. It's going to look something like this. And obviously, this is kind of a rough drawing."
Math,"And so if we were to try to take this apart, you would essentially have a stack of three sections that would each look something like this. My best attempt at drawing it. Three sections that would look something like what I'm about to draw. So it would look like this. So if you took three of these and stacked them on top of each other, you'd get this right over here. And each of these have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 cubes in it. 9 times 3, you're going to have 27 cubic units in this one right over here."
Math,"So hopefully that helps us think a little bit about how we measure things especially how we measure things in different number of dimensions, especially in three dimensions when we call it volume.."
Math,"And here we're talking about cubic feet. And when they say that each cube is a cubic foot, they're saying that each of these little boxes, each of these cubes here, is exactly a 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 foot cube. We're in three dimensions right now. We're talking about three dimensions. 3D, you literally need three dimensions. You need how tall you are, how wide you are, and how deep you are. And for a cubic foot, each of those dimensions is one. So each of these are one cubic foot."
Math,"The entire shape has one, two, three, four, five, six cubic feet in it. So the volume of this entire box is 6 cubic feet. And you see right here the unit says feet, and it has a superscript here of 3. This is feet to the third power. You could view this as feet times feet times feet, or cubic feet. So this is 6 cubic feet. Let's do a few more of these. What is the volume of this shape? So this one is quite interesting right over here. You have-- let's see if we can count these."
Math,"So you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight unit boxes, or I guess these are cubic inches for this example. So we have 8 cubic inches. This is a lot of fun, especially when we get to rotate it. So here, each cube is a cubic foot again. So we have one, two, three cubic feet. Let's do one more of these. I like the ones that have these kind of crazy shapes that we have to rotate to be able to see all the boxes."
Math,"So each of these is a cubic meter, which means that in each dimension, each of these boxes is a 1 by 1 by 1 meter. But how many boxes are there? Let's see. We have one. We have one. Let me see if I can get a view where I can look at it better. We have one, two, three, four, five, six boxes. So the total volume here is 6 cubic meters.."
Math,"And I'm defining my unit cube as being a 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter cube. It has 1 centimeter width, 1 centimeter depth, 1 centimeter height. And I will call this, this is equal to 1 cubic centimeter. So I want to measure this volume in terms of cubic centimeters."
Math,"We've already seen that we can do that by saying, hey, how many of these cubic centimeters can fit into this figure without them overlapping in any way? So if we had this in our hands, we could kind of try to go around it and try to count it, but it's hard to see here because there's some cubes that we can't see behind the ones that we are seeing. So I'm going to try different tactics at it. So first, let's just think about what we can observe."
Math,"So we see that this one, if we measure its different dimensions, its width, it's 2 of the unit length wide. So it's 2 centimeters wide. It's 4 of our unit length-- we're defining our unit length as a centimeter-- it's 4 of our unit length high. So this dimension right over here is 4 centimeters. And it is 3 of our unit length deep. So this dimension right over here is 3 centimeters."
Math,"So I want to explore if we can somehow use these numbers to figure out how many of these cubic centimeters would fit into this figure. And the first way I'm going to think about it is by looking at slices. So I'm going to take this slice right over here of our original figure. And let's think about how using these numbers, we can figure out how many unit cubes were in that slice. Well this is 2 centimeters wide and it is 4 centimeters high. And you might be saying, hey Sal, I could just count these things."
Math,"I could get 8 squares here. But what if there was a ton there? It would be a lot harder. And you might realize well I could just multiply the width times the height, that would give me the area of this surface right over here. And it's only 1 deep so that also will give me the number of cubes. So let's do that. Let's find the area here. Well that's going to be 2 centimeters times 4 centimeters. That gives us the area of this."
Math,"And then if we want to find out the number of cubes, well that's also going to be equivalent to the number of cubes. So we have 8 square centimeters is this area, and the number of cubes is 8. And if we want the number of cubes in the whole thing, we just have to multiply by the number of slices. And we see that we need one, two, three slices. This is 3 centimeters deep. So we're going to multiply that times 3. So we took the area of one surface. We took the area of this surface right over here."
Math,"And then we multiply by the depth, that essentially gives us the number of cubes because the area of this surface gives us the number of cubes in an slice that is 1 cube deep. And then we would have to have 3 slices like that. So we would have to have this is 1 slice. We would have to have another slice, another slice and then another slice in order to construct the original figure. So 2 centimeters times 4 centimeters times 3 centimeters would give us our volume. Let's see if that works out."
Math,"2 times 4 is 8 times 3 is 24. Let me do that in that pink color. 24 centimeters cubed, or I could say cubic centimeters. So that's one way to measure the volume. Now there's multiple surfaces here. I happened to pick this surface, but I could have picked another one. I could have picked this surface right over here and done the exact same thing. So let's pick this surface and do the exact same thing. This surface is 3 centimeters by 4 centimeters. Let me do that in that blue color."
Math,"Color changing is always difficult. So its area is going to be 12 square centimeters is the area of this surface. And 12 is also the number of cubes that we have in that slice. And so how many slices do we need like this in order to construct the original figure? Well we need, it's 2 centimeters deep. This is only 1 centimeter deep so we need two of them to construct the original figure."
Math,"So we can essentially find the area of that first surface which was 3 times 4, and then multiply that times the width, times how many of those slices you need, so times 2. And once again, this is going to be 3 times 4 is 12 times 2 is 24. I didn't write the units this first time. But that's going to give us the count of how many cubic centimeters we have, how many unit cubes we can fit. So once again, this is 24 cubic centimeters."
Math,"And you could imagine, you could do the same thing, not with this surface, not with this surface, but with the top surface. The top surface is 3 centimeters deep. And 2 centimeters wide. So you could view its area or its area is going to be 3 centimeters times 2 centimeters. So that area is-- let me do it in the same colors-- 3 centimeters times 2 centimeters which is 6 square centimeters. And that also tells you that there's going to be 6 cubes in this one cube deep slice."
Math,"But how many of these slices do you need? Well you have this whole thing is 4 centimeters tall, and this thing is only 1 centimeter so you're going to need four of them. So that's 2, 3, try to draw it as neatly as I can, and 4. You're going to need 4 of these. So to figure out the whole volume, you going to have to take that and multiply that times 4 centimeters. So once again, 3 times 2 is 6 square centimeters times 4 centimeters is 24 cubic centimeters."
Math,So it doesn't matter what order you multiply these in. You could view this and take the area of one side then multiply it times the depth. Or you could take the surface area of another height and multiply it times the height or the width or the depth. And these are all the scenarios. But what it shows is that it doesn't matter what order we multiply these three dimensions in. You could take the 2 times the 4 first and then multiply it by the 3.
Math,"Or you take the 3 times the 4 first and then multiply it by the 2. And or you could take the 2 times the 3 first, and then multiply by the 4. When you're multiplying, it doesn't matter what order you're doing these in."
Math,"And so if you have a rectangular prism like this and you know it's three dimensions, you know it's 2 centimeters wide, 3 centimeters deep, and 4 centimeters tall, you could say, hey, the volume of this thing, the number of unit cubes, the number of cubic centimeters it can fit is going to be 2 centimeters times 4 centimeters times 3 centimeters, which we've seen three times already is 24 cubic centimeters.."
Math,"And here it looks like everything's being measured in meters. So we want to measure our volume in terms of cubic meters. That's going to be our unit cube here. So when we want to think about how many cubic meters could fit in this box, we've already seen examples. You really just have to multiply the three different dimensions of this box."
Math,"So if you wanted the number of cubic meters that could fit in here, it's going to be six meters times 8 meters times 7 meters which is going to give you something in cubic meters. So let's think about what that is. 6 times 8 is 48. Let me see if I can do this in my head. 48 times 7, that's 40 times 7, which is going to be 280 plus 8 times 7, which is 56, 280 plus 56 is going to be 336. Let's check our answer. Let's do one more of these."
Math,"So what's the volume of this box? We'll once again, we have its height at six feet. Now everything is being measured in feet. We have it's width being four feet. So we could multiple the height times the width of four feet. And then we can multiply that times its depth of two feet. So 6 times 4 is 24 times 2 is 48 feet. 48, and I should say cubic feet."
Math,"We're saying how many cubic feet can fit in here? When we multiply the various dimensions measured in feet, we're counting almost how many of those cubic feet can fit into this box.."
Math,"And so like always, pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Well there's a bunch of ways to do this, but the way I'd like to do it is just to break it up into two rectangular prisms. So what I'm gonna do is, in fact most of the reasonable ways to do this would be to break it up into two rectangular prisms, and the ones that jump out at me is one prism like this that is three centimeters wide, five centimeters high, and then it is seven centimeters long, or seven centimeters deep."
Math,"So this one right over here. And if this part right over here was transparent you would see it look just like this. You would see it look just like this. And so this one once again, it is three centimeters wide, seven centimeters long. So this distance right over here is going to be the same as this distance right over here. So seven centimeters long. So the width times the length times the height is five centimeters. Gets us to, let's see."
Math,"Three times seven is 21, times five is equal to, 20 times five is 100, one times five is five. So it's going to be 105. We can say 105 cubic centimeters, cause you have centimeters times centimeters times centimeters. So this blue part right over here, this blue rectangular prism, has a volume of 105 cubic centimeters. So now we can separately figure out the volume of what I'm now highlighting in this magenta color. What I'm highlighting in this magenta color."
Math,"If this was transparent, you would see this part back over here and right over here. So what are its dimensions? Well, we know its height is two centimeters, we know that this dimension right over here, I guess you could say its depth, we could call it that, is seven centimeters. But what is this right over here? If we want to consider this, maybe it's length, or maybe it's width, depending on what we want to call it."
Math,"Well, let's see, this whole thing is 12 centimeters, from here to here is 12 centimeters, and we know that from here to here is three centimeters, so this piece right over here must be nine centimeters. So that must be nine centimeters, is this distance right over here. So the volume of this magenta part is going to be nine centimeters times seven centimers times the height, times two centimeters."
Math,"Which is going to get us, let's see, nine times seven is 63, 63 times two is equal to, 60 times two is 120, three times two is six, so it's 126 cubic centimeters. So the total volume of the entire thing is going to be the volume of the magenta stuff, which is 126 cubic centimeters, plus the volume of the blue stuff, plus 105 cubic centimeters. And that's going to give us, for the entire figure, six plus five is 11, so one plus two is three, that's really one ten plus two tens is three tens."
Math,"And then 100 plus 100 is 200, so we get 231 cubic centimeters is the volume of the entire thing. Fascinating.."
Math,"What is the volume of the water in the tank? So let's think about this. We have a water tank. It's 12 feet high. I'll try to draw this as good as I can. So it's 12 feet high. It's 5 feet long. So this looks like that's about 5 feet. And it's 9 feet wide. So this is my best rendition of what a tank looks like. So the tank might look something like this. That is my water tank. Let me draw it, draw the whole thing. So there is my water tank."
Math,"And I'm going to make it transparent so that we can see what's going on inside of the tank. So here we go. There's like a helicopter outside or something, I don't know if you all hear that. But let's see. So there is my water tank 12 feet high, 5 feet long, and 9 feet wide. And then they say there's a solid metal box which is 7 feet high, 4 feet long, and 8 feet wide sitting at the bottom. So let's see if I can draw that. So let's say it's 4 feet wide. Or I guess they say 4 feet long, 7 feet high."
Math,"So let's see, 4 feet might look something like this. It's 7 feet high, which might look something like that. 7 feet high. Obviously, I'm not drawing it perfectly to scale. 7 feet high and 8 feet wide. So it might look something like this as it's sitting in this tank. So this is that metal box. And they say it's a solid metal box. It's not like any water can fit in here. So let me make it as a solid metal box. So this is a solid metal box. And then I'm going to fill the whole thing with water."
Math,"I'm going to pour water into this thing. And the water's going to start filling up. And it's going to fill up all the volume of the tank except where the metal box is. It's not going to be able to fill in that volume because the metal box is solid. So it's going to fill up. We're going to fill it, slowly fill this thing up around the metal box. So what's the volume that it's going to fill up? Well, it's going to fill up the volume of the tank minus the volume of the metal box."
Math,"It couldn't fill in the metal box volume. So let's figure out what that is. The volume of the tank is going to be 9 foot by 5 foot times 12 feet. That's the volume of the tank. Tank volume. And from that, we want to subtract the metal box volume. So minus 4 foot by 8 feet by 7 feet. This is 4 feet wide. It is 8 feet-- they say it's 7 feet high. It's 4 feet long. And it's 8 feet wide. So this right over here is the volume. I guess we could call it the metal box volume."
Math,"When you take the tank volume and subtract out the box volume, that's how much the water can actually fill in. So I only drew the water partially filled. But once it's already filled in, the water is going to go all the way to the top here. And we'll fill in everything except for where that blue box is. So let's figure out what this value is. So 5 times 12 is 60. 60 times 9 is 540. And then in blue here, let's see. 4 times 8 is 32. 32 times 7 is 210. Plus 14, which is 224. So it's minus 224. Minus 224."
Math,"Did I do that right? I don't want to make a careless mistake? So 32 times 7. 2 times 7 is 14. 3, which is really a 30 here. 30 times 7 is 210. Plus another 10 is 220. So 224. So this is going to be equal to-- let's see. 500 minus 200 is 300. And then 40 minus 24 is 16. And our units are in cubic feet. So the volume of the water in the tank? 316 cubic feet.."
Math,"So for example, you might have the two numbers three, comma five. How can these two numbers be represented as a point on the plane, or how can these tell you where a point on the plane is? So let's first get a little bit of terminology out of the way. So what we have here, this is often known as our coordinate plane. These two numbers you could view as our coordinates. Let me write this down. These are coordinates. These black lines are known as the axes."
Math,"Each one is an axis and the one that goes left right here, this is known as the X axis, or it's typically known as the X axis. In the future it might be called other things, and the one that goes up down in the vertical direction, this is typically known as the Y axis. As you go further in math we might call it other things, but most of the time it's going to be called the Y axis."
Math,"So how does three comma five, how do these coordinates specify a point on this plane? Well the way that we typically work it through, the standard way that people will interpret these points, it'll say all right, this first coordinate, this is our X coordinate. This is our X coordinate. You can view it as how far do we move to the right along the X axis. So what you would do is you'd say all right I'm gonna start right here where my axes intersect and I'm gonna go three to the right. One, two, three."
Math,"So my X coordinate says, all right my point is going to be this far to the right. This far to the right. So it's gonna be somewhere on this vertical line. This dotted line that I'm showing. Everything on this vertical line has an X coordinate of three. Now what's the Y coordinate? Another way I should say it, the second number right over here. This is the Y coordinate. Y coordinate. This tells us how far do we move up. So one way to think about it, you could start back where the axes intersect."
Math,"This point is actually called the origin. Let me write that down. That is the origin, and so starting at the origin, move five up. One, two, three, four, five. So everything on this horizontal line that I'm drawing has a Y coordinate of five. So what point uniquely has both an X coordinate of three and a Y coordinate of five? Well you can see where those two lines intersect, right over here. Actually let me do that same blue color that I wrote the coordinates in."
Math,"So this point right over here, it has an X coordinate of three, and it has a Y coordinate of five. That is the point three comma five. Now what is the coordinate of the origin? Well the origin is zero to the right of the origin and it's also zero above the origin. So the coordinates there, the X coordinate is zero, the Y coordinate is also zero. Let's do a few more examples. So let's say that I wanted to plot the point two comma five. Why don't you pause this. Oh let me use a different number."
Math,"Two comma four. Why don't you pause this video and think about where that point would be on this coordinate plane. All right let's do it together. So the first number is going to be our X coordinate. It tells us how far do we move to the right. So we move two to the right, and then our second number says how far do we move up. So first we're gonna move two to the right and then we are going to move four up. So you can say one two to the right and then one two three four right over there."
Math,"This right over here is the point two comma four. Notice is X coordinate. How far to the right of the origin it is. That is two and its Y coordinate, how far above the origin is. That is four. Now let's go the other way around. Let's say that I were to give you, if I were to give you this point right over here. What would its coordinates be? Pause the video and try to figure that out. All right, well we know it's gonna be two numbers. So I'll do something comma something."
Math,"Now the first something, that's going to be our X coordinate. You could think of it, what point on the X axis are we above? You could think about how far to the right of the origin we are, and you can see that your X coordinate right over here is if we just drop a vertical line straight down from that point it hits the X axis at four. So that is four. Another way to think about it we're one two three four to the right of the Y axis."
Math,"Now how high are we? How high above the X axis are we? Well we're one above the X asis. So this is gonna be four comma one. Another way to think about it, if you just take a line and you go straight to the left you're going to hit the Y axis at the one right over here. So the coordinates here are four comma one. Now just so we don't get confused, and when you first learn this, the main point of confusion is remembering that okay the first number is the X coordinate, the second number is the Y coordinate."
Math,One comma four would be a different point. One comma four would be okay one in the X direction and then four in the Y direction. So this is one comma four over here.
Math,"So it's very important to realize that the standard way of interpreting these numbers is that the first one says how far do you move to the right of the origin, or how far do you move along the X axis or where are you on the X axis, and the second number is how far do you move in the vertical direction, or where are you relative to the Y, or where are you in the vertical direction?."
Math,"It's a positive 8, so we move 8 in the x direction. And then the second number in our ordered pair is 10. That is our y-coordinate. That tells us how far we move in the y direction. Since it's positive, we move up 10. So we move up 10, all the way over here. And you could have thought about it either way. You could have said, hey, look this is our y-coordinate. This is 10. So I could move up 10. And then my x-coordinate is positive 8. So I'll move 8 along the positive x-axis, or I'll move 8 to the right."
Math,"You see right over here I have moved 8 to the right-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And I have moved 10 up-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. You might be tempted to move 8 up and then 10 to the right, which would put you there. But then you would have had the two numbers mixed up. You would have had the x and the y-coordinates mixed up. The 8 tells you how far to move in the horizontal direction. The 10 tells you how far to move in the vertical direction. Let's do a couple more of these. Plot 6 comma 10."
Math,"Well once again, the first number in the ordered pair is the x-coordinate, how far we move in the x direction. So we move 6 to the right. And then the second number, the 10, tells us our vertical coordinate, our y-coordinate. So it's positive 10. So we move 10 up. Let's do one more-- 5 comma 7. So my horizontal coordinate is 5, so I move 5 to the right. And then my vertical one is 7, or my y-coordinate is 7. So I move 7 up-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
Math,"And as long as you remember which one is horizontal and which one is vertical or which one is the x-coordinate and which one is the y, you should be fine. You could say, hey look, this is my y-coordinate, 7. So I'm going to move 7 up. And my x-coordinate is 5, so I'm going to move 5 to the right. And it will get you to that exact same point. This specifies exactly one point in the coordinate plane.."
Math,"Plot her home and school on the map. How many blocks does Naomi walk to school? So let's plot her home first, 2nd Avenue and 3rd Street, which they are giving us the coordinates 2, 3. So the x-axis right over here, this is representing the avenues. And then the y-axis, or the vertical axis, this represents the street. So 2, 3. So this right over here is 2nd Avenue and 3rd Street. So you see here, we went to 2nd Avenue and then we went up to 3rd Street. This is where she lives at home."
Math,"We could have also said 3rd Street and 2nd Avenue. Now her school is a 4th Avenue and 10th street. And now we're going to go, so if we start at the origin, we go to 4th Avenue and then go up 10 to 10th Street. So this is the coordinate 4, 10. So this is where our home is. This is where a school is. They say she walks over to 4th Avenue and up to 10th Street. So she walks from 2nd Avenue to 4th Avenue and then up to 10th Street."
Math,"How many blocks does Naomi walk to school? Well as she walks from 2nd Avenue to 4th Avenue, she's going to walk 2 blocks. 1 block and 2 blocks. You shouldn't get confused by they're actually marking off with these lines every half a block. So that's 1 block to 3rd Avenue, 2 blocks to 4th Avenue. So that's 2 blocks so far. And then she goes from 3rd Street to 10th Street. Well, if you go from 3rd Street to 10th Street, that's going to be 7 more blocks. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
Math,So 2 in the horizontal direction and then 7 in the vertical direction. So that's 9 total blocks..
Math,"So, for example, it looks like Liu Yang did zero hours of exercise, did no exercise and spent seven hours in front of a screen. Not something that I would recommend. And it looks like Kavitha spent half an hour, had half an hour of exercise on Thursday. This is all describing what happens on Thursday and had five and a half hours of screen time. You see that right over there, and we could keep going with all the other data points. But let's see what they're asking us."
Math,"What is the meaning of the point marked Maxime? I think that's how I would pronounce that. So, Maxime is right over here, and it looks like this is the point one, because our horizontal coordinate right over here is one, and then our vertical coordinate is four, so point one comma four. And this one is the hours of exercise. So, Maxime exercises one hour, one hour exercise, and they spend four hours in front of a screen on that Thursday, four hours screen time. Alright, so let's see."
Math,"Which of these choices say that? Let's see. It is Maxime had one hour of exercise and four hours of screen time. Yep, this looks exactly right. And if you just wanted to check the other ones, Maxime had two hours of exercise and eight hours of screen time. That would put them way up here, and that's not where the point was, so we'd rule that out. Maxime had four hours of exercise and one hour of screen time."
Math,"Four hours of exercise is not even on this, we'd have to go off the screen, so we'd rule that one out. Maxime had five hours of exercise. Once again, that's not even on the screen here, so we can rule all of them out. This third choice, they're actually trying to confuse you because they're swapping the hours of exercise and the screen time. Maxime has one hour of exercise, four hours of screen time, not four hours of exercise and one hour of screen time.."
Math,So let's think about what's going on. So he already had 5 marbles in his pocket. And then he found 4 more marbles to add to that. So we can add the 4 marbles to the 5 marbles. So 4 marbles plus the 5 marbles. So that's what happens after the first sentence. He found 4 marbles to add to his 5 marbles currently in his pocket. He then had a competition with his friends and tripled his marbles. So this is how many marbles he had before tripling. And now he's tripling his marbles.
Math,"So we want to multiply 3 times the total number of marbles he has now-- times 4 plus 5. So this right over here is the numerical expression that models the situation without performing any operations. We, of course, could then actually calculate this. He has 9 marbles before tripling. And then you multiply it by 3 and he has 27. But this is what they're asking for. They want us to write this expression.."
Math,"And so here we have 8 minus 3, which is equal to 5. So this simplifies to 5 times 5 times 8 minus 3. And now we want to do the multiplication before we do subtraction. This goes back to order of operations. You do your multiplication and division first. Well, you do your parentheses first. Then if you have multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction all in a row, you want to do your multiplication and your division first."
Math,"So here we're going to multiply 5 times 8 to get 40, and then we're going to subtract 3 to get 37. Now, let's think about what this would evaluate to if we did not have the parentheses. So it would be 8 minus 3 times 8 minus 3. So we just have to remind ourselves about the order of operations. The convention is to do your multiplication first. So you're actually going to multiply the 3 times the 8 before you subtract it from this 8 and then before you subtract this 3."
Math,"So we took away the parentheses, but the order of operations say, hey, do this multiplication first. We could even put a parentheses here to emphasize that. So this will become 8 minus 8 minus 24. Let me write it this way. 8 minus 24 minus 3. 8 minus 24 minus 3. Now, 8 minus 24 is negative 16. You subtract another 3, you're going to get to negative 19. So clearly, you get very, very different values depending on whether or not you have parentheses.."
Math,"So this first one says 700 minus 19, divided in half. So we could say, another way to think about divided in half is divided by two, so we could write this as 709 minus 19, and we're going to do that first, so that's why I put the parentheses around it, divided by two, or divided in half. That's one way that we could write this. Now the next one, and once again, pause it if you get inspired, and I encourage you to. Three times the sum of 56 and seven. So it's gonna be three times the sum of 56 and seven."
Math,"So the sum of 56 and seven, we want to take that first, so it's going to be 56 plus the seven, that's the sum of 56 and seven, and then we want to do three times that. We want to do three times this sum. So we could write it like that."
Math,"Another way we could write it, when you're dealing with parentheses, and you're going to see this more and more as you get into more and more fancy algebra, I guess you could say, but what I'm about to show you isn't so fancy, is, you don't have to write the multiplication sign here. You could just write three, and then open parentheses, 56 plus seven, and this, too, is three times the sum of 56 and seven."
Math,"And you want to be very careful, because you might be tempted to maybe do it without the parentheses, so you might be tempted to do something like this, three times 56 plus seven, but this one isn't, obviously, three times the sum of 56 and seven. In fact, the standard way to interpret this is that you would do the multiplication first. You would do three times 56, and then add seven, which is going to give you a different value, and you could try it out, than if you were to add the 56 and the seven first."
Math,"So, to make sure that you do the 56 and the seven first, you want to put this parentheses around it. So let's keep going. The sum of three times 56 and seven. So we're gonna take the sum of two things. The first thing that we're gonna take the sum of is three times 56. So, three times 56, and seven. Let me do that in a different color. And seven. So this right over here is the sum of three times 56, and seven. Now it's always good to write the parentheses."
Math,"It makes it a little bit cleaner, a little bit more obvious. Look, I'm gonna take the three times 56, I'm gonna do that first, and then I'm gonna add seven, but based on what I just told you, the standard way, if someone were to just write three times 56 plus seven, this actually can still be interpreted as the sum of three times 56, and seven, because as I just said, the standard, the convention, so to speak, is to do your multiplication first."
Math,"Order of operations, which you may or may not, if you're not familiar, you will be familiar with it soon, is to do the multiplication first, and then add the seven, or then do the addition. But just to make it clear, it doesn't hurt to put the parentheses there. Three times 56, plus seven. Now we have 43 minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, 43 minus, so we're gonna have 43 minus, minus the sum of 16 and 11. So, minus the sum of 16 and 11."
Math,"So, from 43, we're gonna take the sum of 16 and 11, and so, once again, the parentheses make it clear that we're going to take the sum of 16 and 11, and we're gonna take that from 43. The parentheses are very, very, very important here, because if we just did 43 minus 16 plus 11, the standard way of interpreting this would be 43 minus 16, and then adding 11, which would give you a different value than 43 minus the sum of 16 and 11."
Math,"So once again, the parentheses are very, very, very important here to make it clear that you're gonna add the 16 and 11 first, and then subtract that sum from 43. This is fun, let's keep going. 10 times the quotient of 104 and eight. So, we're gonna do 10 times something."
Math,"10 times the quotient of 104 and eight, and so the quotient of 104 and 8 we could write like this, divided by eight, or, based on what we told you a little earlier, you could write this as 10 times the quotient of 104 and eight, or 104 divided by eight. Now let's just do this last one. Four times as large as the expression 175 minus 58. So I'm gonna do four times as large as something, so I'm gonna multiply something times four. It's four times as large as the expression 175 minus 58."
Math,"And once again, I could write it as four times as large as the expression, let me do that in that purple color, as the expression minus 58. Either way, and once again, if you were to do it like this, if you didn't write the parentheses, then, it wouldn't be the same thing, 'cause if the parentheses weren't here, then you would want to do the four times 175 first, and then subtract the 58, which isn't what this statement is telling us."
Math,"And this last one, I think, brings up an interesting thing for us to think about, because if someone were to walk up to you on the street, and they were to show you-- Whoops, what's going on with my computer? And they were to show you two different expressions. Well, the first expression said two-- Let's write it this way, actually, I'm not gonna even speak 'em out. I'm just gonna write it down. I'm just gonna write some crazy number here. Some crazy numbers here."
Math,"So that's one expression that someone were to write, and let's say another one is this one, and I'm intentionally-- What, I put the commas in the wrong place. Let me make sure I get this right. Alright, that's 183,576. This is 37,399. So that's one expression, and then another expression is this. And I'm intentionally not reading it out. Well, I'll read it out a little bit, 37,399."
Math,"And someone said, ""Quick! ""Which expression is larger?"" And you might be tempted, or you might not be tempted, but you might be tempted, ""Oh, let me calculate this thing."
Math,"""Gee, I'm gonna have to write this thing down, ""or use a calculator or something, ""or whatever else to add ""183,576 ""plus 37,399, ""and then I'm gonna have to multiply that by two, ""and figure out what that number is equal to, ""and then I would have to take ""183,576 plus 37,399 ""and figure out what that is, ""multiply that by seven, ""and figure out what that's going to be. ""That's hard! ""That's gonna take--"" Not hard, it's just gonna take you some time, you might make some careless mistakes."
Math,"But the big realization to say, ""Well, which one is larger? ""Well I don't have to even calculate these things!"" 'Cause this is two times this craziness right over here, this thing that's gonna be 200 something thousand, and this is seven times that thing that is going to be 200 and something thousand."
Math,"So seven times that thing is going to be larger than two times that thing, and so, one way to-- Before you dive deep, and start computing things, it's always good to take a step back and say, ""Hey, look, can I look at how the expressions are formed, ""the structure of these expressions?"" And say, ""Look, this is two times this thing, ""and this is seven times this thing."" Well, the seven is going to be, this one right over here is going to be a larger expression."
Math,"Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that as much as I did.."
Math,"So for every term in Pattern A, we want to multiply by 3 and 1. So if we multiply 0 by 3, we get 0. And you add 1, you get 1. If you multiply 1 by 3, you get 3. And then you add 1, you get 4. 2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10. Remember, we're just multiplying by 3 and adding 1. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So those are the corresponding terms for Pattern B. And then they ask us to graph them. So let's try to graph these points. So when Pattern A is 0, Pattern B is 1."
Math,"When Pattern A is 0-- so this is Pattern A equaling 0. That's our horizontal axis, the value of Pattern A-- Pattern B is the value of our vertical axis. Pattern B is 1. When Pattern A is 1, Pattern B is 4. So when Pattern A is 1, Pattern B is 4. Pattern B is on the vertical axis. When Pattern A is 2, Pattern B is 7. When Pattern A is 3, Pattern B is 10, so 3 in the horizontal direction. That's our Pattern A value. And our Pattern B value is 10. And then, finally, when Pattern A is 4, Pattern B is 13."
Math,"Now, let's just look at these patterns. We see Pattern A is increasing by 1 each time, while Pattern B is increasing by it's-- well, Pattern A starts at 0 and increases by 1, while Pattern B starts at 1 and increases by 3, which makes complete sense. It makes sense that it starts at 1, because all of these, you multiply by 3 and add 1. So you start at 1. And then, the fact that we're multiplying by 3, that's what's leading to the distance between these points being 3."
Math,"So let's check our answer to make sure we got this right, and we did.."
Math,"So here, for each point, this point right over here, this represents its horizontal coordinate is the first term of pattern A, which is 4. And its vertical coordinate is the first term in pattern B, which is 1. And then we could do that for the other points as well. So actually, let's figure out what the values are. So we have pattern A and then we have pattern B. So the first term for pattern A is 4. And when pattern A is 4, the first term for pattern B is 1. The second term for pattern A is 7."
Math,"And when pattern A is 7, pattern B is also 7. Third term, pattern A is 10, and pattern B is 13. And then the fourth term, pattern A is 13, and pattern B is 19. And then finally, fifth term, pattern A is 16, and pattern B is 25. Now, before even looking at these, let's see what we can think about these patterns here. So it looks like pattern A starts at 4, and it increases by 3 every time. To go from one term to the next, you just have to add 3."
Math,"Now, what about for pattern B? Well pattern B starts at 1, and every term here it looks like you're adding 6. So when pattern A increases by 3 and we're moving in the horizontal direction based on the fact that pattern A is represented on the horizontal axis, we're going to move up 6 in the vertical axis, and we see that here. Pattern A increases by 3 from one term to the next. And when that increased by 3, pattern B increased by 6 from one term to the next. And we see that it keeps doing that."
Math,"Now, let's think about what we have over here to see which of these statements actually apply to this. For every term in pattern A, multiply the term by 2 and then subtract 7 to get the corresponding term from pattern B. So let's see if that holds up. So according to this, if this was true, I should be able to take this, multiply it by 2 and subtract 7 and get that. So let's see. Is 1 equal to 2 times 8 minus 7? Sorry, 2 times 4 minus 7. So 2 times this number, 2 times 4 minus 7."
Math,"Well, 8 minus 7 is equal to 1. Is this right over here equal to 2 times this 7 minus 7? Well, yeah, it's equal to 7. Is 13 equal to 2 times 10 minus 7? Well, yeah, 20 minus 7 is 13. Is 19 equal to 2 times 13 minus 7? 26 minus 7 is 19. Is 25 equal to 2 times 16 minus 7? Well, 32 minus 7 is 25. So this first statement checks out. For the corresponding term, the value of pattern B is two times the value of pattern A minus 7. Now let's look at the second one."
Math,"The terms of pattern B are always greater than or equal to their corresponding terms from pattern A. Well, no, that's not right. It's true for a couple of scenarios. Here for the third, fourth, and fifth term, or actually for the second, third, fourth, and fifth terms, pattern B is equal to or greater than pattern A. But for the first term, it's not true. Pattern A is greater, so this is not right. To get from each point to the next, you need to move 3 units to the right and 6 units up."
Math,"Well, that's exactly what we talked about. From one term to the next, pattern A, along our horizontal axis, we increased by 3, while pattern B, which is plotted on our vertical axis, So you move 3 to the right and 6 up. So that is right. The second terms of both patterns are 7. Well, yeah, we see that right over here. The second terms are 7. We have 7 here, and we have 7 there. And so that is right as well. So the only one that doesn't apply is this second one. This is not right.."
Math,"box, there are different statements about the two patterns. Choose all correct statements. So let's think about what's going on here. They said the first term is pattern A. So the first term in each of these coordinates is pattern A, or in each pair is pattern A. So pattern A goes from 1, to 2, to 4, to 8, to 16, to 32. So it looks like pattern A, to go from the first term to the second term, we multiplied by 2. And then to go from the second to the third term, we also multiplied by 2."
Math,"And we just keep multiplying by 2. And we just keep doing that. 8 times 2 is 16. 16 times 2 is 32. Now let's think about what's going on with pattern B. So pattern B is the second number in each of these pairs. And it's just always 3. So there's a couple of ways you can think about it. You could just say, pattern B's always 3. You could say pattern B starts at 3, and we're just adding 0 every time. Or you could say that pattern B starts at 3, and we are multiplying by 1 every time."
Math,"Either of those would give you just 3 showing up over and over again. So now that we've looked at these pairs, we show the corresponding terms for pattern A and pattern B, let's look at the choices here and see which of these apply. In pattern A, you can get from any term to the next by multiplying by a constant number. Well, that looks right. We go from the first term to the second term by multiplying by 2. Then we multiply by 2 again to get to the third term. Then we keep multiplying by 2."
Math,"So that constant number that we're multiplying by to get to the next term is 2. So this looks right. The next pair should be 52 comma 3. So let's think about this. If we keep doubling for pattern A-- so this is going to be times 2. 32 times 2 is 64. And then if we'd say that this is 1 times the previous term, we're just going to get a 3 again. So it should be 64 comma 3 should be the next one. They say the next pair should be 52 comma 3. So that's not right."
Math,"If we graph the pairs, the points will be on the same line. So let's think about that a little bit. Let's think about that. So this is my vertical axis. This is my horizontal axis. On the horizontal axis, I will graph pattern A. And on my vertical axis, I will graph pattern B. And let's see. Pattern A goes all the way up to 32. So I'm going to try my best here. So let's say that this is 32. Then half of that is going to be 16. Half of that is going to be 8. Half of that is going to be 4."
Math,"Half of that is going to be 2. And half of that is going to be 1. So these are all the points on pattern A. But for any of them, the corresponding term on pattern B is 3. So we have, when pattern A is 1, pattern B is 3-- 1,3. When pattern A is 2, pattern B is 3. When pattern A is 4, pattern B is 3. When pattern A is 8, pattern B is 3. When pattern A is 16, pattern-- this is like a tongue-- when pattern A is 16, pattern B is 3. When pattern A is 32, pattern B is 3. And you see, they all sit on a line."
Math,"They all sit on this horizontal line, or at least the way that we've drawn it. They all sit on this line that you probably can't see in yellow. So let me do it in this red color. They all sit on this line right over here. So this looks right. If we graph the pairs, the points will be on the same line. So I'll go with that one. In pattern B, you can get from any term to the next by multiplying by a constant number."
Math,"Well, yeah, even though every term is the same term, but you can get from a 3 to a 3 by always multiplying by 1. 1 is a constant number. So we're just multiplying every term by 1. So that also seems to be right. So all of these are right, except the second one. The next pair isn't 52 comma 3. It's going to be 64 comma 3.."
Math,"Fill in the table with the first three terms of x and y. Then plot the ordered pairs (x,y) on the graph below. So let's see, Sequence x. They say, the starting number, the starting number should be one. So the starting number is one, and then the rule, to get to the next number, you just add one. So, one plus one is two. Two plus one is three. Fairly straight forward. Now, let's look at Sequence y. They're saying the starting number should be five."
Math,"Starting number five, and then the rule is, to get the next term, we just add five. So, five plus five is ten, ten plus five is fifteen. Now they want us to plot these things. Let's see, we plot them as ordered pairs, so we're going to have the point (1,5). When x is one, y is five. We see that there, x is one, y is five. When x is two, y is ten. When x is two, y is ten, and then when x is three, y is fifteen. When x is three, y is fifteen, and wee see that."
Math,"For every one we move to the right, for every one we increase in the horizontal direction, every one we increase in x, we increase five for y. We increase one for x, we increase five for y. So now we just have one last thing to answer. The terms in Sequence y are blank, times the terms in Sequence x. So you immediately see, this term, five, is five times one. Ten is five times two. Fifteen is five times three, and it makes sense."
Math,"You started five times higher, and here you added one each time, and we see that visually right over here, we add one each time, while here we add five times as much each time. We add five each time. The terms in Sequence y are five times the terms in Sequence x. We got it right.."
Math,"So it's essentially saying, how many groups of 60 minutes can we divide 549 into. Or another way of thinking about that is, well, what is 549 divided into groups of 60. This is how many hours we're going to have. So let's do that. Let's take 549 and divide it by 60. So let's see, 6 goes into 54 9 times. So 60 is going to go into 540 9 times. We're going to have a little bit left over. So we have 9 times 60 is 540. We subtract. We have 9 left over."
Math,"And now let's see, we have a little left over, so we're going to get a decimal. So let's put a decimal place right over here and let's throw some 0's over there. Let's bring down a 0. So we bring down a 0. 60 goes into 90 1 time. 1 times 60 is 60. And we subtract. We get 30. Let's bring down another 0. And so we get to 300. 60 goes into 300 5 times. 5 times 60, 6 times 6 is 30, so 5 times 60 is 300. Subtract and we are done. So you divide 549 into groups of 60."
Math,"You can divide it into 9.15 groups of 60 minutes. A group of 60 minutes is an hour. So this 549 minutes is 9.15 hours. I want to make sure that we can visualize that properly. So let's actually construct what 9.15 hours looks like. So let me draw a little line here, and on the top I'll label Hours, and on the bottom I'll label Minutes. So this is 0 hours, 0 minutes. And now we have 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Now we have 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Then you have 3 hours, which is 180 minutes."
Math,"Then you have 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. 5 hours is 300 minutes. 6 hours is 360 minutes. 7 hours, I might be running out of space, is for 420 minutes. Let me copy and paste this someplace where I have more real estate. So let me clear that. And then let me paste that someplace where I don't run into my other math that I did. All right. So then you have 8 hours is 480 minutes. And then you have 9 hours. Notice, I'm just adding 60 minutes every time. 9 hours is 540 minutes."
Math,"Or another way you could think about it is, well, if each hour is 60, 9 times 60 is 540. And we don't want to go to just 540. We have another 9 left. So then we have to go another 9 minutes to go to 549. So you have 9 minutes left over. So another way of thinking about this, is that 549 is 9 hours. And then you have 9 minutes left over. And 9 minutes is what fraction of an hour? Well, 60 minutes is a whole hour. So 9 minutes is 9/60 of an hour. So you could write it this way. It's 9 and 9/60 hours."
Math,"Or we could write this as an equivalent fraction. 9/60 is the same thing if we divide the numerator and the denominator by 3, is the same thing as 3/20. So we could write this as 9 and 3/20. And 3/20, well we could figure out what that is going to be. Let's see, 20 divided by 3. It's definitely going to be smaller than 1, because 3 is smaller than 20. So let's throw some 0's on here. 20 doesn't go into 3, but it does go into 30 1 time. 1 times 20 is 20. Subtract, we get a 10. Bring down a 0."
Math,"20 goes into 100 5 times. 5 times 20 is 100. And we are done. So notice, 3 over 20 is the exact same thing. So 9 and 3/20 is the exact same thing as 9 and 15/100. These are all equivalent answers.."
Math,"So the way I would tackle this is I would try to convert them all to the same units, maybe meters, and then compare them all in terms of meters. So let's do that. So this is just a screenshot of that exact same screen we just saw there. And so let's just convert each of these into meters. So the first one we have right over here is one decameter. So we have to remind ourselves what deca even means. Well, deca is equal to 10 meters."
Math,"And actually, let me add more of these, just so that we know all the different prefixes we could have. So you have deca. You have hecto, which would be 100. You have kilo, which would be 1,000. And then, of course, you just have meters, and you'd have no prefix there. That would just be equal 1 if you have no prefix in front of the meters. And then if you have a tenth of a meter, that is decimeter, so this is 1/10. Then you have centi, which is 1/100. And then you have milli, which is equal to 1/1,000."
Math,"So let's use this information right over here to figure out how many meters each of these are. So one decameter-- we just saw deca means 10. That's 1 times 10 meters. So this is going to be equal to 10 meters. So this right over here is 10 meters. This is already written in meters. This is 13 meters. Then we have 15,000 millimeters, but milli means 1/1,000, So it's 15,000 times 1/1,000 of a meter. So each millimeter is 1/1,000 of a meter."
Math,"You could view this as instead of writing a milli here, I wrote 1/1,000. So 15,000 times 1/1,000, that's just going to give me 15. So this is going to be 15 meters. So this is 15 meters. Another way of thinking about it is, look, 1,000 millimeters is equal to a meter. So let's divide this into groups of 1,000. Well, this is literally 15 groups of 1,000. This is 15 groups of 1,000 millimeters, so that's going to be 15 meters. And then, finally, we have 1,900 centimeters."
Math,"So 1,900, instead of writing centi, I'm going to write 1/100 of a meter. Well, 1,900 times 1 over 100 is 19, so this is equal to 19 meters. Another way of thinking about it is, this is 19 groups of 100 centimeters, and 100 centimeters is equal to a meter. This is 19 meters right over here. So let's go back to the actual problem. So let's remind ourselves. This right over here, this is 10 meters. This is 13 meters, so 10, 13. This right over here was 15 meters, and this right over here was 19 meters."
Math,"So actually, the order that they already gave it to us in, we could obviously swap things around if we wanted to. But the order that they already gave it to was the order from smallest to largest. This is 10 meters, 13 meters, 15 meters, and 19 meters.."
Math,"37 centimeters, and we want to convert it to meters. So we really just have to remind ourselves what the prefix centi means. Centi literally means 1/100th, or one hundredth of a meter. So this is really saying 37 hundredth meters, so let's write it that way. This is literally 37/100 of a meter. So 1/100 meters. These are equivalent statements. So what are 37/100 of a meter? Well, that's going to be 37/100 of a meter, which can be rewritten as, if you wanted to write it as a decimal, that's 0."
Math,"you could view it as 3/10 and 7/100, or 37/100. So 0.37, 0.37 meters. Another way that you could have thought about this is look, I'm going to go from centimeters to meters. I have 100. I need 100 centimeters to get to one meter, so I'm going to have to divide by 100 in order to figure out how many meters I have. And you should always do a reality check."
Math,"If I convert centimeters to meters, should I get a larger number or a smaller number? Well, however many centimeters I have, I'm going to have a fewer number of meters. Meters is a larger unit. So you should have a smaller value here, and it should be a smaller value by a factor of 100. So you literally could have started off with 37 centimeters. Let me write it this way, 37 centimeters. And actually, let's go through a couple of the units right over here."
Math,"Now, if you wanted to turn it to decimeters, so this is 1/100. Decimeters, one over 1/10. So you would divide. This would be 3.7 decimeters. Let me write this as 3.7 decimeters. And a decimeter is 1/10 of a meter, so you would divide by 10 again. So this is 0.37 meters. So one way to think about it is to go from centimeters to meters, you're going to divide by 100. Dividing by 100, you would move the decimal space over to the left two times. Doing it once divides by 10. Doing it twice divides by 100."
Math,So you get to 0.37 meters..
Math,"So these are just two different systems. You'll get more and more familiar with them. Then indicate whether each unit measures length, weight, mass, or volume. Let's do the first. Let's see which of these are U.S. customary unit versus metric units. So the liter is a metric unit. You would use it in the metric system. A gallon is a U.S. customary unit. We've been dealing with that. If you fill your gasoline in Europe, you're going to be filling it in terms of liters."
Math,"In the U.S., you're going to be filling it in terms of gallons. And we're going to talk about whether they're units of volume and whatnot in a little bit. Decigram, that is metric system. In general, whenever you see these prefixes, deci, centi, kilo, you're dealing with the metric system. No one ever talks about a kilopound. I guess you could, but no one really talks about it. Same thing, millimeter. This is metric system. A gram is metric system. Meter is metric system. The foot is a U.S. customary unit."
Math,"We'll talk about whether it's distance or any of that in a little bit. Kilogram, once again, it is metric units. In case you haven't gotten what I'm doing here, blue for metric, red for U.S. customary units, or I guess magenta. Centiliter, that is metric. Centimeter, meters are metric. And notice we have the prefix in both cases. Centi means 1/100. Cup, that is U.S. customary units. I have to do that in the magenta. Cup, U.S. customary units. Meter, that is the metric system. Pound, U.S. customary units."
Math,"It's getting a little tedious. Inch, same thing, that's what we use in the U.S. Ounce, we use that in the U.S. And then the yard, we also use that in the U.S. Now we've divided them up. All the magenta ones are used in the U.S. All of the blue ones are used really in the rest of the world, and actually some places in the U.S. as well. I think a lot of the world is frustrated that the U.S., that we're not all converted to this because the metric system is actually a little bit more logical."
Math,"It's easy to just figure out what it's saying, and we'll deal with that in more detail in the future. Now the next thing we to figure out is whether something is a measure of length, weight/mass-- and they're not exactly the same thing. Mass is how much of a substance you have. Weight is how much force with which gravity is pulling on that mass. And it would change depending on what planet you're on. But on Earth, they tend to be used interchangeably, so we'll use it roughly interchangeably here."
Math,"And then you have volume, or how much space something takes up. So this is distance. This is moving in one dimension. Mass is how much stuff there is. Weight is how much the force that stuff is pulled on, on a planet, by gravity, or I guess a star anywhere. And volume is how much space does that stuff take up. Now let's think about it. Liter is volume. This right here is volume. How much space do you take up. Gallon is also volume. That's in the U.S."
Math,"And in Europe, or in the metric system, it would be a liter. That's a gram. Gram is a unit of mass. So decigram just means 1/10 of a gram. Millimeter. Meter is a unit. Meter right here, that is the unit of distance or of length. Millimeter, milli means 1/1,000 of a meter. Foot, that is also a unit of length. Kilogram, that just means 1,000 grams. Kilo means a thousand. Gram, we already said, is a unit of mass. Centiliter, that means 1/100 of a liter. Liter, we already figured out, is a unit of volume."
Math,"Centimeter, we already figured out. Meter is a unit of length. Centimeter means 1/100 of a meter. So this is a unit of length. Cup, we've seen multiple times already. It is a unit of volume, how much space does something take up. Meter, that is length. We've seen it multiple times already. Pound, that is actually a unit of weight. An inch is a unit of length. We're all familiar with it. An ounce-- you have to be careful here-- if someone just has an ounce, that is 1/16 of a pound. It as a unit of weight."
Math,"If it was written fluid ounce, then we'd be talking about 1/16 of a pint, and then it would be a unit of volume. But since it's just ounce, it's a unit of weight, 1/16 of a pound. And then finally, a yard is a unit of length. And we are done.."
Math,"How much time will Susan have between the end of the test and the beginning of volleyball practice? Let's think about this a little bit. So the test begins at 1:59. So it's a very strange time to begin a test, but let's just go with that. So let me draw a little time line here. So let's say that this is 2 o'clock PM. Then we're going to have 3:00 PM. Then we're going to have 4 o'clock PM, which is also when volleyball practice begins. So this is volleyball practice."
Math,"It's going to start then and then go on from 4:00 PM. And then the test begins at 1:59. So let me continue the number line. So this right over here is 1:00 PM. So the test is going to begin at 1:59, so 1 minute before 2 PM. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour. So 1:59 is 1 minute before 2:00 PM. So I'm not drawing it completely it scale, but this right over here is 1:59 PM. So we use 1 minute to get to 2:00 PM. And then, let's see, we have to get up to 96 minutes."
Math,"So then you get another 60 minutes to go to 3:00 PM. So, so far, we've used a cumulative 61. So this is 1 minute. So this is how long the test has been going on since the beginning. So 1 minute by 2:00 PM, 61 minutes by 3:00 PM. If we go all the way to 4:00 PM, that's going to be another 60. That'd be 121 minutes, which is longer than the actual test. So we know that the entire test is 96 minutes. So we're going to get to some point right over here, some point like this. That's 96 minutes."
Math,"And what we need to figure out is, is what is left over? What is this distance right over here? Or what is this time, this difference in time right over here? And so to figure that out, we had to figure out the time at which 96 minutes have passed since the beginning of the exam. So at 3 o'clock, 61 minutes have passed. And so if we, if we say well how many more minutes have to go on for the end of the test? It's going to be 96 minus 61."
Math,"So the amount of time that elapses past 3 minutes is 96 minus 61, which is 35 minutes. So this right over here is going to be 3:35. And so now our question is, how much time is there between 3:35 and 4:00 PM? Well, once again, 60 minutes in an hour. 4:00 PM is essentially the 60th minute. So if we take 60 minus 35, we get 2:25. So she has a total of 25 minutes remaining after the test before she has to get to volleyball practice. Just as a review. One minute between 1:59 and 2:00, then another 60."
Math,"That gets us to 61 total minutes. Then another 35 minutes gets us to 96 minutes have passed. And that also gets us to 3:35, which means we have 25 minutes until 4:00.."
Math,"The most common time we see a gallon is when you see a gallon of milk. So let's say that that whole thing is a gallon. You can imagine if it had a handle, it would be kind of a big gallon of milk. Now, there are 4 quarts per gallon. Let me write this over here. There are 4 quarts per gallon. So if I were to draw the quarts here, I could divide this gallon into 4 quarts, and then each of these sections would be a quart. So you would have 4 quarts."
Math,"So this right here that I've just drawn in blue would be exactly 1 quart. And obviously, there's 4 of them in this entire gallon. Now, you can divide the quarts into pints. You have 2 pints per quart. So this quart that I drew here, I can divide it into 2, like that, and this little section that I'm highlighting in magenta is a pint. That is a pint right over there. And then finally, there are 2 cups per pint. So this pint right here, I can divide it into 2, and each of these will be a cup."
Math,"So this section right here will be a cup. Now, we can go straight and figure out exactly how many cups there are per gallon. Actually, that might be an interesting way to think about it. If you have 4 quarts-- let's multiply it right here. So you have 4 quarts per gallon times 2 pints per quart. What does this give you? This gives you 4 times 2 is equal to 8. And then the quarts cancel out, and you have 8 pints per gallon."
Math,"And that makes complete sense because we had 4 quarts in this gallon, and then each of those quarts have 2 pints in them. So 4 times 2. So 8 pints per gallon. And then we can multiply that times 2 cups per pint. So I could just copy and paste this right here. Actually, I should've cut and paste. Let me select it again. I want to do that so I get that real estate back. So edit, cut, edit, paste. There you go. So now you multiply this times 2 cups per pint."
Math,"And the reason why this will work is because you have pints in the numerator. It cancels out with the pints in the denominator. And you will be left with-- I'll go back to the yellow-- 8 times 2 is 16. In the numerator, we have cups per gallon. Now, we just figured how many cups there are per gallon. That makes sense. This section right here is exactly 1/16 of this entire cube, this entire gallon. But we haven't even answered our question. We want to figure out how many cups there are in 3 and 1/2 gallons."
Math,"So let's write it over here. So we're concerned with 3 and 1/2 gallons. I don't like working with mixed numbers. I like to turn them into improper fractions. 3 and 1/2 is the same thing as 2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. This is the same thing as 7/2. If you divided 7 by 2, you would get 3 with a remainder of 1, or this would be 3 and 1/2, so this is the exact same thing. So we want to know how many cups are in 7/2 gallons. So what we want to do is end up with cups, and we want the gallons to cancel out."
Math,"So we have gallons in the numerator right here. It's definitely not in the denominator. And so we want to divide by gallons. And then we're going to have a numerator. We have cups in the numerator. And how many cups are there per gallon? Well, we just figured that out. There are 16 cups per gallon. When you multiply these two quantities, the gallons will cancel out, and you'll just be left with cups, and that's what we wanted. So it's going to be 7/2 times 16. So this is going to be 7 times 16/2 cups."
Math,"You could divide 16 by 2 to get 8. 2 divided by 2 is 1. So it just becomes 7 times 8 divided by 1, or just 7 times 8, which is 56. So this is equal to 56 cups. And this should make sense. This should be a much larger number because cups are a much smaller unit. So if you have 3 and 1/2 gallons, you will have many, many, many more cups in that 3 and 1/2 gallons, so this makes sense.."
Math,"But before I even do that, let's just think about how many inches there are in a yard. So if I have 1 yard, we know that there are 3 feet for every 1 yard, Right? And when you say, why am I multiplying by 3 instead of saying there's 1 yard for every 3 feet? And the easiest way to think about it is you're going to have a larger value over here, and you're also going to want to have these units right over here cancel out. So yard is canceling out with yard."
Math,"So you have 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, which is kind of what we already knew. I'm just showing you how the dimensions cancel out. And how many inches are there per foot? Well, we know that there are 12 inches for every 1 foot. And same logic over here, inches is a smaller unit of measurement so it makes sense that we're multiplying by 12. 3 feet is going to be more inches, so we're multiplying by 12. And also these units cancel out-- foot in the numerator, foot in the denominator."
Math,"3 times 12 divided by 1 is equal to 36 inches. So you might have already known it. But this is nice to have the dimensions cancel out like this. We know that 1 yard is equal to 36 inches. Or there are 36 inches for every 1 yard. And so we can now either break this down, or we can turn this into an improper fraction. First I'll just break it down into 4 yards plus 1/2 yards. So we could say that this is 4 yards."
Math,"So 4 yards is going to be equal to-- well, let's just multiply it times 36 inches, 36 inches for every 1 yard. The yards cancel out. 4 times 36 is 120, plus 24, so that's 144. So this is equal to 144 inches. That's just the 4 yards. And then if we do the 1/2 yards, so 1/2 of a-- I guess I say 1/2 yard, once again, times 36 inches per yard, the yards cancel out. 1/2 times 36 is going to be equal to 18 inches."
Math,"So 4 and 1/2 yards is the same thing as 4 yards plus 1/2 yards, which is the same thing as 144 inches plus 18 inches, which is going to give us-- let's just add it up over here on the right, 144 plus 18. 4 plus 8 is 12. 4 plus 1 is 5. You have this 1 up here, so it's 6, and then we have a 1. So when you add them all together, you get 162 inches. The other way to do this would have been to convert this into an improper fraction and then multiply by the unit. So let's do it that way."
Math,"If I have 4 and 1/2 of anything, really-- so let me write 4 and 1/2. I'm trying to find a suitable color. So if I have 4 and 1/2, this is the same thing-- 4 is the same thing as 8/2. This is the same thing-- so let me write it this way. 4 and 1/2 is the same thing as 4 plus 1/2, which is the same thing as-- if we want to have the same denominator as this 2 over here or as this 1/2 over here, this is the same thing as 8/2."
Math,"Or you could say 4/1 is the same thing as 8/2, if we want to have a common denominator, so 8/2 plus 1/2. Actually, let me write it that way, just so you really understand what we're doing. 4 is the same thing as 4/1. So it's 4/1 plus 1/2. If we want to find a common denominator, it's 2. So 4/1 is the same thing as 8/2 plus 1/2, which is equal to 9/2."
Math,"Now, I did it this way, which takes longer, just so you really understand how we converted it, why it makes-- hopefully conceptually why it just makes intuitive sense, why 4 and 1/2 is the same thing as 9/2. But if you want a simple process for it, you could just say, look, 4 times 2 is 8. 8 plus 1 is 9. And that gives you that 9 right over there, so 9/2. So we have 9/2 yards that we want to convert to inches. Same process-- times 36 inches per yard. Yard in the numerator, yard in the denominator."
Math,"We are left with 9/2 times 36. We could say times 36/1 if we like, 36 Inches for every 1 36-- or the number 36 really is the same as 36/1. And then we're left with just inches in our units. We're just left with inches. And over here there's several ways that we can simplify it. Probably the easiest way to simplify it is we can divide both our numerator and our denominator by 2. So let me write it this way. I don't want to skip steps. So we have 9 times 36 over 2 times 1, or over 2 inches."
Math,"And we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 2 to simplify it. They're both divisible by 2. 36 divided by 2 is 18. 2 divided by 2 is 1. So we're really just left with 9 times 18 inches. We can just multiply 9 times 18. Let me do it over here. 18 times 9. 8 times 9 is 72. 1 times 9 is 9, plus 7 is 16, so we get 162 inches. So all of this simplifies to 162 inches, and we are done.."
Math,"We have distance here in terms of miles, we have it here in terms of yards. So let's just get everything into yards. So he needs to run 2 miles. How do we convert that to yards? Well, I don't have it memorized how many yards there are per mile, but I do have it memorized how many feet there are per mile. And it's a good thing to have in the back of your brain someplace, that in general you have 5,280 feet per mile. It's a good number to know. 5,280 feet per mile."
Math,"So if we want to convert, we can first convert the miles to feet, and then we know that there are 3 feet per yard, and then we'll have 2 miles in terms of yards. So 2 miles, if we want it converted to feet, we want miles in the denominator and we want feet in the numerator. And the reason why I say that is so that this miles will cancel out with that miles, and we'll just have feet there. And I just wrote down, there's 5,280 feet per mile, or you say 5,280 feet for every 1 mile."
Math,"You can write it either way, but let's just write it like that. And then we can multiply. So this is going to give us what? If we just multiply the numbers 2 times 5,280. So what is that going to be? Maybe I should get a calculator out. Or we could do that in our head. Let's think of it this way: 2 times 80 is 160. 2 times 200 is 400. So it's going to be 400 plus 160 is going to be 560. And then 2 times 5,000 thousand is 10,000. So it's 10,560. And then the miles cancel out, and we are just left with feet."
Math,"And let me actually multiply it out. I did it in my head that time, but that's not always useful. Let me verify for you that 5,280 times 2 is indeed 10,560. So 2 times 0 is 0. 2 times 8 is 16. Carry the 1. 2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is 5. 2 times 5 is 10. 10,560. So he needs to run 10,560 feet. Now, we want this in terms of yards. So 10,560 feet. Let's convert this to yards. Well, we want it in yards."
Math,"So we want yards in the numerator, and we want feet in the denominator, so that the feet cancel out with that feet right there. And we know that there are 3 feet for every 1 yard. Or another way to read this is that you have 1/3 of a yard for every foot. And now we can multiply. And it makes sense. If you're going from feet to yards, the number should get smaller because yards is a bigger unit. You need fewer yards to go the same distance as a certain number of feet. So it makes sense that we're dividing."
Math,"Same thing: 2 miles is a ton of feet, so it made sense that we were multiplying by a large number. Here it makes sense that we're dividing. So let's do this. So this becomes 10,560 times 1 divided by 3. So it's 10,560/3. That's that and that part. And then the feet cancel out, and we are just left with yards. So 2 miles is 10,560 divided by 3. And let's figure out what that is. So 3 goes into 10,560. It doesn't go into 1. It goes into 10 three times. 3 times 3 is 9. And we subtract. We get 1."
Math,"Bring down this 5. It becomes a 15. 3 goes into 15 five times. 5 times 3 is 15. We have no remainder, or 0. You bring down the 6. 3 goes into 6 two times. Let me scroll down a little bit. 2 times 3 is 6. Subtract. No remainder. Bring down this last 0. 3 goes into 0 zero times. 0 times 3 is 0. And we have no remainder. So 2 miles is the equivalent to 3,520 yards. That's the total distance he has to travel. That's the equivalent of 2 miles. Now we want to figure out how many laps there are."
Math,"We want this in terms of laps, not in terms of yards. So we want the yards to cancel out. And we want laps in the numerator, right? Because when you multiply, the yards will cancel out, and we'll just be left with laps. Now, how many laps are there per yard or yards per lap? Well, they say the distance around the field is 300 yards. So we have 300 yards for every 1 lap. So now, multiply this right here. The yards will cancel out, and we will get 3,520. Let me do that in a different color."
Math,"We will get 3,520, that right there, times 1/300. When you multiply it times 1, it just becomes 3,520 divided by 300. And in terms of the units, the yards canceled out. We're just left with the laps. So this is how many laps he needs to run. So 3,520 divided by 300. Well, we can eyeball this right here. What is 11 times 300? Let's just approximate this right here. So if we did 11 times 300, what is that going to be equal to? Well, 11 times 3 is 33, and then we have two zeroes here. So this will be 3,300."
Math,"So it's a little bit smaller than that. If we have 12 times 300, what is that going to be? 12 times 3 is 36, and then we have these two zeroes, so it's equal to 3,600. So this is going to be 11 point something. It's larger than 11, right? 3,520 is larger than 3,300. So when you divide by 300 you're going to get something larger than 11. But this number right here is smaller than 3,600 so when you divide it by 300, you're going to get something a little bit smaller than 12."
Math,"So the exact number of laps is going to be a little bit lower than 12 laps. So 2 miles is a little bit lower than 12 laps. But let's make sure we're answering their question. How many complete laps would he need to do to run at least 2 miles? So they're telling us that, look, this might be, 11 point something, something, something laps. That would be the exact number of laps to run 2 miles. But they say how many complete laps does he have to run? 11 complete laps would not be enough."
Math,"He would have to run 12. So our answer here is 12 complete laps. That complete tells us that they want a whole number of laps. We can't just divide this. If we divide this, we're going to get some 11 point something, something. You can do with the calculator or do it by hand if you're interested. But we have to do at least 12 because that's the smallest whole number of laps that will get us to at least this distance right here, or this number of laps, or the equivalent of 2 miles.."
Math,"So they say it is 1 and 1/2 tons. And it's always easier to deal with improper fractions than mixed numbers, so let's write this as an improper fraction. 1 and 1/2 tons is the same thing as-- well, 1 ton is 2 halves, and then you add another 1 half, that's 3 halves. So you get 3/2 tons. Or another way to think about it is 2 times 1 is 2, plus 1 is 3. So the maximum capacity is 3/2 tons. Let's think about how many pounds that is. And to do that, we have to know that there are 2,000 pounds per ton."
Math,"Let me write this up here. We know that there are 2,000 pounds per ton. This wasn't given in the problem anywhere. This is something I knew from past experience, and it's a good thing to know, in general, that a ton is 2,000 pounds. So I'm going to write it right over here. Now, how do we convert these 3/2 tons into pounds? Well, we're going to multiply it by something, and the units that we're going to multiply by, we want the tons to cancel out."
Math,"So we're going to want to have tons in the denominator, so it cancels out with this tons up here. And then we want pounds in the numerator. And that's exactly what we wrote up here. There are 2,000 pounds for every 1 ton, or you could just say 2,000 pounds per ton. You could put the 1 there, but it doesn't really change the expression. Now, if we multiply 3/2 tons times 2,000 pounds per ton, what'll happen is that the tons cancel out. That was the whole point of multiplying it by this."
Math,"And we would be left with 3/2 times 2,000, and the only unit left is pounds. And if you do it this way, you'll never get confused. You'll know that the units cancel out so you're getting the right units. But if you just think about it in your mind, it should also make sense. If there are 2,000 pounds per ton and there are 1 and 1/2 tons, I should multiply 1 and 1/2 times 2,000 to get the number of pounds. That makes sense. And we know 1 and 1/2 times 2,000 is 3,000, but we'll figure it out right here."
Math,"So what is 3/2 times 2,000? Well, I just told you answer. We can actually simplify it right over here. This is going to be 3 times 2,000/2 pounds. We can divide the numerator and the denominator by 2. This will become 1,000, and this will become 1, so it's 3 times 1,000 pounds, or this is equal to 3,000 pounds. So what we've done so far, we've just figured out the maximum capacity of the elevator. It can hold 1 and 1/2 tons, which is the exact same thing as 3,000 pounds."
Math,"Now, what we need to figure out is 3,000 pounds is the equivalent to how many average adults of 160 pounds? Or how many 160 pound people would it take to weigh a total of 3,000 pounds? Well, we can just divide by 160. And if you want to make sure that the units work out, remember, we want our answer to be in terms of people, and we want the pounds to cancel out. So we have pounds in the numerator here, so if we divide by pounds, the pounds will cancel out."
Math,"And then we want our leftover to be people, or maybe person. Person, people, same thing. Let me do people. The grammar of it, singular, plural, might make it a little confusing, but I think you get the general idea. Now, if we were to write this out, what does it tell us? 1 person weighs 160 pounds, so there's one person for every 160 pounds. So notice, if we multiply these two expressions, the pounds will cancel out. We'll be just left with people."
Math,"We're multiplying 3,000 times 1/160, but it's really just taking 3,000 and dividing by 160, which makes sense. We have a capacity of 3,000. Each of our people weighs 160 pounds. Divide by 160. It tells you how many people. But this way, you know that the units are working out. So this is going to be equal to 3,000/160 people. That is the maximum capacity of the elevator in terms of average people. Now, what is this? Well, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 10."
Math,"If we divide the numerator and the denominator by 10, this becomes 300/16. If we divide 300 by 2, this becomes 150. If we divide 16 by 2, this becomes 8. Now, let's see, what can we do more here? We could divide by 2 again. Let me rewrite it. So this is the same thing as 150/8 people. 150, we can divide by 2. It gives us 75. And if you take 8 divided by 2, that is 4. So we have 75 divided by 4 people. Let me just do that, work it out. So you have 75 divided by 4. 4 goes into 7 one time. 1 times 4 is 4."
Math,"You subtract. 7 minus 4 is 3. Bring down this 5. 4 goes into 35 eight times. 8 times 4 is 32. Subtract. 5 minutes 2 is 3. And then you have the decimal. We're going to the right of the ones place. We're going to the tenths place now. So we can bring down a zero over here. 4 goes into 30 seven times. 7 times 4 is 28. You subtract. You get 2. Bring down another zero. 4 goes into 20 exactly five times. 5 times 4 is 20, and then we are done."
Math,"So this expression is exactly-- the 3,000 divided by 160, or the 150 divided by 8, the 75 divided by 4, it all turns out to be 18.75 people is the capacity of the elevator. 18.75 average 160-pound people would weigh 3,000 pounds. Now, do they want a decimal? What is the maximum number of adults who could safely ride the elevator? Well, if they're all going to be average, then the maximum number of adults, since you can't have 3/4 of a person, or 75/100 of a person, the maximum number is going to be 18."
Math,"If you have 19 average-weight adults, you are going to be too heavy, and the elevator will fall or something.."
Math,"We just need to figure out how many gallons that is, and then say, well, is that going to be more or less than 8 gallons? So we start with 80 pints. And we can take it step by step. You may or may not know how many pints there are per gallon, so let's just go straight to quarts first, and then from quarts we can go to gallons. But if you know right from the get go how many pints there are per gallon, you could go there. So let's convert this to quarts."
Math,"So we have 80 pints, so what are we going to multiply or divide by to get quarts? Well, one way to think about it, you're going from a smaller unit, pints, to a larger unit, so you're going to have less of that larger unit. So you're going to divide. This number's going to be smaller when it goes into quarts. And it's going to be smaller by a factor of 2 because you have 2 pints per quart. You're not going to multiply by 2. You're not going to have more quarts. You're going to divide by 2."
Math,"So you could say, times 1/2. This is the same thing as dividing by 2, and we'll make sure that the units work out. We have one quart for every 2 pints, or you can view this as 2 pints per quart or 1/2 of a quart per pint. Either way, the units work out, and you're essentially taking 80 and dividing by 2, or multiplying by 1/2, and you get 40 quarts. And I want to make sure that your brain does it both ways."
Math,"Because when you're just doing it, you don't have paper, you don't have the units around, you should just think, hey, 80 pints, there's 2 pints per quart. I'm going to have half as many quarts. I'm going to have 40 quarts. But when problems get a little bit more complicated, it is nice to make sure that the units cancel out in this way, so that you know, OK, 1 quart is 2 pints. Pints in the denominator, pints in the numerator, cancel them out, and I'm just left with quarts, and 80 times 1/2, which is 40."
Math,"So we have 40 quarts now, and now we can convert this to gallons. We know that there are 4 quarts per gallon or that 1 gallon has 4 quarts. And once again, we're going to go from a smaller unit to a larger unit, to gallons. So we know there's a factor of 4 difference. Since you're going to a larger unit, your brain should say, hey, I'm going to divide by 4. I'm going to have a factor 4 fewer gallons because it's a larger unit."
Math,"And to make sure that units work out, you just remember, well, we have quarts up here in the numerator, you're going to want quarts down here in the denominator. And we care about converting into gallons, and 1 gallon is 4 quarts. And this will work out. The quarts will cancel out. And notice, you're also dividing by 4. 40 times 1/4 is the exact same thing as 40 divided by 4, which makes sense. We're going to a larger unit. So 40 times 1/4 is 10, and the units left are gallons."
Math,"So the 80 pints of blood that the hospital collected is 10 gallons. Their goal was only 8 gallons. So did they meet their goal? Yes, they met their goal! How much more or less than their goal did the hospital collect? Well, their goal was 8, they collected 10. They collected 2 extra gallons than their goal.."
Math,"Day one we slept seven and 1/4 hours, day two seven and 3/4, day three seven and 3/4, day four eight 1/2 hours. Then it says, create a line plot that shows all of the measurements on the number line below. And it says click above the tick marks to add dots, click on tick marks to remove dots. So we can see if I click right over here, a tick mark shows up. And if I click again, it gets removed. So let's see, day one you slept seven and 1/4 hours. So, that's one day where you sleep seven and 1/4."
Math,"So, seven and 1/4 is right between seven and seven and 1/2. So that's right over there. There we go. On day two you sleep seven and 3/4 hours. So, that's 1/4, 2/4, 3/4. So that's day two. Day three you also sleep seven and 3/4 hours, so that's another day that you sleep seven and 3/4 hours. And then on day four you sleep eight and 1/2 hours, which is right over there. And so, here we go. We have created a line plot that shows all of the measurements. On one day, day one it was, I slept seven and 1/4 hours."
Math,"There were two days where I slept seven and 3/4 hours, and there was one day where I slept eight and 1/2 hours. Let's do another example. Amy ran many miles during September. She recorded how long it took her to run each mile, rounded to the nearest 1/4 of a minute on the table below. We can see it right over here, actually let me move my window a little bit so you can see everything. And then it says, create a line plot that shows all of the measurements on the number line below."
Math,"All right, so three times she was able to run a mile in eight and 3/4 minutes. So, there are three that were eight and 3/4. Notice, this is, if we look at the space between eight and nine, there is one, two, three, four equal intervals. And so, 3/4 is going to be three of those. One, two, three. She ran a mile in eight and 3/4 minutes three times. That's what we saw from that table. So, that's three times she did that. She ran a mile in nine and 1/4 minutes two times. So nine and 1/4."
Math,"That is 1/4 of the way to 10, we can see 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4. So nine and 1/4 she did two times. So that's going to be one, two. And then let's see, nine and 1/2 she did four times. Nine and 1/2 is here, so one, two, three, four. And then eight and 1/2 she did one time. So that's eight and 1/2 right over there. And then she ran a mile in nine minutes five times. Nine minutes right over here. One, two, three, four, five. And we're done.."
Math,"All right, then they ask us, what is the difference, in weight, between the two heaviest babies? So pause this video and try to figure that out before we work through it together. All right, now where are the two heaviest babies? So this one out here, this is the heaviest baby, and what is its weight? Well, let's see. Its weight is right over there, and what is that number or what is that weight? So this is nine and this is 10, and we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight equal spaces."
Math,"So each of these is an eighth. So this is nine and one, two, nine and 2/8. So this one is, let me write this. This is nine and 2/8. Another way to think about it is, 2/8 is the same thing as 1/4, 'cause if you think about it, it's one, two, three, four equal spaces. This is also nine and 1/4 of the way to 10, so this is the same thing as nine and 1/4. And then what's the second heaviest babies? 'Cause we want the weight difference between the two heaviest."
Math,So the second heaviest baby is right over here and we know that it is eight and a half pounds. So what we really need to do is figure out what is the difference between nine and 2/8 or nine and 1/4 and eight and a half right over here? So we could set this up as a subtraction.
Math,"This is going to be nine and, let's call it nine and 1/4, minus, minus eight and a half, and we can actually use this, this, these measurement scales or you can even view this as something of a number line to help us think about this. The difference is this length right over here. And we could think about it in terms of eighths, 'cause each of these hash marks is an eighth, so 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8 and 6/8. So this is equal to 6/8."
Math,"We could also think about it in terms of fourths, so this is 1/4, 2/4, and 3/4. So this is equal to 3/4. So what's the difference in weight between the two heaviest babies? It is 3/4 of a pound.."
Math,"If the total amount of trail mix in all of the bags were redistributed so that each bag contained an equal amount of trail mix, how much trail mix would be in each bag? All measurements are rounded to the nearest eighth of an ounce. So right now the bags, there's different amounts depending on which bag you look at. But they want us to redistribute it."
Math,"So what we really wanna do is think about let's take all of the trail mix in the four bags together, and then divide it by four so that they all have an even amount. So let's just think about how much trail mix we have in these four bags together. So we have this bag right over here, and it has this amount. And let's see, it says rounded to the nearest eighth of an ounce. Are these eighths? Let's see, this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
Math,"Yep, so between two and three is divided into eight sections. So each of these hash marks are an eighth. So this is 2 1/8, 2 2/8. So this is 2 2/8. Now 2/8 is the same thing as 1/4. You can divide two by two and eight by two, and you would get 1/4. So 2 2/8 is the same thing as 2 1/4. Now you have this bag right over here, and how much is in this bag? Well let's see, that is 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8. So that's going to be 2 6/8."
Math,"Now 6/8, six and eight are both divisible by two, so if you divide them both by two, that's the same thing as 3/4. So that's the same thing as 2 3/4. 2 3/4. And now you have two dots right over at this point over here. So there's two dots that have this many ounces of trail mix. Well how many ounces is this? 3 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8. So that's 3 4/8. Well 4/8 is the same thing, they're both divisible by four. Four divided by four is one, eight divided by four is two. This is the same thing as 3 1/2. 3 1/2."
Math,"And you see that this dot right over here, it is halfway between three and four. And so let's think about, let's list the amount of ounces in each of the bags. So you have 2 1/4 ounces. That's one of the bags. You have another bag that's 2 3/4 ounces. Then you have two bags, remember there's two bags here, that's what the dot plot does for us. We have two bags here that are 3 1/2 ounces. So 3 1/2 and 3 1/2. Now let me make sure that doesn't look like an exponent to you. 3 1/2."
Math,"Now what was our strategy? What we wanted to do is redistribute all of the trail mix so that we have the same amount in each bag. So one way that you could imagine this is imagine everyone pouring their trail mix into a big pile and then dividing that pile into four, and then putting exactly 1/4 of the total into each bag. Then you would redistribute it so that you have the same amount in each bag. So let's add it all together. Let's create our pile. Let's add 2 1/4 plus 2 3/4 plus 3 1/2 plus 3 1/2."
Math,"Well what is, let's see, two plus two is four. 1/4 plus 3/4 is going to be 4/4. So this right over here is going to equal to five. Another way to think about it, you could rewrite these. You could say 2 1/4, two is the same thing as 8/4, so this would be 9/4 plus, let's see, four times two is eight plus three is 11. Plus 11/4. Then you would have 3 1/2 plus 3 1/2, you might be able to say three plus three is six, 1/2 plus 1/2 is one, so it's going to be seven."
Math,"But if you wanted to write it like this, you could write 3 1/2, that's two times three is six, plus one is seven. Plus 7/2 plus 7/2. So these are sometimes called improper fractions, although some people disagree with calling them improper fractions. These are just fractions where the numerator is greater than the denominator. But anyway, let's add all of this up. So 9/11, let me see what color I haven't used yet."
Math,"Sorry, not 9/11, 9/4 plus 11/4 is going to be equal to what? This part is going to be equal to 20/4, which is the same thing as five. 20 divided by four is five, or you could say 20/4 is going to be five wholes. Then 7/2 plus 7/2, that's going to be 14/2, plus 14/2, that's this part right over here. 14/2 is the same thing as seven. Five plus seven. So in total, you have 12 ounces."
Math,"Once again, I just did this as another way to do it, but you could have just said, look, two plus two is four, 1/4 plus 3/4 is another whole. So four plus one is five. Then 3 1/2 plus 3 1/2, three plus three is six, 1/2 plus 1/2 is one, six plus one is seven. So in total, you have 12 ounces. Now that's if you combine everything together, but now we wanna redistribute it into the four bags. We wanna divide it equally into four bags."
Math,"So you just take your 12 ounces, let me do this in a new color, you just wanna take your 12 ounces and divide it by four. Divide it into four equal groups. Then you're gonna get three ounces per bag. So that's our answer. How much trail mix would be in each bag? Three ounces. And we are done.."
Math,"And we're going to be talking about two-dimensional shapes that have four sides and four vertices and four angles. So, for example-- one, two, three, four. That is a quadrilateral, although that last side didn't look too straight. One, two, three, four. That is a quadrilateral. One, two, three, four. These are all quadrilaterals. They all have four sides, four vertices, and, clearly, four angles. One angle, two angles, three angles, and four angles."
Math,"Actually, let me draw this one a little bit bigger, because it's interesting. So in this one right over here, you have one angle, two angles, three angles, and then you have this really big angle right over there. If you look at the interior angles of this quadrilateral. Now, quadrilaterals, as you can imagine, can be subdivided into other groups based on the properties of the quadrilaterals. And the main subdivision of quadrilaterals is between concave and convex quadrilaterals."
Math,"So you have concave, and you have convex. And the way I remember concave quadrilaterals, or really concave polygons of any number of shapes, is that it looks like something has caved in. So, for example, this is a concave quadrilateral. It looks like this side has been caved in. And one way to define concave quadrilaterals-- so let me draw it a little bit bigger, so this right over here is a concave quadrilateral-- is that it has an interior angle that is larger than 180 degrees."
Math,"So for example, this interior angle right over here is larger than 180 degrees. And it's an interesting proof. Maybe I'll do a video. It's actually a pretty simple proof to show that, if you have a concave quadrilateral, if at least one of the interior angles has a measure larger than 180 degrees, that none of the sides can be parallel to each other. The other type of quadrilateral, you can imagine, is when all of the interior angles are less than 180 degrees."
Math,"And you might say, wait-- what happens at 180 degrees? Well, if this angle was 180 degrees, then these wouldn't be two different sides, it would just be one side. And that would look like a triangle. But if all of the interior angles are less than 180 degrees, then you're dealing with a convex quadrilateral. So this convex quadrilateral would involve that one and that one over there. So this right over here is what a convex quadrilateral could look like-- four points, four sides, four angles."
Math,"Now, within convex quadrilaterals, there are some other interesting categorizations. So now we're just going to focus on convex quadrilaterals, so that's going to be all of this space over here. So one type of convex quadrilateral is a trapezoid. And a trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral, and sometimes the definition here is a little bit-- different people will use different definitions. So some people will say a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that has exactly two sides that are parallel to each other."
Math,"So, for example, they would say that this right over here is a trapezoid, where this side is parallel to that side. If I give it some letters here, if I call this trapezoid ABCD, we could say that segment AB is parallel to segment DC, and because of that we know that this is a trapezoid. Now I said that the definition is a little fuzzy, because some people say you can have exactly one pair of parallel sides, but some people say at least one pair of parallel sides."
Math,"So if you use the original definition-- and that's the kind of thing that most people are referring to when they say a trapezoid, exactly one pair of parallel sides-- It might be something like this. But if you use the broader definition of at least one pair of parallel sides, then maybe this could also be considered a trapezoid so you have one pair of parallel sides like that and then you have another pair of parallel sides like that. So this is a question mark where it comes to a trapezoid."
Math,"A trapezoid is definitely this thing here, where you have exactly one pair of parallel sides. Depending on people's definition, this may or may not be a trapezoid. If you say it's exactly one pair of parallel sides, this is not a trapezoid, because it has two pairs. If you say at least one pair of parallel sides, then this is a trapezoid. So I'll put that in a little question mark there. But there is a name for this, regardless of your definition of what a trapezoid is."
Math,"If you have a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides, you are then dealing with a parallelogram. So the one thing that you definitely can call this is a parallelogram. And I'll just draw it a little bit bigger. So it's a quadrilateral, and if I have a quadrilateral, and if I have two pairs of parallel sides. So the opposite sides are parallel. So that side is parallel to that side, and then this side is parallel to that side there-- you're dealing with a parallelogram."
Math,"And then parallelograms can be subdivided even further. If the four angles in a parallelogram are all right angles, you're dealing with a rectangle. So let me draw one like that. This is all in the parallelogram universe, what I'm drawing right over here. This is all the parallelogram universe. So it's a parallelogram, which tells me that opposite sides are parallel. And then if we know that all four angles are 90 degrees."
Math,And we've proven in previous videos how to figure out the sum of the interior angles of any polygon. And using that same method you could say that the sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is actually 360 degrees. And you see that in this special case as well. But maybe we'll prove it in a separate video. But this right over here we would call a rectangle. Parallelogram-- opposite sides parallel and we have four right angles.
Math,"Now, if we have a parallelogram where we don't necessarily have four right angles, but where we do have the length of the sides being equal, then we're dealing with a rhombus. So let me draw it like that. So it's a parallelogram. This is a parallelogram, so that side is parallel to that side, this side is parallel to that side. And we also know that all four sides have equal length."
Math,"So this side's length is equal to that side's length, which is equal to that side's length, which is equal to that side's length. Then we are dealing with a rhombus. So one way to view it-- all rhombi are parallelograms. All rectangles are parallelograms. All parallelograms you cannot assume to be rectangles. All parallelograms you cannot assume to be rhombi. Now, something can be both a rectangle and a rhombus. So let's say that this is the universe of rectangles."
Math,"So the universe of rectangles-- I'll draw a little bit of a Venn diagram here-- is that set of shapes and the universe of rhombi is this set of shapes right over here. So what would it look like? Well, you would have four right angles and they would all have the same length. So it would look like this. So it'd definitely be a parallelogram. Four right angles and all the sides would have the same length. And this is probably the first of the shapes that you learned, or one of the first shapes."
Math,"This is clearly a square. So all squares could also be considered a rhombus, and they could also be considered a rectangle, and they could also be considered a parallelogram. But clearly, not all rectangles are squares, and not all rhombi are squares. And definitely not all parallelograms are squares. This one, clearly, right over here, is neither a rectangle nor a rhombi, nor a square. So that's an overview. Just gives you a little bit of taxonomy of quadrilaterals."
Math,"And then in the next few videos, we can start to explore them and find their interesting properties or just do interesting problems involving them.."
Math,"So it is definitely a quadrilateral. Next, we have to think about whether it is a parallelogram. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral that has two pairs of parallel sides, where in each pair they're opposite sides. And in this case, if you look at this side over here, it forms a 90-degree angle with this line. And this side over here also forms a 90-degree angle with this line over here. So these two sides are parallel. And then you could make the exact same argument for the other two sides."
Math,"This line up here forms a 90-degree angle with this side. And so does this side. It forms a 90-degree angle with this line right over here. They form the same angle with this line. They're parallel. So this side is parallel to that side right over there. So this is definitely also a parallelogram. Next, we ask about a trapezoid. Now, trapezoid is interesting. Sometimes a trapezoid is defined as any quadrilateral having at least one pair of parallel sides."
Math,"Sometimes it's defined as having only one pair of parallel sides. So let me write this down. Trapezoid, there's a debate here. It's not completely settled. Some people say at least one pair of parallel sides. That's one definition, one possible definition. The other one is at exactly one pair of parallel sides. How we answer this question depends on which definition for trapezoid we pick. Now, the one that people most refer to is actually this one right over here, exactly one pair of parallel sides."
Math,"So when you think of a trapezoid, they think of something like this, where this side over here is parallel to that side over here and those two are not parallel. But sometimes you'll also see this at least one pair of parallel sides. And so this would include parallelograms. It would be inclusive of parallelograms because parallelograms have two pairs of parallel sides. But I'm going to go with this definition right over here, exactly one pair of parallel sides."
Math,"This has two pairs of parallel sides so I will not call it a trapezoid. But it's always important to clarify what people are talking about because some people might say a trapezoid is at least one pair of parallel sides. And if we used that definition, then we would call it a trapezoid. So it really depends on the definition that you're using. Now, let's go on to rhombus. So a rhombus is a quadrilateral where four of the sides are congruent. So a rhombus will look like this."
Math,"All four sides have the same length. They're not necessarily at right angles to each other. This figure over here, we have two pairs of a size that are the same length, but there's no information that tells us that this side is equal to that side or that this side is equal to that side. So we can't make the claim that this is necessarily a rhombus. We don't know for sure. If someone told us that this length is equal to that length, then things change."
Math,"But for the sake of this one, we're not going to go with a rhombus. A rectangle is essentially a parallelogram that has four right angles. And we already established this is a parallelogram, and it also has four right angles-- one, two, three, four. So this is a rectangle. Another way to think about a rectangle is opposite sides have the same length, and you have four right angles. So this is definitely a rectangle. A square, a couple of way you can think about a square."
Math,"You could view a square as a rhombus with four right angles So if were to straighten it out a little bit, it's a rhombus so all the four sides are the same. And you have four right angles. That's one way to think about a square. Or you could view it as a rectangle where all four sides are congruent. But in either case, you have to have all four sides be congruent in order to be a square. And we already established we ruled out this being a rhombus, that all four sides here are not necessarily congruent."
Math,"You have two pairs of congruent sides, but we don't know whether this side and this side are congruent. So we cannot call this a square. So it's not a square, not a rhombus, not a trapezoid by the definition we picked, which is the less inclusive version where you say exactly one pair of parallel sides. It is a quadrilateral. It is a parallelogram. It is a rectangle.."
Math,"Let's also make this a mathematical term. This is a shape like a parallelogram or like a rhombus. It's just another type of quadrilateral. But in order for it to be used in mathematics in a useful way, we have to define it a little bit more precisely. So let's see if we can come up with a couple of interesting definitions of what a kite could be or a couple of interesting ways to construct a kite."
Math,"Well, one way that you could think about a kite is it looks like it has two pairs of sides that are congruent to each other. So, for example, it looks like this side and this side need to be congruent to each other. So let's make that a constraint. And they touch each other. They have a shared common endpoint. So you have one pair of congruent sides that's adjacent to each other. They have a common endpoint. And then you have another pair of sides that are congruent to each other. And they are adjacent."
Math,"They share a common endpoint. So one definition that you could make for a kite is that you have two pairs of congruent sides, where the congruent sides are adjacent. And you might say, well, what's the other alternative? If the congruent sides aren't adjacent, what else could they be? Well, the congruent sides could be opposite each other. And what happens if you were to do that? So if these two sides are congruent, but they didn't have a common endpoint, we're still dealing with a quadrilateral."
Math,"What would it look like? Well, you would have one congruent site here, and that would be congruent to this side right over here. And then you would have a congruent side right over here that is congruent to this side. This would be a situation where you have two pairs of congruent sides, but they're not adjacent. They don't have any common endpoints with each other. Each side in the congruent side pair, they're opposite to each other. So here, once again, we get a quadrilateral. We still get four sides."
Math,"A kite is a quadrilateral. This is a quadrilateral. But this isn't a kite. This right over here is a parallelogram, and we've seen that multiple times before. But kites can also be constructed in other interesting ways. You might see that what looks right here, that these two diagonals of this kite are perpendicular. And that indeed-- and I'm not going to prove it here-- is a property of a kite. These two lines, these two diagonals, intersect at a 90-degree angle."
Math,"The other thing we know about kites is that one of these lines is bisecting the other of the two. So you could actually construct a kite that way. You could start with a line, and then you could construct a perpendicular bisector of that line, another segment that bisects it at a 90-degree angle. So here, there you go. So that bisects it, so that means that this segment is equal to this segment. We split it in two. And then if you connect the endpoints of the segments, you should get a kite."
Math,"And you will indeed get a kite. So it would look something like this. And once again, this segment is congruent to this adjacent segment, and this segment is congruent to this adjacent segment. But what would happen if these two diagonals are both perpendicular bisectors of each other? So what would happen in this scenario, where-- let me draw one segment. And then I'm going to make another segment, but they're going to be perpendicular bisectors of each other. So let's do that."
Math,"So now they're both perpendicular bisectors of each other. So this segment is equal to this segment, and this segment is equal to this segment. Well, now, once again, you still have a kite, but now you're also satisfying the constraint for another type of quadrilateral that we've seen. So now you're satisfying the constraint. All your sides are equal. All of your sides are parallel. You're now dealing with a rhombus, which is also a special type of parallelogram."
Math,"And then if you were to go even further, where these two diagonals have the exact same length and they're both perpendicular bisectors of each other, so you have both the exact same length. I'll try to draw it as cleanly as I can. So they're both the exact same length, and they're both perpendicular bisectors of each other. So each of these halves would be the same length as well. Then you have a subset of-- I guess I could say-- rhombi, and you get to a square."
Math,"So one way of thinking about it is any square is also a rhombus. And any rhombus is also going to satisfy your constraints for being a kite. But there's a bunch of types that don't satisfy your constraints of being a rhombus or a square. A kite is just two pairs of congruent sides that are adjacent to each other, and they're usually pretty easy to spot out because they look like kites.."
Math,"And we see that we have two pairs of parallel sides. Or we could also say there are two pairs of congruent sides here as well. This side is parallel and congruent to this side. This side is parallel and congruent to that side. So we're dealing with a parallelogram. Let's do more of these. So here it looks like a same type of scenario we just saw in the last one. We have two pairs of parallel and congruent sides, but all the sides aren't equal to each other."
Math,"If they're all equal to each other, we'd be dealing with a rhombus. But here, they're not all equal to each other. This side is congruent to the side opposite. This side is congruent to the side opposite. That's another parallelogram. Now this is interesting. We have two pairs of sides that are parallel to each other, but now all the sides have an equal length. So this would be a parallelogram. And it is a parallelogram, but they're saying to be as specific as possible with the given data."
Math,"So saying it's a rhombus would be more specific than saying it's a parallelogram. This does satisfy the constraints for being a parallelogram, but saying it's a rhombus tells us even more. Not every parallelogram is a rhombus, but every rhombus is a parallelogram. Here, they have the sides are parallel to the side opposite and all of the sides are equal. Let's do a few more of these. What is the type of this quadrilateral? Be as specific as possible with the given data ."
Math,"So we have two pairs of sides that are parallel, or I should say one pair. We have a pair of sides that are parallel. And then we have another pair of sides that are not. So this is a trapezoid. But then they have two choices here. They have trapezoid and isosceles trapezoid. Now an isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid where the two non-parallel sides have the same length, just like an isosceles triangle, you have two sides have the same length."
Math,"Well we could see these two non-parallel sides do not have the same length. So this is not an isosceles trapezoid. If they did have the same length, then we would pick that because that would be more specific than just trapezoid. But this case right over here, this is just a trapezoid. Let's do one more of these. What is the type of this quadrilateral? Well we could say it's a parallelogram because all of the sides are parallel."
Math,"But if we wanted to be more specific, you could also see that all the sides are the same. So you could say it's a rhombus, but you could get even more specific than that. You notice that all the sides are intersecting at right angles. So this is-- if we wanted to be as specific as possible-- this is a square. Let me check the answer. Got it right.."
Math,"And a parallelogram is definitely a quadrilateral. A quadrilateral is a four-sided figure, and it is definitely a four-sided figure. A parallelogram is not always a rhombus. A rhombus is a special case of a parallelogram where not only do you have to sets of parallel lines as your sides, two sets of parallel sides, but all of the sides are the same length in a rhombus. And a square is a special case of a rhombus where all of the angles are 90 degrees."
Math,"So here, all we can say is that a parallelogram is a quadrilateral. And so let's check our answer. And it's always a good idea to look at hints. And so it'll kind of say the same thing that we just said, but it would say it for the particular problem that you're actually looking at. Let's do a few more of these. Suzanne is on an expedition to save the universe. Sounds like a reasonable expedition to go on. For her final challenge, she has to play a game called Find the Rhombuses."
Math,"A wizard tells her that she has a square, a quadrilateral, and a parallelogram, and she must identify which of the shapes are also rhombuses. Which of these shapes should she pick to save the universe? So a square is a special case of a rhombus. Just to remind ourselves, a rhombus, the opposite sides are parallel to each other. You have two sets of parallel sides. A square has two sets of parallel sides, and it has the extra condition that all of the angles are right angles."
Math,"So a square is definitely going to be a rhombus. Now, all rhombuses have four sides. So all rhombuses are quadrilaterals. But not all quadrilaterals are rhombuses. You could have a quadrilateral where none of the sides are parallel to each other. So we won't click this one. Once again, a parallelogram. So all rhombuses are parallelograms. They have two sets of parallel sides, two sets of parallel line segments representing their sides. But all parallelograms are not rhombuses."
Math,"So I would say that if someone gives you square, you can say, look, a square is always going to be a rhombus. A quadrilateral isn't always going to be a rhombus, nor is a parallelogram always going to be a rhombus. We got it right.."
Math,"Of apples, to oranges? To oranges. To clarify what we're even talking about, a ratio is giving us the relationship between quantities of 2 different things. So there's a couple of ways that we can specify this. We can literally count the number of apples. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So we have 6 apples. And we can say the ratio is going to be 6 to, 6 to ... And then how many oranges do we have? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It is 6 to 9. The ratio of apples to oranges is 6 to 9. And you could use a different notation."
Math,"You could also write it this way. 6 to ... You would still read the ratio as being 6 to 9. But we don't have to just satisfy us with this because one way to think about ratios, especially if we're thinking about apples to oranges, is how many apples do we have for a certain number of oranges? When you think about it that way, we can actually reduce these numbers, as you might have already thought about. Both 6 and 9 are divisible by 3. So just like we can reduce fractions, we can also reduce ratios."
Math,"So if you divide 6 and 9 both by 3. 6 divided by 3 is 2. 6 divided by 3 is 2. And 9 divided by 3 is 3. So we could also say that the ratio of apples to oranges is 2 to 3. Or if we want to use this notation, 2 to 3. 2 to 3. Now, does that make sense? Well look. We divided each of these groups into 3. So one way to think about it ... If you divide this whole total into 3 groups. So 1 group, 1 group. 2 groups, 2 groups. And 3 equal groups."
Math,"We see that in each of those groups, for every 2 apples, for every 2 apples, we have 3 oranges. For 2 apples we have 3 oranges. For 2 apples we have 3 oranges. So, once again, the ratio of apples to oranges. For every 2 apples we have 3 oranges. But we could think about things the other way around as well. We could also think about what is the ratio ... We could also think about what is the ratio ... Ratio, of oranges to apples? Oranges to apples. And here we would, essentially, switch the numbers."
Math,"The ratio of oranges to apples. Notice, up here we said apples to oranges which is 6 to 9 or 2 to 3 if we reduce them. And here we're going to say the ratio of oranges to apples, so we've swapped these 2. So we're going to swap the numbers. Here we have 9 oranges for every 6 apples. So we could say the ratio is going to be 9 to 6. The ratio is 9 to 6. Or if we want to reduce it, for every 3 oranges ... So we're going to divide this by 3. So for every 3 oranges we are going to have 2 apples."
Math,"We are going to have 2 apples. So notice, this is just exactly what we had up here, but when we had apples to oranges it was 6 to 9. 6 apples for every 9 oranges. And now when it's oranges to apples, we say it's 9 to 6. 9 oranges for every 6 apples. Or we could say for every 3 oranges we have exactly 2 apples.."
Math,"""What is the ratio of people waiting in line ""for the round-up ""to the people waiting in line for the slingshot?"" Pause this video and see if you can figure it out. So we wanna know the ratio of the people waiting in line for the round-up, this is the round-up right over here, to the number of people waiting in line for the slingshot. So, there's 11 people waiting in line for the round-up, and there are four people waiting in line for the slingshot, so the ratio is 11 to four."
Math,"Or for every 11 people in line for the round-up, there are four people waiting in line for the slingshot. Let's do another example. ""Katie loves to read! ""In the last few months, she has read three graphic novels, ""two mysteries, four science fiction novels, ""and 21 comic books. ""What is the ratio of sci-fi novels to comic books?"" So once again, pause this video and try to work it out on your own."
Math,"All right, so we wanted to know the ratio of sci-fi novels, so she has four sci-fi novels, the ratio of that to comic books. She has 21 comic books. So the ratio is for every four sci-fi novels, she has 21 comic books. Do you want me to do that in that other color? She has 21 comic books. So the ratio is four to 21, the ratio of sci-fi novels to comic books. Four sci-fi novels for every 21 comic books. Let's do one more example. This is strangely fun."
Math,"""What is the ratio of apples to bananas?"" Pause this video and try to figure it out. So let's see, there are one, two, three apples. So for every three apples, how many bananas are there? Well, there's one, two, three, four bananas. So the ratio of apples to, the ratio of apples to bananas is three apples for every four bananas. Order matters. If they said the ratio of bananas to apples, then this would be four to three, but they say apples to bananas, three to four. Three apples for every four bananas.."
Math,"Instead of taking the ratio of the number of apples to the number of oranges, let's take the number of apples to the number of fruit. The number of fruit that we have over here. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about that on your own. Well, how many total apples do we have? We have 2, 4, 6, 8 apples. So we're going to have 8 apples. And then how much total fruit do we have? Well we have 8 apples and we have 3, 6, 9, 12 oranges. So our total fruit is 8 plus 12. We have 20 pieces of fruit."
Math,"So this ratio is going to be 8 to ... 8 to 20. Or, if we want to write this in a more reduced form, we can divide both of these by 4. 4 is their greatest common divisor. And so this is the same thing as a ratio. 8 divided by 4 is 2 and 20 divided by 4 is 5. So 2 to 5. Now, does this make sense? Well, if we divide ... If we divide everything into groups of 4. So ... Or if we divide into 4 groups, I should say. So 1 group, 2 groups, 3 groups, and 4 groups."
Math,"That's the largest number of groups that we can divide these into so that we don't have to cut up the apples or the oranges. We see that in each group, for every 2 apples we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pieces of fruit. For every 2 apples we have 5 pieces of fruit. This is actually a good opportunity for us to introduce another way of representing ... Another way of representing ratios, and that's using fraction notation. So we could also represent this ratio as 2 over 5. As the fraction 2 over 5."
Math,"Whenever we put it in the fraction it's very important to recognize what this represents. This is telling us the fraction of fruit that are apples. So we could say 2/5 of the fruit ... Of the fruit ... Of the number of fruit, I guess I could say. Of number of fruit ... Of fruit is equal to the number of apples. Right, I'm just going to say 2/5 of fruit if we're just speaking in more typical terms. 2/5 of fruit are apples. Are, are apples."
Math,"So, once again, this is introducing another way of representing ratios. We could say that the ratio of apples to fruit, once again, it could be 2 to 5 like that. It could be 2, instead of putting this little colon there we could literally write out the word to. 2 to 5. Or we could say it's 2/5, the fraction 2/5, which would sometimes be read as 2 to 5. This is also, when it's written this way, you could also read that as a ratio, depending on the context."
Math,In a sentence like this I would read this as 2/5 of the fruit are apples..
Math,"All right, this is the table they're talking about. Based on the ratio, complete the missing values in the table. So why don't you pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Well, first, let's think about the ratio of blue to green squares. So for every three blue squares or that seem a similar color, for every three blue squares, we are going to have one, two, three, four, five green squares. So the ratio of blue to green is three to five, and so in quilt A, she has 21 blue squares."
Math,"So she has 21 blue squares. How many green squares would she have? Well, to go from three to 21, you have to multiply by seven, and so you would take five and then multiply that by seven. So you'd multiply five times seven to get to 35. As long as you multiply both of these by the same number or divide them by the same number, you're going to get an equivalent ratio. So 21 to 35 is the same thing as three to five. Now we have a situation in quilt B."
Math,"They've given us the number of green squares, so that's 20. Well, how do we get 20 from five? Well, we would multiply by four. So if you multiply the number of green squares by four, then you would do the same thing for the number of blue squares. Three times four... Three times four is going to be equal to 12. 12 blue squares for every 20 green squares is the same ratio as three blue squares for every five green squares. Let's do another example."
Math,"Here, we are told the following diagram describes the number of cups of blue and red paint in a mixture. What is the ratio of blue paint to red paint in the mixture? So try to work it out. All right, so let's just see. We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10... 10 cups of blue paint for every one, two, three, four, five, six cups of red paint."
Math,"So this would be a legitimate ratio, a ratio of 10 cups of blue paint for every six cups of red paint, but this isn't in I guess you could say lowest terms or most simplified terms because we can actually divide both of these numbers by two, so if you divide 10 by two, you get five. I'll do that in blue color, and if you divide six by two, you get three."
Math,"So one way to think about it is for every five blue squares, you have three red squares in this diagram, in this tape diagram that's sometimes called, or you could say for every five cups of blue paint, you have three cups of red paint in our mixture, and you could even see that here. So three cups of red paint and one, two, three, four, five... And five cups of blue paint, and you see that again right over here. Let's do another example. Here, we're told Luna and Ginny each cast magic spells."
Math,"The ratio of spells Luna casts to spells Ginny casts is represented in this tape diagram. All right, based on the ratio, what is the number of spells Ginny casts when Luna casts 20 spells? Pause this video to see if you can work it out. All right, so let's just see the ratio here. For every one, two, three, four spells that Luna casts, Ginny casts one, two, three, four, five spells. So the ratio is four to five, but if Luna casts 20 spells..."
Math,"So if a Luna casts 20 spells, well to go from four to 20, we had to multiply by five, and so we would do the same thing with the number of spells Ginny casts. You'd multiply that by five, so it's 25. So four Luna spells for every five Ginny spells is the same thing as 20 Luna spells for every 25 Ginny spells, and so how many spells does Ginny cast when Luna casts 20 spells? She casts 25, and we're done.."
Math,"And let's be clear, this is showing the ratio of open-ended questions to multiple choice questions. It's not telling us exactly how many of each type of question we have. We just know for every five open-ended, there are four multiple-choice, or for every four multiple-choice, there are five open-ended. The table shows some numbers of multiple choice questions and total questions that could be on Peni's survey. Based on the ratio, complete the missing values in the table."
Math,"So like always, pause this video and see if you can have a go at this on your own before we work through it together. Alright, so some of you might not have realized that it says total questions here. It does not say multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. So, one way to tackle this is to think about, well, what is going to be the ratio between multiple-choice questions and total questions? So, let's think."
Math,"If we were to create another bar for total questions that showed the ratio, for every five open-ended questions, you'll have four multiple-choice questions and you would have nine total questions. So it would look like this: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine. I'm just adding these two together. So, we could say that the ratio of multiple-choice to total questions is going to be four to nine. For every four multiple-choice questions, you're going to have nine total questions."
Math,"So, in this first row we have eight multiple-choice questions. So, that's two sets of four. So, we're gonna have two sets of nine total questions. That still is the same ratio. Eight is to 18 as four is to nine. And now in the second row they give us the actual number of total questions. Well, that is nine goes into 45 five times. That's five sets of nine. So you're gonna have five sets of four multiple-choice questions. So five times four is 20, and we're done.."
Math,"If you have 36 guests, how many liters of Yoda Soda do you need? So pause this video and try to figure it out on your own. Well, they tell us the ratio of liters of soda to number of guests. So you need five, it's five liters for every 12 guests is the ratio but we wanna have 36 guests. So if the ratio is five liters of soda for every 12 guests but we're in a situation where we have 36 guests, so this is three times as many guests, we're gonna need three times as many liters of soda."
Math,"So three times five is 15. Five to 12. Five liters for 12 guests or for five liters for every 12 guests is the same thing as 15 liters for every 36 guests. So to answer that question, how many liters do you need, you need 15 liters. Let's do another one of these. Here, we just have a picture of a bunch of fish in a tank and it says there are eight big fish for every blank small fish and then it says there are four big fish for every blank small fish."
Math,"So pause this video again and see if you can work through this. Alright, so let's just count the big fish first. So there's one, two, three, wait, let me count this way. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So in this tank, there actually are eight big fish and so let's see how many small fish there are. There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 small fish."
Math,"So in the tank, for every eight big fish which you see in red, there are 10 small fish but here it says, there are four big fish for every blank small fish. So what would that be? Well, one way to think about it is we have half as many fish or half as many big fish so we divided it by two. So we're gonna have half as many small fish. So we're gonna divide by two."
Math,"So for every four big fish, there are five small fish and one way to think about it, you could divide the fish evenly into two groups right over here. So let's see, if we can capture, so if you could have, this is, if I divide it like that, here I have one, two, three, four big fish and one, two, three, four, five small fish then in this group I have one, two, three, four big fish and one, two, three, four, five small fish. So every four big fish, there are five small fish. These are equivalent ratios."
Math,"Let's keep going. So here, we're told an ice cream shop uses the following ingredients to make one sundae. So they use two scoops of ice cream, four spoonfuls of sprinkles, two tablespoons of whipped cream. How many sundaes did the shop make if they used 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles? So pause the video and try to think about it. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. Here, it says, let's see, we're talking about sprinkles. So that's what's relevant here. Four spoonfuls for every one sundae."
Math,"So we could say that there, so the ratio of spoonfuls to sundaes is four to one. Four spoonfuls, spoonfuls of sprinkles, let me write it this way, let me write sprinkles, sprinkles. How many spoonfuls? How many spoonfuls for one sundae? But here we're talking about using 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles so that is eight times as many. So you're going to be able to use, create eight times as many sundaes. So you're gonna have 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles for every eight sundaes."
Math,"So how many sundaes did the shop make? Well, they made eight. Let's do one last example. At a dog park, there are 10 black dogs, five brown dogs, two white dogs and 12 multi-color dogs. For every one brown dog, there are two blank dogs. Pause the video and figure out what goes in this blank. Alright, so let's see."
Math,"There's five brown dogs for every 10 black dogs, five brown dogs for every two white dogs and five brown dogs for every 12 multi-color dogs but here you're saying for every one brown dog, there are two blank dogs. So what type of dog is there a ratio? So for every brown dog, there's twice as many of that type of dog. Well, here, we see for every five brown dogs, there are 10 black dogs. So one way to think about it, the number of black dogs is always gonna be twice the number of brown dogs."
Math,"So for every one brown dog, there would be two, two black, two black dogs. One way to think about it, the ratio between brown dogs and black dogs and it's kinda counterintuitive. I used the wrong colors here. I should have used brown and black. So let me do that."
Math,"So the ratio of brown to black is five brown dogs for every 10, 10 black dogs or if you divide both of these numbers by five, you would get one, one brown dog for every two, for every two black dogs and that's exactly what this statement is saying.."
Math,"All right, so if we wanna think about red paint, it looks like we have every, we have eight parts red paint, and if we think about the ratio of that towards total paint, you might be tempted to put a 12 there. But that's not the total paint, that's just the yellow paint. The total paint for every eight parts red, would be the eight parts red plus the 12 parts yellow. So, it'd be eight plus 12, which is 20. And this is true, the ratio of red paint to the total paint in the mixture is 8:20."
Math,"Now, you might not always see it expressed this way, because there's other ways of writing an equivalent ratio. Some that people would argue are actually simpler. Another way to think about it is this diagram where we see the red paint, it has eight parts right over here, but we could also describe it as four groups of two. Just like that, because eight is divisible by four. And if you divide the 12 parts of yellow into four groups, it's four groups of three."
Math,"And you'll see in a second why this is really interesting, because we were able to break down both of these into four groups. And when you do that, you see very clearly, hopefully, that for every two parts of red you have three parts of yellow. For every two parts of red, you have three parts of yellow. Two parts of red, three parts of yellow, and then last but not least, these two parts of red and then those three parts of yellow. So, for every two parts of red you have three parts yellow."
Math,"Now once again, the ratio that they're asking isn't the ratio of red to yellow, which is two to three, but you could just take one of these groups and say, all right, for every two parts of red I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 parts of total paint. So, you could say that the ratio is also, for every two parts of red, I have five parts of total paint. And hopefully, this makes intuitive sense right here. Why these two things are equivalent."
Math,"If for every eight you have 20 total, well, if you divide that by four for every two of red, you're going to have five.."
Math,"When we have five pounds of avocados, it costs us $9. And so, if you look at any point over here, let's say you look right over here. This would be, let's see, this is one, right? This is one, two, three, four, five. If you look at one, this point on the cost number line would tell you how much one pound of avocado would cost. Two pounds of avocados, how much would that cost? You would look at this second number line right over there."
Math,"So they ask us, based on the ratio shown in the double number line, what is the cost for one pound of avocados? So pause the video and think about it. Remember, one pound of avocados on this top number line, we look at this second number line, the cost would be right over here. What is this going to be? Well, we could just set it up as a ratio. The ratio of pounds of avocados to cost is going to be, let me do this in some colors. So if I have five pounds of avocados, it is going to cost me $9."
Math,"So the ratio of pounds to dollars is five to nine. So if I were to have one pound of avocado, one pound of avocado, I have divided by five to get one pound of avocado. I would have to do the same thing for the cost. So if I divide nine by five, this is going to be nine fifths dollars. Nine fifths dollars would be the cost of one pound."
Math,"Well, nine fifths isn't always the most natural way to write money, so you can view this nine fifths is equal to one and four fifths, which is equal to one and eight 10ths, which is equal to 1.8, or you could say this is $1.80. So if you were to go onto this double number line, the cost of one pound of avocado, this point right over here would be $1.80. If you said two pounds of avocados, well, now you would double it."
Math,"So this would be $3.60, and you would go on and on and on all the way until you got to $9 here. Let's do another example. So here, we are told the double number line shows how many model trains Irene can build in a week. So we can see, in zero weeks she can't build any trains, but in one week she can build nine trains. And they asked us, which table represents the rate of Irene building model trains? So pause this video and see if you can figure it out. So once again, every week she can build nine trains."
Math,"So one way to think about it is the ratio of week to trains would be one to nine. So let's see. If I look at this table, I just wanna see where the ratio between weeks to trains stays at one to nine. So five to 45, that is still one to nine. To go from one to five, I've multiplied by five. And then to go to nine to 45, I've also multiplied by five. So this one checks out. And another way to think about it, is 45 is nine times five. So nine times. That might be an easier way to think about it."
Math,"Over here, 12 to 108, that's, once again, 12 times nine is 108. And then 26 to 234. Let's see, 26 times 10 would be 260, minus 26. Yeah, it would be 234. So this is nine times. So in all of these cases, the ratio of trains or the ratio of weeks to trains is one to nine. So this one is looking good, so I'll just circle that in. But let's just make sure that this one doesn't work. Over here, the ratio of weeks to trains is nine to one, not one to nine."
Math,"The train should be nine times the weeks, while here the weeks is nine times the train. So just looking at that first one, we know that this is not going to work out. Let's do one last example. The double number line shows how many snowballs Jacob and his friends can make in one minute. No minutes, they can make zero snowballs. In one minute, they can make 12. Complete the table to show the same information as the double number line. So once again, pause this video and see if you can work this out."
Math,"Well, we can think about it as a ratio. The ratio of minutes to snowballs is one to 12. So minutes to snowballs is one to 12. Or another way to think about it is, the snowballs is going to be 12 times the minutes. And so over here, if I have 12 snowballs, we already know that's going to be one minute. If I have 48 snowballs, let's just think about it. To go from 12 to 48 you have to multiply by four. So you have four times as many snowballs, it's gonna take you four times as many minutes."
Math,"And then if you go to five, to go from one to five you multiply by five, so you're gonna have five times as many snowballs as you would be able to make in one minute. So five times 12 is 60, and we're done. It could be one to 12, four to 48, five to 60. For every five minutes, you can make 60 snowballs, or they make 60 snowballs.."
Math,"24-- when the numerator is 24, the denominator is 40. So in that way, you could think of 24/40. But then they want us to write equivalent ratios where we have to fill in different blanks over here-- here in the denominator and here in the numerator. And there's a bunch of ways that we could actually tackle this. But maybe the easiest is to start with the ratio that they gave us, where they gave us both the numerator and the denominator, and then move from there."
Math,"So for example, if we look at this one right over here, the numerator is 12. It is half of the 24. So the denominator is also going to be half of the denominator It's going to be half of 40. So we could stick a 20 right over there. And then we could go up here. If you compare the 3 to the 12, to go from 12 to 3, you have to divide by 4. So in the numerator, you're dividing by 4. So in the denominator, you also want to divide by 4. So 20 divided by 4 is 5."
Math,"And then we have one more to fill in, this numerator right over here. And we see from the denominator, we doubled the denominator. We went from 40 to 80. So we would double the numerator as well, and so you would get 48. And what we just did here is we wrote four equivalent ratios. The ratio 3 to 5 or 3/5 is the same thing as 12 to 20, is the same thing as 24 to 40, is the same thing as 48 to 80. Let's make sure we got the right answer. Let's do a couple more of these."
Math,"The following table shows equivalent fractions to 27/75. So then they wrote all of the different equivalent fractions. This table shows ratios equivalent to 18/55. Fair enough. All right, so these are all equivalent to 27/75. These are all equivalent to 18/55, so all of these. Which fraction is greater, 27/75 or 18/55? So this is an interesting thing. What we want to do-- because you look at these two things. And you're like, well, I don't know. Their denominators are different."
Math,"How do I compare them? And the best way that I can think of comparing them is look at a point where you're getting an equivalent fraction. And either the numerators are going to be the same, or the denominators are going to be the same. So let's see if there's any situation here. So you have this situation where we see 27/75 is 54/150. And over here, we see that 18/55 is 54-- and this 54 jumped out at me because it's the same numerator-- over 165. And that makes the comparison much easier."
Math,"What is smaller? 54/150 or 54/165? Well, if you have the same numerator, having a larger denominator will make the number smaller. So 54/165 is smaller than 54/150, which tells us that 18/55 is smaller than 27/75. So let's see, which of these? So this is saying that 27/75 is greater than 18/55, and that is absolutely right. And let's do one more of these. Lunara's friends are running a race. Each of them runs at a constant speed starting at time 0."
Math,"Which of these tables might show the distances one of Lunara's friends traveled over time? So they're running a race. Each of them runs at a constant speed starting at time 0. So table 1-- so distance run in meters. So they're running at a constant speed. So really, the ratio between distance and time should be constant throughout all of these possible tables. So here you have a ratio of 3 to 2. If you triple the distance, we're tripling the time."
Math,"If you multiply the distance by 5, we're multiplying the time by 5. So table 1 seems completely reasonable. Let's keep going. Table 2-- 11 to 4 and then 12 to 5. Here, it's just incrementing by 1, but the ratios are not the same. 11 to 4 is not the same thing as 12 to 5. So we're not going to be able to-- this right over here is not a legitimate table. Table 3-- so 1 to 1. Then when you double the distance, we double the time. When you triple the distance from 1, you didn't triple the time."
Math,"So table 3 doesn't seem to make sense, either. Table 4-- so 14 to 10. So that's the same thing as-- let's see, that's the same ratio as, if we were to divide by 2, as 7 to 5 ratio. If we divide both of these by 3, this is also a 7 to 5 ratio. And if you divide both of these by 7, this is also a 7 to 5 ratio. So table 4 seems like a completely reasonable scenario. And we can check our answer, and it is.."
Math,"So before I even look at these choices, for example, if I have seven to six, if I multiply the seven times two to get 14, then I would also multiply the six times two to get 12. So, for example, 14 to 12 is the exact same ratio. Now you might be tempted to pick 12 to 14, but that is not the same ratio. Order matters in a ratio. This could be ratio of oranges to apples. And we're saying for every seven oranges, there are six apples. You wouldn't be able to say it the other way around."
Math,"So you would rule this one out even though it's dealing with some of the right numbers. It's not in the right order. Now let's think about 21 to 18. To go from seven to 21, we would multiply by three. And to go from six to 18, you would also multiply by three. So that works. If we multiply both of these numbers by three, we get 21 to 18. So let me circle that in. That one is for sure equivalent. What about 42 to 36? Well, to go from seven to 42, we're going to have to multiply by six."
Math,"And to go from six to thirty-six, we also multiply by six. So this, once again, is an equivalent ratio. We multiply each of these by six and we keep the same order. So that is equivalent right over there. 63 to 54. Let's see, to go from seven to 63, you multiply by nine. And to go from six to 54, you also multiply by nine. So once again, 63 to 54 is an equivalent ratio. And so we've already selected three, but let's just verify that this doesn't work. So to go from seven to 84, you would multiply by 12."
Math,"To go from six to 62, you multiply by 10 and 2/6 or 10 1/3, so this one is definitely not an equivalent ratio. Let's do another example. So once again, we are asked to select three ratios that are equivalent to 16 to 12. So pause this video and see if you can work through it. Alright, let's look at this first one. So eight to six. So at first you might say well, gee, these numbers are smaller than 16 and 12."
Math,"Remember, you can, to get an equivalent ratio you can multiply or divide these numbers by the same number. So, to get from 16 to eight, you could do that as, well, we just divided by two. And to go from 12 to six, you also divide by two. So this actually is an equivalent ratio. I'll circle that in. What about 32 to 24? Well to go from 16 to 32, we multiply by two. To go from 12 to 24, we also multiply by two. So this is an equivalent ratio."
Math,"What about four to three? Well, to go from 16 to four, we would have to divide by four. And to go from 12 to three, we are going to divide by four as well. So we're dividing by the same thing, each of these numbers. So, this is also going to be an equivalent ratio. So we've selected our three, so we are essentially done. But, we might as well see why these don't work. Now let's think about it. To go from 16 to 12, how do we do that? Well, to go from 16 to 12, you could divide by four and multiply by three."
Math,"So this would be times 3/4. You would get 12. And to go from 12 to eight, so you could divide by three and multiply by two. So this you could view as times 2/3. So you'd be multiplying or dividing by different numbers here, so this one is not equivalent. And then 24 to 16? To go from 16 to 24, you would multiply by, let's see, that's 1 1/2. So this right over here would be, you would multiply by 1 1/2. And to go from 12 to 16, you would multiply, that is, by 1 1/3. So, times 1 1/3."
Math,"So you're not multiplying by the same amount. So once again, not an equivalent ratio.."
Math,"But, you only have 16 guests coming over. So, if you only have 16 guests coming over, what should be your ingredients here? How much of each of these ingredients should you have? I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Right now, we're gonna think about, well, we're gonna have a slightly smaller super cake. Smaller super, super cake."
Math,"You might have reasoned that, ""Look, if we're going to have half as many guests, ""then each of the ingredients, ""we should just have half as much."" And you would be right. Instead of eight eggs, for our smaller super cake, you could have four eggs. Instead of six cups of flour, in our smaller super cake, you could have three cups of flour. Instead of six cups of sugar, you could have three cups of sugar. I'm just taking half of each of these numbers."
Math,"Instead of two cups of butter, you could have one cup of butter. Instead of six teaspoons of baking soda, you could have three teaspoons of baking soda. And, last but not least, instead of two cups of water, you could have one cup of water. Now, this will work and this is actually how you should adjust recipes. But there's something interesting about what's similar about these two recipes. The recipe for the main super cake that feeds 32 people and the recipe for the smaller super cake."
Math,"And that's the notion of ratios. The ratios between ingredients or the ratio of how much of an ingredient you need for given guests. For example, you can see here that for every eight eggs, you have six cups of flour. So, let me write this down. So, for eight eggs we have six cups of flour. We have six cups of flour. Which can be expressed as a ratio of, the ratio of eggs to flour is 8:6. Which is, once again, interpreted as for every eight eggs, I have six cups of flour."
Math,"If I said for every six cups of flour, I have eight eggs, I would've written 6:8. So, the order here matters. But here I'm saying the ratio of eggs to flour, of eggs to cups of flour is 8:6. For every eight eggs, I have six cups of flour. Well, what about for the smaller cake? Well, here, for every four eggs, for every four eggs, we have three cups of flour. We have three cups of flour. So, what would this ratio be? Well, for every four eggs, we have three cups of flour."
Math,"So, the ratio of eggs to flour is 4:3. Now, turns out that these are the exact same ratio. If you have eight eggs for every six cups of flour, or for every eight eggs you have six cups of flour, that's the same thing as for every four eggs, you have three cups of flour. What you're just doing is taking each of these numbers and you are dividing it by two. So, you could say the ratio in either case, the ratio of eggs to flour, let me write this down. The ratio of eggs, to two cups of flour."
Math,"Let me write two cups of flour. Cups of flour. In either case is, is four eggs for every three cups of flour. This is going to be true for either recipe. You have the same ratio. If you have eight eggs here, so, for every four eggs, you have three cups of flour. Well, that means your going to have six cups of flour. This is why ratios are helpful. This recipe has a different number of eggs, a different number of cups of flour, a different number of cups of sugar."
Math,"But the ratios between the ingredients are the same. So, you will be able to have a cake that tastes the same, that essentially is the same cake but just is a different size.."
Math,"All right, now let's think about the ratios of honey to mustard at each of these restaurants. So first let's think about the scenario with Burger Barn. So I'll just say BB for short, for Burger Burn. So they have two spoonfuls of honey for every one half spoonful of mustard, so the ratio of honey to mustard in terms of spoonfuls is two spoonfuls of honey for every one half spoonful of mustard, so this is the ratio of honey to mustard. Let me write this. This is honey, and this right over here is mustard."
Math,"Now, let's look at Sandwich Town, so I'll call that ST. So Sandwich Town makes dipping sauce by having four spoonfuls of honey for every one spoonful of mustard. So the ratio of honey to mustard is four spoonfuls to one spoonful, so once again, that is honey and that is mustard. Now, can we make these equivalent ratios or can we compare them somehow? Well, let's see. We have one half spoonful of mustard here."
Math,"We have one spoon of mustard here, so what if we multiplied both the mustard and the honey spoonfuls by two? That still would be an equivalent ratio because we're multiplying by the same amount. So if we multiply by two in both situations, you have four spoonfuls of honey for every one spoonful of mustard. Well, that's the exact same ratio that we have at Sandwich Town. So it actually turns out that they have the same concentration of mustard. They have the same ratio of honey to mustard."
Math,"Four spoonfuls of honey for every spoonful of mustard in either situation. Let's do another example. So here, we are asked or we are told, we are told, Patrick's favorite shade of purple paint is made with four ounces of blue paint, so underline that in blue, four ounces of blue paint, for every three ounces of red paint, for every three ounces of red paint. So the ratio of blue paint to red paint is four ounces of blue, four ounces of blue, for every three ounces of red, so four to three."
Math,"Which of the following paint mixtures will create the same shade of purple? All right, pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. So this is three ounces of blue paint mixed with four ounces of red paint. Well, this is a ratio here of three to four, and even though it's dealing with the same numbers, this is a different ratio. The order matters. This is four ounces of blue for every three ounces of red."
Math,"This is saying three ounces of blue for every four ounces of red, so we could rule this one out. Eight ounces of blue paint mixed with six ounces of red paint. So here, this ratio is eight ounces of blue for every six ounces of red. Well, are these equivalent ratios? Well, the difference, or you can go, if you multiply by two in either case, you will get to eight to six. Four times two is eight, three times two is six. So this is indeed an equivalent ratio, so we would select this one."
Math,"All right, here they say six ounces of blue paint mixed with eight ounces of red paint. So this is, they've swapped the blues and the red relative to this one, so this is a ratio of six to eight, so let me write this down. So this is a ratio, six ounces of blue paint for every eight ounces of red paint. So just like we ruled out that first one, this is dealing with the same numbers but in a different order and the order matters, so we'll rule that out."
Math,"20 ounces of blue paint, 20 ounces of blue paint, for every 15 ounces of red paint. So are these equivalent? Well, let's think about it. To go from four to 20, you can multiply by five, and to go from three to 15, you could multiply by five, so we can multiply by the same factor to go from four to three to 20 to 15, so this is indeed an equivalent ratio. 12 ounces of blue paint mixed with 16 ounces of red paint. All right, so this is a ratio here of 12 ounces of blue for every 16 ounces of red."
Math,"So let's think about this. To go from four to 12, you would multiply by three. Now, if you multiplied three by three, you would have a nine here, not a 16, so this is definitely not an equivalent ratio."
Math,"Another way of thinking about it, you have, in terms of ounces, you have more ounces of blue than you have of red for any of the equivalent ratios, but here you have more ounces of red than blue, so once again, another way of realizing that that is not equivalent, so only B and D are the equivalent mixtures that will provide the same shade of purple. To have that same shade, you need the same ratio of blue to red.."
Math,"Alright, now let's do this together. So for Akeem, the ratio of the ground pepper to filets is 19 grams for every four filets. And for Tisha it is 25 grams for every six catfish. So what we wanna do is say, all right who has more grams maybe for given amount of filets? So unfortunately they don't give us the same amount of filets here. We have four filets here and six filets over here."
Math,"But what if we set up a table where we just try to make each of them make more and more filets and we just see how much of the ground pepper each of them will use. And if we get to a point where they're using the same amount of filets then, and if one of 'em is using more ground pepper then there's going to have a stronger pepper taste. So let's say this is Akeem right over here. Akeem, and this is Tisha, and this is grams of pepper. So pepper in grams, and this is filets."
Math,"And then this is for Tisha, pepper in grams. And this is filets. So we already know that when if Akeem were to make exactly four filets then their going to use 19 grams. If, let's keep going from there. If we double the amount of filets well we're gonna double the amount of grams we're going to get to 38 grams. If we were to add another four filets to that, so now we're at 12 filets, well what's that going to be to go from four to 12, you multiply by three."
Math,"Well that means you would take that 19 and multiply by three. Let's see, that would be 30 plus 27. That would be 57. Maybe this is enough. Let's see what we can do for Tisha right over here. So when Tisha makes six filets then she's going to use 25 grams. What if we double it to 12 filets? And this is interesting because we have 12 filets here. Well then we would double the pepper to 50 grams. So we have set up actually a really nice comparison."
Math,"If Akeem makes 12 filets their going to use 57 grams of pepper. While if Tisha makes the exact same number of filets their going to use only 50 grams of pepper. So for 12 filets, Akeem would clearly use more pepper and therefore would have a stronger pepper taste. So Akeem's filets have the stronger pepper taste.."
Math,"So if you have two batches how many cups of flour would that be? Pause the video and try to figure it out. Well if he has twice as many batches, he's gonna have twice the number of cups of flour. So instead of eight, it would be 16 cups of flour. And if he had three times the number of batches, it would be three times the number of cups of flour. So instead of eight, it would be eight times three, or 24. Now down here, they say plot the ordered pairs x comma y from the table on the following graph."
Math,"So we wanna graph one batch, eight cups, two batches, 16 cups, three batches, 24 cups. So let's do that. Let's see if we can, okay. So right here, I'm assuming on the horizontal axis that is our batches, and then our vertical axis is cups of flour. So for every batch, we need eight cups of flour. So one batch, this is eight right over here, five, six, seven, eight, and then for two batches, we're going to need 16 cups of flour so that puts us right over there, that's 16."
Math,"And then for three batches, we are going to need 24 cups of flour, and that actually goes slightly off of our screen here, let me scroll up a little bit. So for three batches, we're going to have to bring that to 24 which is right here and I can see the 25 right above that. And what you'll see, because the ratio between our batches and our cups of flour are constant, that all of these points, you could connect them all with one straight line because we have a fixed ratio."
Math,"Every time we move one to the right, we're gonna move eight up. Every time we add another batch, we're gonna have eight more cups of flour, every time we add a batch, eight more cups of flour. Lets do another example. Here we're told Drew earns money washing cars for his neighbors on the weekends. Drew charges a set rate for each car he washes. The points on the following coordinate plane show how much Drew charges for two, five, and eight cars. So let's see what's going on over here."
Math,"So when he washes two cars, he looks like he charges $15. When he washes five cars, it looks like he's charging, well it looks like some place between 35 and $40, and he charges eight cars, it looks like he's charging $60. So one way to think about it is the ratio between the number of cars he's washing and the dollars, it stays at two to 15, notice two cars, for every $15. I guess I could say $15 for every two cars."
Math,"And so, when you go to eight cars, you're multiplying by four the number of cars and you're also multiplying by four the number of dollars. And so once again, since we have a fixed ratio here, all three of these points sit on the same line. But then they ask us down here, they say how much does Drew charge for four cars? Well if it's $15 for two cars, well then four cars would be twice as much. So it would be $30 for four cars. We have the same ratio. Let's do one more example."
Math,"Here we're told McKenna earns money each time she shovels snow for her neighbors, as she should. McKenna plots points on the coordinate plane below to show how much she earns for different numbers of times she shovels snow. Alright. So let's see, when she shovels snow three times, looks like she gets, halfway between 16 and 20, looks like she gets $18, four times, looks like it's $24, so looks like the ratio is staying constant at three to 18."
Math,"The ratio of three to 18 is the same thing as, one way to think about it is $18 for every three times she shovels snow, that would be equivalent of six dollars for every time she shovels snow. So let's go down here to see what they're asking us. They say which of the following ordered pairs could McKenna add to the graph? So this would be one times she shoveling snow, would she get $10 for it. So does she get $10 for every time she shovels snow? No, that wouldn't be consistent with the data here."
Math,"She got $18 for shoveling snow three times. So that looks like she's getting six dollars for every time she shovels snow. So I would rule out choice A, choice B, shoveling snow twice, she gets $12. Well that makes sense, if she gets six dollars every time she shovels snow. If the ratio of shoveling of the times to the dollars is three to 18 or one to six, that would be equivalent to two to 12 and we would pick that choice.."
Math,"Let's see, to go from 168 to 1,176, what do we have to multiply by? So, let's see, that looks like we might be multiplying by seven. Let me try that out. So 168 times seven is equal to... Eight times seven is 56, six times seven is 42 plus five is 47, and then one times seven plus four is indeed 1,176. So we multiplied by seven, we multiplied the number of hours by seven, so that means we're gonna have seven times as many weeks. So, one times seven is just that is seven weeks."
Math,"Now, what about a situation where we have three weeks, how many hours is that going to be? Well we are multiplying our weeks by three, so we would wanna multiply our hours. We would wanna multiply our hours times three. So, 168 times three, eight times three is 24, six times three is 18, plus two is 20, and then one times three is three, plus two is five. So, that would be 504 hours. Let's do another example. So, here they tell us the double number lines show the ratio of yards to miles."
Math,"So, the ratio of yards to miles. It looks like we have 3,520 yards for every two miles. For every two miles, and you see that on this double number line right over here. Then they say how may yards are in five miles? So, why don't you pause this video and try to figure it out. Well the way my brain wants to do it is, well let's just think about how many yard are in each mile. So, if the ratio's 3,520:2, how could I rewrite this ratio so it is how many yards for every one mile."
Math,"So, to go from two to one, I am dividing by two, so I would wanna divide this by two as well. So, two goes into 3,520, let's see, two goes into three one time, one times two is two, you subtract, you bring down the five. Two goes into 15 seven times, seven times two is 14, subtract, we have one, bring down that two, two goes into 12 six times, six times two is 12, and we subtract, no remainder, but then we're gonna have one more zero here, cuz we bring down that zero."
Math,"We say two goes into zero zero times, zero times two is zero, and we have no remainder, and so this is 1,760. So, we could put that here on our double number lines. So, if we have one mile that is 1,760 yards. Now, they're asking about five miles, so three, four, five, so we have five miles. What is the number of yards? Well if you multiply by five here, you're also going to multiply by five right over there. So, what's 1,760 times five? Well just figure it out."
Math,"1,760 times five, five times zero is zero, five times six is 30. Regroup that three cuz it's really 300s, five times seven is 35, plus three is 38, five times one is five, plus three is eight. So, there you go, 8,800 yards. Let's do a few more examples. Here, we're told there are 914.4 millimeters in a yard. There are three feet in a yard."
Math,"How many millimeters are in a foot? Okay, so one way to think about it, you could say there's 914.4 millimeters per yard, or you could say 914.4 millimeters per three feet, since three feet and a yard is the same thing. So, if you wanna know per foot, you would just divide both of these by three. So, let's do that, and I'll just do it in a different color here."
Math,"Three goes into 914.4, Three goes into nine three times, three times three is nine, subtract, we get a zero bring down the one, three goes into one zero times, zero times three is zero, subtract, get a one, and bring down that four, three goes into 14 four times, gonna have this decimal right over here, four times three is 12, you subtract, and then, so you get a two, bring down this four, you get a 24, and lucky for us, three goes perfectly into 24 eight times, eight times three is 24, 24 you subtract, now we have no remainder."
Math,"So, we have 304.8 millimeters for every foot. Let's do one last example. So pause this video and see if you can figure it out. So, let's just write this out in words. So, it's $12 per pound of confetti. So, you could do this as $12 per 16 ounces. 16 ounces of confetti, and so if we want it per ounce. So, you could do this as a 12 to 16 ratio, but we wanna say something to one ratio. So, if you say per one ounce, well we're dividing by 16 there, so we would wanna divide by 16 as well."
Math,"So, this is going to be 12 divided by 16. So, 12 divided by... Well let me write it over here. So 12 divided by 16 is the same thing as 3/4, just divide both of them by four, and so this is 0.75, or 75 cents, 75 cents per ounce, or 75 hundredths of a dollar per ounce. So, 0.75, and we're done.."
Math,"Alright, now let's work through this together. And I'm going to figure this out by setting up a little bit of a table. So we have our indoor, indoor play times. I'll write it out. Play times. We have our outdoor play times. Outdoor play times. Then we have our total play times. Total play times. And then, let me set up a table here as promised, and then, I'm going to set up two columns here. So the first column is going to concern itself with the ratios."
Math,"So this is the original, original ratio, and here, we're going to put the actual counts. Actual counts. So what information do we know? We know that the ratio of indoor to outdoor is two to three. So the ratio of indoor to outdoor is two to three. And then we could also think about what would be the ratio of either of these to total play times? Well, for every two indoor play times, there are three outdoor play times."
Math,"That means for every two indoor play times, there are five total play times, or for every three outdoor play times, there are five total play times. And now, let's think about what we know about the actual counts. They tell us that there was a 30 total actual play times. So this is the actual number is 30. Now this is useful because now we can think about how do we go from the original ratios to the actual counts? If we take the total, we notice that we are multiplying by six."
Math,"So to maintain the ratios, we would want to multiply everything by six. So if you multiply this by six, you're going to have 12 actual indoor play times. And if you multiply this by six, you're going to have 18 actual outdoor play times. And notice, the ratio still holds up. Two is to three as 12 is to 18 or two is to five as 12 is to 30. And so, there we have it. We know how many of the play times were indoors, 12, and how many were outdoors, 18.."
Math,"And I encourage you to pause the video and try to do it on your own. So I'm assuming you have tried to do it on your own. And now let's see how we could actually tackle this. Now, one thing I want to point out, some of you all might have seen these numbers all lined up and immediately want to say, hey, 7 plus 1 is 8, and 8 plus 3 is 11, carry the 1, et cetera, et cetera. And if you did that, you would be making a mistake. Because, you see, right over here, these decimals aren't lined up."
Math,"Here, if you did that, you would be adding the 7 thousandths to 1 hundredths. You would be adding 0 tenths to 5 ones. You would be adding 9 to 1 tens, or essentially, this is a 10 right over here. So the places would be all mixed up. So what you need to do is to actually align the decimals so that your place values are aligned. So what you want to do is you want to align things up. So we could write 9.087. And then we want to align the decimal. So let's align the decimal. This is what has to match up."
Math,"And this is going to be 15.31. And this should hopefully make sense to you as well. This is 9 point something plus 15 point something so it's going to be-- If you add 9 to 15, it will be 24 point something, give or take a little bit. And you see that here. Here you have a 9 plus the 15. So you have lined up the appropriate place values. And now we are ready to add."
Math,"It's a good idea to start with the smallest place value, so if you have any extra at a certain place, you can bring something into the next place value. So here you say 7 plus-- well, this is 7 thousandths. It's in the thousandths place. And you might want to-- you say, well, what do I add it to? There are no thousandths right over here. And you're right. There are no thousandths. So we could literally write 0 thousandths. So 7 thousandths plus 0 thousandths is 7 thousandths."
Math,"8 hundredths plus 1 hundredth is 9 hundredths. 0 plus 0 tenths plus 3 tenths is 3 tenths. We got our decimal. Then you have 9 ones plus 5 ones is 14 ones. Well, 14 ones is the same thing as 4 ones and 1 ten. So we'll carry that 1 right over there. This is just 1 ten plus 4 ones, which is 14. And so then finally, you have 1 ten plus another ten is 2. So we get 24.397.."
Math,"So let me rewrite this. And when I rewrite it, I want to line up the decimals so that we add the right place to the right place. And so we could write either number first, although I like to write the larger number first. So let's write 5.65. And remember, the important thing is that we line up the decimal points. So if we write 0.822-- so we line up the decimal. Let me line up the decimal first. So I'll write the decimal right below the other decimal. And it is 0.822. And now we are ready to add."
Math,"So let's see what's going on here. So I like to start in the smallest place. That way, the carrying works out well. So you might say, wait, I need to add this 2 thousandths to something. I don't see anything up here. Well, you could say there's just a 0 thousandths right up here. Then it makes it very clear. Well, 0 thousandths plus 2 thousandths is going to be 2 thousandths. 5 hundredths plus 2 hundredths is 7 hundredths. 6 tenths plus 8 tenths is 14 tenths."
Math,"Well, 14 tenths is the same thing as 4 tenths and 1 one. Another way of thinking about it is you're carrying the 1. But really, what you're saying is, look, this is 14 tenths. I could write it as 4 tenths and a 1, or a ones place, a 1 in a ones place. Then you have 1 plus 5 is 6. And of course, you cannot forget the decimal. The decimal goes right there. And this is 6.472.."
Math,"Now when you're adding any number, you always want to make sure you line up numbers in the same place. And especially when you're dealing with decimals, the easiest way to do that is to just line up the decimals. So let's do that. So the first number right here is 7.056. This second number right here is 605.7. And then this last number is 5.67. So now we have everything lined up. Everything that's in the ones place is below or above everything else in the ones place."
Math,"Everything in the tenths place is below or above everything else in the tenths place, and so on and so forth. So we can add. So let's add it. So you want to start off in the smallest place. So you start off here. This is the tenths, hundredths, thousandths place. This is literally 6 thousandths, and you want to add it to the other thousandths. There aren't any other thousandths. So you can view it two ways. You can just bring in this 6 down, or you could view this 605.7 as the same thing as 605.700."
Math,"You can add as many zeroes to the right of this decimal, to the right of the 7, as you want, since we're sitting on the right side of the decimal, without changing its value. You can also do it here. This 5.67, you can write it as 5.670. When you write it like this, and you have 6 plus 0 plus 0 is 6. And you keep going. 5 plus 0 plus 7 is 12. You write the 2 in the hundredths place, and carry the 1. 1 plus 0 plus 7 is 8, plus 6 is 14. Write the 4, regroup the 1 into the ones place. 1 plus 7 is 8."
Math,"8 plus 5 is 13. 13 plus 5 is 18. This is 18. Carry or regroup the 1. 1 plus 0 is just 1. And then finally. You have the 6 in the hundreds place. Nothing gets added to it, so you can just bring down that 6 and it's right there. And you don't want to forget the decimal. And so when you add the numbers you get 618.426, or 618 and 426 thousandths. And we're done.."
Math,"Whenever you do a subtracting decimals problem, the most important thing, and this is true when you're adding decimals as well, is you have to line up the decimals. So this is 9.005 minus 3.6. So we've lined up the decimals, and now we're ready to subtract. Now we can subtract. So we start up here. We have 5 minus nothing. You can imagine this 3.6, or this 3 and 6 tenths, we could add two zeroes right here, and it would be the same thing as 3 and 600 thousandths, which is the same thing as 6 tenths."
Math,"And when you look at it that way, you'd say, OK, 5 minus 0 is nothing, and you just write a 5 right there. Or you could have said, if there's nothing there, it would have been 5 minus nothing is 5. Then you have 0 minus 0, which is just 0. And then you have a 0 minus 6. And you can't subtract 6 from 0. So we need to get something into this space right here, and what we essentially are going to do is regroup. We're going to take one 1 from the 9, so let's do that."
Math,"So let's take one 1 from the 9, so it becomes an 8. And we need to do something with that one 1. We're going to put it in the tenths place. Now remember, one whole is equal to 10 tenths. This is the tenths place. So then this will become 10. Sometimes it's taught that you're borrowing the 1, but you're really taking it, and you're actually taking 10 from the place to your left. So one whole is 10 tenths, we're in the tenths place. So you have 10 minus 6. Let me switch colors. 10 minus 6 is 4."
Math,"You have your decimal right there, and then you have 8 minus 3 is 5. So 9.005 minus 3.6 is 5.405.."
Math,"All right, I'm assuming you've given a go at it, so now let's work through it together. So I'm going to rewrite this. It's 39.1 minus-- I'm going to line up the decimals so that I have the right place values below the right place values-- minus-- this 0 is in the ones place, so I'll put it in the ones place-- 0.794. And now we're ready to subtract. Now, how do we subtract 4 from nothingness here, and 9 from nothingness here? Well, the same thing as nothing is a 0."
Math,"And so now we can start to think about how to subtract. Well, we still have the problem. Well, we're trying to subtract 4 from 0, so we're trying to subtract 9 from 0. So what we could do is take this one tenth and try to regroup it into the hundredths place and the thousandths place. So let's think about this. If we make this-- actually that's not actually going to solve our problem. Well we could do it, but then we're going to have zero tenths, and we're still going to have a problem here."
Math,"So actually let me go to the ones place. So let me get rid of a ones, so that's eight ones, which is going to be 10 tenths. So that's going to now-- we're going to have 11 tenths. The 10 tenths from here plus 1 is 11 tenths. Now let's take one of those tenths so that we have 10 tenths, and give it to the hundredths. So that's going to be 10 hundredths. And now let's take one of those hundredths-- so now we have nine hundredths-- and give it to the thousandths. So that's going to be 10 thousandths."
Math,"Now we're ready to subtract. So 10-- let me do this in yellow-- 10 minus 4 is 6. 9 minus 9 is 0. 10 minus 7 is 3. We have our decimal point. 8 minus 0 is 8. And then we have 3 minus nothing is 3. So we're done, 38.306.."
Math,"How much did the babies weigh in total? So they tell us Nadia weighed 7.27 and Vanessa weighed 8.34. We have to add those up. And really, they just gave us this. The length of Nadia at birth really is a distraction, just so that we just don't mindlessly add any numbers we see. So this is really unnecessary information just to distract us. So we need to add Nadia's birth weight plus Vanessa's. So it's 7.27. So 7.27 plus 8.34. And it's always important that we line up the decimal."
Math,"And I'd like to do the decimal first. So it's 8.34. And we'll just add these two up. So 7 plus 4, and this is really 7/100 plus 4/100 is 11/100, which is the same thing as 1/100 and 1/10. 1/10 plus 2/10 plus 3/10 is 6/10. We've got our decimal sign right over there. And then 7 plus 8 is 15, or you could even say it's five 1's and one 10. And we're done. They weighed 15.61 pounds in total.."
Math,"withdraws $300 in cash. How much is left in his account? So he's starting with $4,522.08. Let's write that down. $4,522.08. And then he deposits, or he adds, another $875.50. So he's going to add $875.50. When you deposit into an account, you're putting something into the account, or you're adding to the account. So after he adds that $875.50, what does he have? We go back to the penny spot, or we could view that as the hundredths. A penny is one hundredth of a dollar. Let me switch colors."
Math,"We have 8 plus 0 is 8. 0 plus 5 is 5. We have the decimal right there. 2 plus 5 is 7. 2 plus 7 is 9. 5 plus 8 is 13. Put the 3 down here and regroup the 1, or carry the 1. 1 plus 4 is 5. So after the $875.50 deposit, he has $5,397.58. Then he withdraws $300 in cash, or he takes out $300, so we'll have to subtract that. So then he withdraws $300 and I just added some trailing zeroes after the decimal. $300 is the same thing as $300.00 and zero cents. And then we subtract. 8 minus 0 is 8. 5 minus 0 is 5."
Math,"We have our decimal right there. 7 minus 0 is 7. 9 minus 0 is 9. 3 minus 3 is 0, and then 5 minus nothing here is 5. So he's the left with, in his account, $5,097.58.."
Math,"We can first do it in a conceptual way, think about it visually. To do that, let me represent 2/3, so let's say that what I'm drawing right over here is a whole. This is a square, and it represents a whole. Now, I can divide into three equal sections. I'm gonna try to hand-draw that. So, this is, that looks pretty good, three equal sections here. Each is 1/3, and we have 2/3, so we are really representing all of this stuff right over here. That is two of my thirds. Now, I wanna divide those 2/3 by five."
Math,"Well, the way I could do this is I could divide it into five equal sections. But, if I'm doing it, I might as well just divide everything, all the thirds, into five equal sections, so let me do that. So, one, two, three, and then four, and five equal sections. So, what is one of those five equal sections of my original 2/3? Well, this right over here is one of those five equal sections of my original 2/3."
Math,"Notice I could draw that, I could draw another one here, another one here, another one there, and another one there, and I would have five equal sections that make up those 2/3. But, what does just one of them represent? And if we figure out what this represents of the whole, then we know what 2/3 divided by five is. Well, when I took my thirds and I divided them into five equal sections, I essentially constructed 15ths."
Math,"How do I know that? Well, I had one, two, three thirds, and then I divided it into one, two, three, four, five sections, so each of these squares right over here is a 15th. You have three times five, and you could count 'em if you like. And, what we have circled off in red is two of these 15ths. We have 1/15 right over here, and then 2/15 right over there. So, this is going to be equal to 2/15."
Math,"Now, another way that you could think about, and over time this is the way you will approach it, but it's nice to think about it conceptually, when you divide by any number, it's the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. So, five is the same thing as five wholes, or 5/1. And so, 2/3 divided by five is the same thing as 2/3 times the reciprocal of five, or the reciprocal of 5/1, which is you just swap the numerator and the denominator, which is 1/5."
Math,"And so, another way of thinking about this is this is 1/5 of 2/3, which it once again will be this section right over here. The way you could compute this, conceptually, you see that this is 2/15, but you could also say well, I could just multiply it. When I multiply fractions I can just multiply the numerators. Two times one is two. We do that same red color. Two times one is two, and then I could multiply the denominators. Three times five is 15."
Math,"And, hopefully, what we just drew out may help make sense of why dividing by something is the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. Then, when you multiply fractions, it's the same thing as multiplying the numerators to get our new numerator, and then multiplying the denominators to get our new denominator.."
Math,"If I had the fraction 5/6, the reciprocal of that is going to be six over five. And that's all well and good, but what does this actually mean? Well, one interpretation of a reciprocal is it's the number that when you multiply it by the original number, you get one. So 2/3 times 3/2 we'll see is equal to one or 5/6 times 6/5 is equal to one."
Math,"Another way to think about reciprocals are, how many of that number or how many of that fraction fit into one? So if I were to take one and I divide it by 2/3, one interpretation of this is saying how many 2/3 fit into one. If I take one divided by 5/6, an interpretation of this is how many 5/6 fit into one. And we'll see that 3/2 of a 2/3 fit into one. And we'll see that in a second. Or that 6/5 of a 5/6 fit into one. So let's start with a very straightforward example."
Math,"Let's say that I have the fraction 1/2. So if I have 1/2. If that whole rectangle is a whole, this is 1/2 here. So if I were to ask how many one halves fit into one, so one divided by 1/2. How many one halves fit into one? Well, I have one 1/2 right it over here. And then I would have another 1/2 right over there. So we have two 1/2. So this is equal to two."
Math,"Now you might be saying, wait, two doesn't look like I just swapped the numerator and the denominator but you have to realize that two is the same thing as two wholes. So the reciprocal of 1/2 is indeed two over one. Or if you take two over one, or if you have two 1/2, that is indeed going to be equal to one. But now let's work on 2/3, things that are a little bit more nuanced. So 2/3 here, I can shade that in. That's 1/3 and then 2/3. So this right over here is 2/3."
Math,"Now how many of these fit into one? If we were to say what's one divided by 2/3? Well, we can clearly get a whole 2/3 into one and then we can get another third, which is half of a 2/3. So we can have a whole 2/3 and then half of a 2/3, or one and a half 2/3. So we could say one divided by 2/3 is equal to one and a half. Well, one and a half is the exact same thing as three halves. So once again, you can see that 3/2 times 2/3 is equal to one or that 3/2 of a 2/3 fit into one. Let's do another example."
Math,"If we were to think about 3/2. So 3/2 would be, let's see that's a half, that's two halves, and then this is three halves right over here. So let me mark all of that. So this whole thing right over here is 3/2. Now how many 3/2 fit into a whole? Well, you can see that you can't even fit a whole 3/2 into a whole. You can only fit two of the three halves. So one half, two halves of the three halves. So what you can see here is that this is 2/3 of the 3/2."
Math,"So if you say one divided by 3/2, how many 3/2 can fit into one? Well, you can only fit 2/3 of a 3/2 into one. And this is interesting because the reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2, and the reciprocal of 3/2 is 2/3.."
Math,"Well, what you need to realize is this is the same thing. 4 could be written as a fraction as 4 over 1. So 4 over 1 times 3/2, and we've multiplied fractions before. To do that, you just multiply the numerators. 4 times 3 is equal to 12, and you multiply the denominators. 1 times 2 is equal to 2. 12/2, well that's the same thing as 6. This is the same thing as 12 divided by 2, but a key question is why does this make sense."
Math,"You know, I said dividing by something is the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. And to think about that, let's draw four wholes. So let me draw it in the same red color. So let's say that this is one whole right over here. This is two wholes. This is three wholes. And then this is four wholes. So I have four wholes there. And imagine splitting it up into groups that are each 2/3 of a whole. So actually, let me just divide everything into 1/3s real fast."
Math,"So I'm gonna divide everything into 1/3s, into 1/3s. So I'm gonna make each group a different color. So here's one group that is 2/3. Here's another group that is 2/3. Here is another group that is, or another section, that I could say, that represents 2/3. Here is another section that represents 2/3. Here is another section. Folks, let me do that in a different color. Here is, here is another section that can represent 2/3 if I take those two blue 1/3s together."
Math,"That's 2/3, and then last but not least, I have another 2/3. So how many sections that are each 2/3 large do I have? Well, I have one, and then these is two, and then I have three, and then I have four, and then these two combined make a, make my fifth section that is 2/3 large, and then finally, I have six. So I have six. I can take four wholes and split it into six equal sections that are each 2/3 of a whole. So 4 divided into sections that are 2/3 of a whole, you will get 6 sections.."
Math,"All right, so let's look at 7/5. 7/5 is everything from here, all the way to there. And then one is this. So how many 7/5 are in one? Well, you can see that one, which is the same thing as 5/5, is less than 7/5. So it's actually going to be a fraction of a 7/5 that is one, or that is in one. And you can see what that fraction is. One is what fraction of 7/5. Well, if you look at the fifths, 7/5 is of course seven of them, and a whole is 5/5, so five of the 7/5 make a whole."
Math,"So the answer right over here is 5/7. 5/7 of a 7/5 is equal to one. You can also see this right over here. If you take each of these to be a fifth, each of these to be a fifth, then this whole bar is equal to 7/5. And the blue part is equal to one. So how many 7/5 are in the blue part? Well, we can see it's 5/7 of the whole bar. Once again, 5/7 of the whole bar. So we can also think about this as one divided by 7/5."
Math,"This is another way of saying how many 7/5 are in one, or how many groups of 7/5 are in one? And this is equal to 5/7, which we've learned in other videos is the reciprocal of 7/5. The numerator and the denominator is swapped. So now what is eight divided by 7/5 going to be? Well, if one divided by 7/5 is 5/7, or if you have 5/7 of a 7/5, of a 7/5 in one, I know the oral language gets a little bit confusing. Well, you're going to have eight times that many in eight."
Math,"So this is going to be the same thing as eight times, we could do it this way, eight times one, divided by 7/5. Or you could just view this as eight times the reciprocal of 7/5, which is five over seven. And we've learned how to multiply this before. Eight times 5/7 is going to be equal to 40/7, and we're done. You could obviously also write that as a mixed number if you like, this would be the same thing as 5 5/7."
Math,"So the big picture is when we think about how many of a fraction are in one, that's the same thing as saying, what's one divided by that fraction? As you see visually here, you essentially get the reciprocal of that fraction. And so if you take any other number other than one divided by that fraction, you're essentially just gonna multiply it by that reciprocal, because it's that number times one. So when you divide by that fraction, it's that number times the reciprocal.."
Math,"This is 0. This is 1. And this is 2. Maybe this is 3 right over here. And let me plot 8/3. So to do that, I just need to break up each whole into thirds. So let's see. That's 1/3, 2/3, 3/3, 4/3, 5/3, 6/3, 7/3, 8/3. So right over here. And then of course, 9/3 would get us to 3. So this right over here is 8/3. Now, one way to think about 8/3 divided by 3 is what if we take this length."
Math,"And we say, how many jumps would it take to get there, if we're doing it in jumps of 1/3? Or essentially, we're breaking this up. If we were to break up 8/3 into sections of 1/3, how many sections would I have, or how many jumps would I have? Well, let's think about that. If we're trying to take jumps of 1/3, we're going to have to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 jumps. So we could view this as-- let me do this in a different color. I'll do it in this orange. So we took these 8 jumps right over here."
Math,"So we could view 8/3 divided by 1/3 as being equal to 8. Now, why does this actually make sense? Well, when you're dividing things into thirds, for every whole, you're now going to have 3 jumps. So whatever value you're trying to get to, you're going to have that number times 3 jumps. So another way of thinking about it is that 8/3 divided by 1/3 is the same thing as 8/3 times 3. And we could either write it like this. We could write times 3 like that."
Math,"Or, if we want to write 3 as a fraction, we know that 3 is the same thing as 3/1. And we already know how to multiply fractions. Multiply the numerators. 8 times 3. So you have 8-- let me do that that same color. You have 8 times 3 in the numerator now, 8 times 3. And then you have 3 times 1 in the denominator. Which would give you 24/3, which is the same thing as 24 divided by 3, which once again is equal to 8. Now let's see if this still makes sense."
Math,"Instead of dividing by 1/3, if we were to divide by 2/3. So let's think about what 8/3 divided by 2/3 is. Well, once again, this is like asking the question, if we wanted to break up this section from 0 to 8/3 into sections of 2/3, or jumps of 2/3, how many sections, or how many jumps, would I have to make? Well, think about it. 1 jump-- we'll do this in a different color. We could make 1 jump. No, that's the same color as my 8/3. We could do 1 jump. My computer is doing something strange."
Math,"We could do 1 jump, 2 jumps, 3 jumps, and 4 jumps. So we see 8/3 divided by 2/3 is equal to 4. Now, does this make sense in this world right over here? Well, if we take 8/3 and we do the same thing, saying hey, look, dividing by a fraction is the same thing as multiplying by a reciprocal. Well, let's multiply by 3/2. Let's multiply by the reciprocal of 2/3. So we swap the numerator and the denominator. So we multiply it times 3/2."
Math,"And then what do we get? In the numerator, once again, we get 8 times 3, which is 24. And in the denominator, we get 3 times 2, which is 6. So now we get 24 divided by 6 is equal to 4. Now, does it make sense that we got half the answer? If you think about the difference between what we did here and what we did here, these are almost the same, except here we really just didn't divide. Or you could say you divided by 1, while here you divided by 2. Well, does that make sense? Well, sure."
Math,"Because here you jumped twice as far. So you had to take half the number of steps. And so in the first example, you saw why it makes sense to multiply by 3. When you divide by a fraction, for every whole, you're making 3 jumps. So that's why when you divide by this fraction, or whatever is in the denominator, you multiply by it. And now when the numerator is greater than 1, every jump you're going twice as far as you did in this first one right over here. And so you would have to do half as many jumps."
Math,Hopefully that makes sense. It's easy to think about just mechanically how to divide fractions. Taking 8/3 divided by 1/3 is the same thing as 8/3 times 3/1. Or 8/3 divided by 2/3 is the same thing as 8/3 times 3/2. But hopefully this video gives you a little bit more of an intuition of why this is the case..
Math,"This is just going to be equal to the product of the numerators. So 2 times 3 over the product of the denominators, over 5 times 7-- I'm trying to keep the colors consistent-- which of course is going to be equal to 2 times 3 is equal to 6. And 5 times 7-- I'll do this in a new color, let's see, I haven't used this shade of blue yet-- 5 times 7 of course is equal to 35. So this is equal to 6/35.."
Math,"So this thing right here is the same thing as 3/5 times-- so this is our 3/5 right here, and instead of a division sign, you want a multiplication sign, and instead of a 1/2, you want to take the reciprocal of 1/2, which would be 2/1-- so times 2/1. So dividing by 1/2 is the exact same thing as multiplying by 2/1. And we just do this as a straightforward multiplication problem now. 3 times 2 is 6, so our new numerator is 6. 5 times 1 is 5. So 3/5 divided by 1/2 as an improper fraction is 6/5."
Math,"Now, they want us to write it as at mixed number. So we divide the 5 into the 6, figure out how many times it goes. That'll be the whole number part of the mixed number. And then whatever's left over will be the remaining numerator over 5. So what we'll do is take 5 into 6. 5 goes into 6 one time. 1 times 5 is 5. Subtract. You have a remainder of 1. So 6/5 is equal to one whole, or 5/5, and 1/5. This 1 comes from whatever is left over. And now we're done! 3/5 divided by 1/2 is 1 and 1/5."
Math,"Now, the one thing that's not obvious is why did this work? Why is dividing by 1/2 the same thing as multiplying essentially by 2. 2/1 is the same thing as 2. And to do that, I'll do a little side-- fairly simple-- example, but hopefully, it gets the point across. Let me take four objects. So we have four objects: one, two, three, four. So I have four objects, and if I were to divide into groups of two, so I want to divide it into groups of two."
Math,"So that is one group of two and then that is another group of two, how many groups do I have? Well, 4 divided by 2, I have two groups of two, so that is equal to 2. Now, what if I took those same four objects: one, two, three, four. So I'm taking those same four objects. Instead of dividing them into groups of two, I want to divide them into groups of 1/2, which means each group will have half of an object in it. So let's say that would be one group right there. That is a second group."
Math,"That is a third group. I think you see each group has half of a circle in it. That is the fourth. That's the fifth. That's the sixth. That's the seventh, and then that's the eighth. You have eight groups of 1/2, so this is equal to 8. And notice, now each of the objects became two groups. So you could say how many groups do you have? Well, you have four objects and each of them became two groups. I'm looking for a different color. Each of them became two groups, and so you also have eight."
Math,"So dividing by 1/2 is the same thing as multiplying by 2. And you could think about it with other numbers, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit of an intuition.."
Math,"But one thing I think about is, well, if I took 24 1/4, and if I were to divide it into chunks of 3/4 of an hour because this is in hours, how many chunks would I have? So this could represent, let's say that he spent, he spent 45 minutes, which is the same thing of 3/4 of an hour, 3/4 hours, of an hour, I should say, 3/4 of an hour each day. How many days, how many days did it take him, did it take? And then you could evaluate this, 24 1/4 divided by 3/4."
Math,"We've talked about how to evaluate that in other videos. So that's one context. Another one could be some type of a comparison. So let's say that 24 1/4 is 3/4 of the amount of time that he spent doing something else. So let's say, so this is now a completely different context. I'm gonna put a line here. I'll do it in a different color just to make it clear it's a different context."
Math,"So another one could be to justify doing this division, he spent 3/4 as long writing, writing as he spent illustrating, illustrating the chapter. And so then the question is how long did he spend illustrating? How long did he spend illustrating? Now, I really want you to think about this one. My brain, actually, this one takes a little bit longer for my brain to process."
Math,"But when you think about it, if you divide by a fraction that is less than one, you're gonna get a number larger than the one that you're dealing with. Or another way to think about it, the time spent illustrating, time illustrating, I'll write it like this, the time illustrating times 3/4 should be equal to the time spent writing because it says he spent, or he spent, I forgot to write that, he spent 3/4 as long writing as he spent illustrating."
Math,"So time illustrating times 3/4 should be time writing or 24 1/4. So if something times 3/4 is equal to 24 1/4, then 24 1/4 divided by 3/4 should be equal to time illustrating. So these are the two contexts that I can think of that might make sense, but you might be able to think of others.."
Math,"Now, when we divide by a fraction, we just have to remember that that is the same thing, that is completely equivalent to multiplying times the reciprocal of the fraction. So if we have 4/5 here, that'll be 5/4, the reciprocal. Now, you still might say, hey, I have a whole number here and a fraction, and you just have to remember any whole number can be written as a fraction. This is the same thing as 48/1 times 5/4."
Math,"Now, we could just multiply it out at this point and figure out what 48 times 5 is and that'll be over 4, but that'll get big numbers and it'll be hard to kind of divide and all that, but we could divide at this stage right here. We could divide the numerator and the denominator by 4. Or we could say, look, this is going to be equal to 48 times 5, whatever that is, over 4. Now, let's divide the numerator by 4."
Math,"Well, we could divide 48 by 4, and we will get to 12, and whatever we did to the numerator, we have to do to the denominator, so if we divide 4 by 4, we get 1. So then we're left with 12 times 5, which is equal to 60. 12 times 5, which is equal to 60/1, which is the exact same thing as 60. So you can actually make 60 children's or babies' T-shirts from 48 yards if each of them use 4/5 of a yard.."
Math,"So another way of thinking about it is length would be the same thing as area divided by width. So we're trying to figure out the length here. We have the area, we have the width. So our length is going to be 1 and 2/25, 1 and 2/25 divided by 3/5. Now this is going to be the same thing as, let me write this as an improper fraction, it's gonna be easier to do some arithmetic with it. So one is the same thing as 25/25, plus 2/25, this is 27/25 divided by 3/5."
Math,"And we've already talked about how this is saying how many 3/5 can fit into 27/25. And we've given the intuition why this is the same thing as just multiplying 27/25 times the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3. And so this is going to be equal to, and actually I'm gonna factor this out a little bit to simplify things a bit. 27 is 3 x 3 x 3. 25 is 5 x 5. So this is going to be equal to, in our numerator we're gonna have 3 x 3 x 3 x 5. 3 x 3 x 3 x 5. And then in our denominator we're gonna have 5 x 5 x 3."
Math,"5 x 5 x 3. And then we can reduce this a little bit. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by five. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by three. So in the numerator, we're gonna 3 x 3, which is 9/5. So this is all going to be equal to 9/5. So the yoga mat is 3/5 of a meter wide and 9/5 of a meter long. Now let's make sure that this makes sense. So I'm gonna make a grid. So this right over here is 1/5 of a meter."
Math,"1/5 of a meter in that dimension and 1/5 of a meter in that dimension. And then we can see, well, if this is 1/5 of a meter, then the width right over here is 3/5 of a meter. Our length right over here, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, fifths. It is 9/5. Now each of these units, what is its area? Well, it is 1/25 meter squared."
Math,"And how many of these do we have? Well, we can see, we have three rows of nine, which is 27 of these 25ths, so we're gonna have 27/25 square meters, which is the same thing as 1 and 2/5 square meters.."
Math,"I'll write it like this-- 0.6. We want to figure out what this is equal to. And I encourage you to pause the video and try to figure it out on your own. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint. 0.6 is the same thing as 6 divided by 10. We know that if we start with 6, which we could write as 6.0, and if you were to divide it by 10, dividing by 10 is equivalent to moving the decimal place one place to the left. So 6 divided by 10 is 0.6. We are moving the decimal one place to the left."
Math,"So I'm assuming you given a go at it. But what I'm going to do is use this that we already know to rewrite what we're trying to multiply. So 9 times 0.6 is the same thing is 9 times-- 0.6 is 6 divided by 10. And this expression right over here, we could either do the 6 divided by 10 first, in which case we would get 0.6, and this would turn into this problem. Or we could do the 9 times 6 first. And so let's do 9 times 6, which we know how to calculate, and then divide by 10, which we also know how to do."
Math,"all about just moving the decimal place. So we could write 9 times 6. 9 times 6, we already know, is 54. I'll do that in orange-- is going to be 54. So this right over here is 54. And now to get to this expression, we have to divide by 10. We have to divide by 10. And what happens when we divide something by 10? And we've seen this in previous videos, why this is the case. This is all about what decimal notation means."
Math,"Each place represents 10 times as much as the place to its right, or each place represents 1/10 of the place to the left. So 54 divided by 10, this is going to be-- you could start with 54. And I'll put a 0 here after the decimal. And when you divide by 10, that's equivalent of shifting the decimal one to the left. This is going to be equal to 5.4. And that should make sense to you. 5 times 10 is 50. 0.4 times 10 is 4. So it makes sense that 54 divided by 10-- I shouldn't say equal."
Math,"I'd write 54 divided by 10 is equal to 5.4. So this right over here is equal to 5.4, and that's what this is. This is equal to 5.4. Notice, 9 times 6 is 54. 9 times 0.6 is 5.4. Now you might see a little pattern here. Between these two numbers, I had exactly one number to the right of the decimal. When I take its product, let's say I ignored the decimal. I just said 9 times 6, I would've gotten 54."
Math,"But then I have to divide by 10 in order to take account of the decimal, take account of the fact this wasn't a 6. This was a 6/10. And so I have one number to the right of the decimal here. And I want to you to think about that whether that's a general principle. Can we just count the total numbers of digits to the right of the decimals and then our product is going to have the same number of digits to right of the decimal? I'll let you to think about that.."
Math,"This right over here, 7.5 times 0.061. Pause this video and see if you can have a go at it. All right, now let's do this together. So the first thing that you might realize is that 7.5 is the same thing as 75 divided by 10. And 0.061, this is 61 thousandths. This right over here is the same thing as 61 divided by 1,000 and we're gonna take the product of these two things."
Math,"Another way we could write this, 75 divided by 10, this is the same thing as 75 over 10 and I'm gonna take the product of that, and 61 thousandths, 61 divided by 1,000. So that would be 61/1,000. Now, when we look at it, either of these ways, well actually, I'll do both of them at the same time. You could change the order of the multiplication and the division here. So you could start with 75 times 61, 75 times 61, and then divide that by 10, and then divide that by 1,000."
Math,"You could do it that way or you could look right over here and say, all right, if I'm taking this product, my numerator is going to be 75 times 61, 75 times 61. And then, my denominator is going to be 10 times 1,000 which is essentially the same thing as dividing by 10, and then dividing by 1,000. And of course, that is going to be 10,000. Now on the left-hand side, right over here, they told us what this is, it's 4,575. So it's 4,575 divided by 10, and then divided by 1,000."
Math,"Well, if I divide by 10, and then I divide by 1,000, that's equivalent to dividing by 10,000. This is dividing by 10,000 and you could see that over here. We're dividing by 10,000 as well right over here. And the 75 times 61, this is 4,575. Now they want us to evaluate it as a decimal. We've now expressed it as a fraction and I still haven't fully evaluated this yet. So we really wanna think about this as 4,575 ten thousandths and you can see that very explicitly here. There's 4,575 ten thousandths."
Math,"So how do we write that? Well, if I have a decimal right over here, that's the tenths place. This is the hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths place. So we have this many ten thousandths, 4,575 ten thousandths and we're done. So this is gonna be 0.4575. Now I know what some of you might be thinking."
Math,"Hey, I learned a technique where if I'm taking the product of two numbers, I could take the product of those two numbers, or if I'm taking the product of two numbers that are decimals, I could remove the decimals from them essentially, take their product which they actually gave us right over here. And then, count how many digits to the right of the decimal there were in our original numbers. So we have one, two, three, four digits to the right of the decimal."
Math,"And so what I do is I then move, I then make sure that there's four digits to the right of the decimal in the product. And so I would say, okay, one, two, three, four, that looks good and I've gotten the same answer a lot faster than we just did it. Well, whole reason why I just did it the way I did is to show you why that works."
Math,"When we take the product of the two numbers without the decimals, we're essentially ignoring the fact that the original product was dividing by 10 and dividing by 1,000, and that's because we had one digit behind to the right of the decimal here, and we had three digits to the right of the decimal there. And so later after we take the product, we have to go and then actually take that product and divide by 10, and divide by 1,000 or divide by 10,000."
Math,"So that's why you can then just say, all right, well now, we originally had four digits to the right, so we still have to have four digits to the right of the decimal point.."
Math,"And I encourage you to pause this video and try it on your own. So let's just think about a very similar problem but one where essentially we don't write the decimals. Let's just think about multiplying 121 times 43, which we know how to do. So let's just think about this problem first as kind of a simplification, and then we'll think about how to get from this product to this product. So we can start with-- so we're going to say 3 times 1 is 3. 3 times 2 is 6. 3 times 1 is 3. 3 times 121 is 363."
Math,"And now we're going to go to the tens place, so this is a 40 right over here. So since we're in the tens place, let's put a 0 there. 40 times 1 is 40. 40 times 20 is 800. 40 times 100 is 4,000. And we've already known how to do this in the past, and now we can just add all of this together. And we get-- let me do a new color here-- 3 plus 0 is 3. 6 plus 4 is 10. 1 plus 3 plus 8 is 12. 1 plus 4 is 5. So 121 times 43 is 5,203."
Math,"Now, how is this useful for figuring out this product? Well, to go from 1.21 to 121, we're essentially multiplying by 100. Right? We're moving the decimal two places over to the right. And to go from 0.043 to 43, what are we doing? We're removing the decimal, so we're multiplying by ten, hundred, thousand. We're multiplying by 1,000. So to go from this product to this product or to this product, we essentially multiplied by 100, and we multiplied by 1,000."
Math,"So then to go back to this product, we have to divide. We should divide by 100 and then divide by 1,000, which is equivalent to dividing by 100,000. But let's do that. So let's rewrite this number here, so 5,203. Actually let me write it like this just so it's a little bit more aligned, 5,203. And we could imagine a decimal point right over here. If we divide by 100-- so you divide by 10, divide by 100-- and then we want to divide by another 1,000. So divide by 10, divide by 100, divide by 1,000."
Math,"So our decimal point is going to go right over there, and we're done. 1.21 times 0.043 is 0.05203. So one way you could think about it is just multiply these two numbers as if there were no decimals there. Then you could count how many digits are to the right of the decimal, and you see that there are one, two, three, four, five digits to the right of the decimal, and so in your product, you should have one, two, three, four, five digits to the right of the decimal."
Math,"Why is that the case? Well, when you ignored the decimals, when you just pretended that this was 121 times 43, you essentially multiplied this times 100,000-- by 100 and 1,000-- and so to get from the product you get without the decimals to the one that you need with the decimals, you have to then divide by 100,000 again."
Math,"Multiplied by 100,000 is essentially equivalent to moving the decimal place five places to the right, and then dividing by 100,000 is equivalent to the moving the decimal five digits to the left. So divide by 10, divide by 100, divide by 1,000, divide by 10,000, divide by 100,000. And either way, we are done. This is what we get.."
Math,"How many times does 42 go into 71? Well, it goes into 71 one time. Just a reminder, whoever's doing the process where you say, hey, 42 goes into 71 one time. But what we're really saying, 42 goes into 7,100 100 times because we're putting this one in the hundreds place. But let's put that on the side for a little bit and focus on the process. So 1 times 42 is 42, and now we subtract. Now, you might be able to do 71 minus 42 in your head, knowing, hey, 72 minus 42 would be 30."
Math,"So 71 minus 42 would be 29, but we could also do it by regrouping. To regroup, you want to subtract a 2 from a 1. You can't really do that in any traditional way. So let's take a 10 from the 70, so that it becomes a 60, and give that 10 to the ones place, and then that becomes an 11. And so 11 minus 2 is 9, and 6 minus 4 is 2. So you get 29. And we can bring down the next place value. Bring down an 8. And now, this is where the art happens when we're dividing by a multi-digit number right over here."
Math,"We have to estimate how many times does 42 go into 298. And sometimes it might involve a little bit of trial and error. So you really just kind of have to eyeball it. If you make a mistake, try again. The way you know you make a mistake is, if say it goes into it 9 times, and you do 9 times 42 and you get a number larger than 298, then you overestimated. If you say it goes into it three times, you do 3 times 42, you get some number here."
Math,"When you subtract, you get something larger than 42, then you also made a mistake, and you have to adjust upwards. Well, let's see if we can eyeball it. So this is roughly 40. This is roughly 300. 40 goes into 300 the same times as 4 goes into the 30, so it's going to be roughly 7. Let's see if that's right. 7 times 2 is 14. 7 times 1 is 28, plus 1 is 29. So I got pretty close. My remainder here-- notice 294 is less than 298. So I'm cool there. And my remainder is less than 42, so I'm cool as well."
Math,"So now let's add another place value. Let's bring this 2 down. And here we're just asking ourselves, how many times does 42 go into 42? Well, 42 goes into 42 exactly one time. 1 times 42 is 42, and we have no remainder. So this one luckily divided exactly. 42 goes into 7,182 exactly 171 times.."
Math,"It goes into 63 one time, because 2 times 35 is 70, so that's too big. So it goes one time. So let me write that. 1 times 35 is 35. And then if we were to subtract and we can regroup up here, we can take a 10 from the 60, so it becomes a 50, give that 10 to the 3, so it becomes a 13. 13 minus 5 is 8. 5 minus 3 is 2. So you could just say, hey, 63 divided by 35-- let me write this. You could say 63 divided by 35 is equal to 1 remainder 28. But this isn't so satisfying."
Math,"We know that the real answer is going to be one point something, something, something. So what I want to do is keep dividing. I want to divide this thing completely and see what type of a decimal I actually get. And to do that, I essentially have to add a decimal here and then just keep bringing down decimal places to the right of the decimal. So 63 is the exact same thing as 63.0, and I could add as many zeroes as I might want to add here."
Math,"So what we could do is we just make sure that this decimals right over there, and we can now bring down a zero from the tenths place right over here. And you bring down that zero, and now we ask ourselves, how many times does 35 go into 280? And, as always, this is a bit of an art when you're dividing a two-digit number into a three-digit number. So let's see, it's definitely going to be-- if I were to say-- so 40 goes into 280 seven times. 30 goes into 280 about nine times."
Math,"It's going to be between 7 and 9, so let's try 8. So, let's see what 35 times 8 is. 35 times 8. 5 times 8 is 40, 3 times 8 is 24, plus 4 is 28. So it actually works out perfectly. So 35 goes into 280 exactly eight times. 8 times 5, we already figured it out. 8 times 35 is exactly 280, and we don't have any remainder now, so we don't have to bring down any more of these zeroes. So now we know exactly that 63 divided by 35 is equal to exactly 1.8.."
Math,"And the key here is to keep track of the decimal. But other than that, you're really treating it like a traditional long division problem. So you want to put the decimal, it's to the right of the ones place. So it's right over there. I just put the decimal right above the decimal. And now we would treat it just like a traditional long division problem. So how many times does 7 go into 5? Well, it goes into 5 zero times, and we could write 0 times 7 is 0."
Math,"Actually, let's do that, just to show that it works to kind of do the process all the way through. 0 times 7 is 0. You subtract, you get 5. So you get this 5 right over here. So you get 5, and then we can bring down another 0. We bring down this 0 right over here. So now we ask ourselves, how many times does 7 go into 50? Well, 7 times 7 is 49, so it's going to go seven times. 7 times 7, 49. Subtract, you get 1. And now we can bring down this 0. Let's do that. We bring down that 0. 7 goes into 10 one time."
Math,"1 times 7 is 7. Subtract, get a 3. And now finally, we can bring down this 5. We can bring down the 5. And we ask ourselves, how many times does 7 go into 35? Well, 5 times 7 is 35. This goes 5 times. 5 times 7 is 35. Subtract, and we are done. We have divided it completely. And so 5.005 divided by 7 is equal to 0.715.."
Math,"So we could also write this as 518 divided-- let me write a little bit bigger than that, since we have to do some work with it. 518 divided by-- I'll do the division sign in white-- divided by 0.7. So the first thing we do, since we have this decimal here, we're dividing by a decimal. So try to turn this into a whole number somehow. Well, the best way to turn this into a whole number is to multiply this by 10, which is essentially multiplying, shifting the decimal point over to the right."
Math,"So this would become a 7. But we can't just do that only for what we're dividing by. We also have to do that to the 518, so that a value does not change. So we need to multiply both of these times 10. So if we move the decimal over to the right with the 0.7 to turn into a 7, we also need to move the decimal over to the right for 518. Now, you're probably saying, well, I don't see a decimal in 518. Well, there is one."
Math,"You just didn't have to write it, because it's 518.00-- and we can add as many zeroes as we want. So if we move the decimal to the right, it becomes 5,180. So really what we're saying is 518 divided by 0.7 is the same thing as 5,180 divided by 7. Notice all we did by moving the decimal one place to the right, is we multiplied both of these numbers by 10, which is not going to change the actual value of the decimal."
Math,"One other way of thinking about this, if you wanted to write this as a fraction, this is the same thing as 518 over 0.7. You multiply both the numerator and denominator by 10, you will get 5,180 over 7. So let's clean this up a little bit, just so we remember what we did. So we moved the decimal over to the right, one. So now this is just a 7. The decimal is there. In fact, we really don't have to write the decimal anymore. It's just a 7.0-- you could imagine 7.0, so we can just write this as a 7."
Math,"And then the 518, the decimal is now out here. So this is 5,180. And let's increase the sign right over here. Now, this is just a straight-up long division problem. How many times does 7 go into 5? Well, it goes 0 times. 0 times 7-- actually, let's just cut to the chase. 7 doesn't go into 5. It does go into 51. 7 times 7 is 49. So it goes 7 times. 7 times 7 is 49. Subtract 51 minus 49 is 2. And now we can bring down this 8. 7 goes into 28 four times. 4 times 7 is 28. Subtract, you get a 0."
Math,"Now we can bring down another 0. We want at least get to the decimal place. So we bring down another 0 right over here. When I say get to the decimal place, we could put the decimal place up here too, just to make sure we're keeping track of the right place values or that we can have the decimal in the right place. So notice, I'm very particular. When I'm doing 7 goes into 51, I put the 7 right above the 1 in the 51's place."
Math,"When I'm saying 7 goes into 28, I'm putting the 4 right above the 8 in this one's place when we're doing the division. So now we say how many times does 7 go into 0? Well, it goes 0 times. 0 times 7 is 0. Subtract, you have no remainder. So we could keep going, and we'll just keep getting zeroes like this. But we see that this is equal to 740.."
Math,"And when I look at something like this, the first thing that I think about is well, is there a way that I can rewrite this? Instead of dividing it by 25 hundredths, instead of dividing it by 0.25, I could divide it by a whole number, maybe 25. And so how do I turn 25 hundredths into 25? Well, if I multiply it by, if I multiply it by 10 once, then. the decimal's one spot to the right. And if I multiply it by 10 twice, then I'm gonna move two spots to the right. And 25 hundredths is going to become 25."
Math,"I multiplied by 10 twice, which is the same thing as multiplying by a hundred. Now of course, I can't only do it to 0.25, that would change the value of this entire expression. I also have to do it to 6.3. If I move the decimal to the right twice over here, to get a whole number, I gotta move the decimal twice to the right over here. So let's see, if I move it to the right once, I get 63, so that's one multiplication by 10."
Math,"And now I wanna move it to the right again, and you might say, ""Wait, wait, there doesn't look like ""there's any other digits here ""that I can move to the right of."" And we just have to remind ourselves, that 6.3, well that's going to be the same thing as 6.30, or we could actually as many zeroes as we want to the end of this, and not change the value, it's still 6.3. Six and three tenths is the same thing as six and 30 hundredths. So now, I can move the decimal one more spot to the right."
Math,"And, so I'm multiplying by 10 again. And it becomes 630. So 6.3 divided by 0.25 is the same thing as 630 divided by 25. And let me do that again, because this is really, the tricky part, or the artful part, when you're dividing decimals. If I were to write, 0.25, being divided into, being divided into, Six, let me do it. Six, 6.3. Now, what I care about is moving this decimal to the right, far enough so that this becomes a whole number."
Math,"I don't have to move it any further, just far enough so that this becomes a whole number. And then I have to move this, the same number of times to the right. But the goal is to make this a whole number, not to make the 6.3 a whole number, although that is going to happen for this particular case. So if I move it two spaces to the right, so, one, two. 0.25 becomes 25, and then 6.3 becomes, move it one space, two spaces to the right, it becomes 630."
Math,"And so let me, let me clarify that, let me just clear all of this stuff away out of the way, to just make that clear what I just did. So we don't have to deal with all of this messiness when we're actually doing our long division now. And so this one over here, let me erase all of this business. And we are ready to do some, we're ready to do some, some long division, alright. So now this is just straightforward, dividing a two digit number into a three digit number."
Math,"And so we could say, well, 25 goes into six zero times, so let's keep going. 25 goes into 63, let's see, two times 25 is 50, three times 25 is 75, so that's too much, so we wanna go two times. Two times 25 is going to be 50, and we can subtract. Or, if you didn't know two times 25 is going to 50, you could have said two times five is 10, carry the one or regroup the one. Two times two is four, plus one is five. So we got 50. And now we subtract, and we get three minus zero is three, six minus five is one."
Math,"And now we bring down the next digit. We can bring down this zero. And we could say, 25, and let me scratch this out, so I don't confuse myself later. 25 goes into 130 how many times? Let's see, 25 times four is 100, 25 times five is 125, 25 times six would be 150, so that's too big. So I'm gonna go five times."
Math,"So five times, And I write, it's very important to keep track of my places right here, I brought down the zero to make the 13 into 130, so I say 25 goes into 130 five times, I write it above the zero, I write it right above the zero right over there. And then five times 25, five times five, we already know what it is, but I'll just figure it out. Five times five is 25, regroup the two, five times two is 10, plus two is 12. And now we can, now we can subtract."
Math,"And you might know offhand, well (mumbles), 130 minus 125 is going to be five, or if you like, you could do a little regrouping, can make this, you could take a 10 from there, and then put the 10 in the ones place, and this becomes 10, 10 minus five is five. Now, we aren't done yet. We wanna divide this completely, so we can bring down another zero. We can bring down another zero, and I'm picking an appropriate color, to, for the next, so I'll use, well I already used the green once, we'll use yellow."
Math,"So once again, I can bring down another zero, but I have to be very careful here, I can't just, I can't just throw a zero right over there. That's gonna turn 630 into 6300. I have to be very particular, say no, look, look. This next zero I'm gonna put, that's gonna be after the decimal. Now 630 is the same thing as 630.0, and if I'm gonna add a decimal there, I wanna throw the decimal right above it. Need to be very careful with that. But now we're ready to start bringing down the zero."
Math,"So let's bring down this zero. And we have 50, how many times does 25 go into 50? Let me scratch this out, so we don't confuse ourselves later. 25 goes two times into 50, two times 25 is in fact 50, is in fact 50. And so now we can subtract. And we now have a remainder of zero, and there's nothing left to bring down other than zeros, and we have a remainder of zero, so we are done dividing completely. You take 630, divided by 25, it's 25.2."
Math,"Or if you look at our original problem, if you look at our original problem, which was 6.30 divided by 0.25, that also is 25.2. So this is also going to be 25.2. Let me rewrite it, let me rewrite it. So our original problem was 6.3 divided by 0.25, which we just figured out, what we just figured out is 25.2. And we're done.."
Math,"So the first thing I like to do is, I don't like to divide by a decimal. So I'm going to multiply 6.7, I'm going to multiply 6.7 by 10, which is essentially just taking this decimal and moving it one space to the right. Well I can't just do that to the 6.7, I also have to do that to the 2.21. So let me move its decimal one space to the right. And so now I can rewrite the problem. I can rewrite it as 22 point, divided by, divided by, instead of writing it as 6.7 I can now write it as 67."
Math,"67, let me do it in that same color. I can now write it as 67. I could write a decimal right over here but that's not going to change the fact that this is just now the whole number 67. And so now I'm ready to do some long division now that I'm dividing by a whole number. You might say, ""Wait, I still have a decimal over here,"" but that's okay and you're going to see that in a second. So let's try to do some long division."
Math,"So we're going to take, we're going to take 22.11 or 22 and 11 hundredths, and we are going to divide, let me write that a little bit bigger just so we have some space. 22.11, and we are going to divide that by... We are going to divide that by 67. Alright, let's do some long division now. And actually, before we even do that, I like to keep track of my decimal. So my decimal is over here, I'm going to write my decimal right over here in the answer."
Math,"And when you're doing these long division problems it's really important to write things neatly and keep things in nice columns and keep track of your place value because if you don't write things in neat columns then frankly you'll probably lose track of your place value. But let's do this. So 67 goes into 2 zero times, so let's move on. 67 goes into 22 zero times. 67 goes into 221. So let's think about that a little bit. This is pretty close to 70, 70 times 3 would be 210."
Math,"So this looks like maybe three times, three times seems about right. So let's try, let's put a 3 up here. 3 times 7 is 21, carry the 2, 3 times 6 is 18, plus 2 is 20, is 20. So we get 201 and the difference between 221 and 201 is going to be... Well you just get a 0 here, you get a 2 here, then you get a 0 here, I don't have to write it. It's 20. So 3 was right, if 3 times 67 were higher than 221 then we'd be in trouble."
Math,"And then if 3 times 67 were lower but it was so low that when you subtracted you got a number higher than 67 then that means you could have thrown in more 67s in there, but this number's just right. It's lower but our remainder is less than, is less than 67, so let's keep going. So now we can bring down, we can bring down the 1 and we see 67 goes into 201, well we just figured that out. 67 goes into 201 three times, three times. 3 times 7 is one, carry the 2, gotta make sure we don't..."
Math,"Well, if we're doing the same problem as we did before but it's good to not have the previous 2 there, sometimes you might want to erase it. Then you have 3 times 6 is 18 plus 2 is 20. And now you subtract, and we are done because we have no remainder and there's nothing here left to bring down. And so 22.11 divided by 67 is... And we can throw a 0 here just for good measure. It's 0.33. 0.33, this is equal to 0.33. Or this is equal to 0.33. And we're done.."
Math,"Now the first thing you want to do when your divisor, the number that you're dividing into the other number, is a decimal, is to multiply it by 10 enough times so that it becomes a whole number so you can shift the decimal to the right. So every time you multiply something by 10, you're shifting the decimal over to the right once. So in this case, we want to switch it over the right once and twice. So 0.25 times 10 twice is the same thing as 0.25 times 100, and we'll turn the 0.25 into 25."
Math,"Now if you do that with the divisor, you also have to do that with the dividend, the number that you're dividing into. So we also have to multiply this by 10 twice, or another way of doing it is shift the decimal over to the right twice. So we shift it over once, twice. It will sit right over here. And to see why that makes sense, you just have to realize that this expression right here, this division problem, is the exact same thing as having 1.03075 divided by 0.25."
Math,"And so we're multiplying the 0.25 by 10 twice. We're essentially multiplying it by 100. Let me do that in a different color. We're multiplying it by 100 in the denominator. This is the divisor. We're multiplying it by 100, so we also have to do the same thing to the numerator, if we don't want to change this expression, if we don't want to change the number. So we also have to multiply that by 100. And when you do that, this becomes 25, and this becomes 103.075. Now let me just rewrite this."
Math,"Sometimes if you're doing this in a workbook or something, you don't have to rewrite it as long as you remember where the decimal is. But I'm going to rewrite it, just so it's a little bit neater. So we multiplied both the divisor and the dividend by 100. This problem becomes 25 divided into 103.075. These are going to result in the exact same quotient. They're the exact same fraction, if you want to view it that way."
Math,"We've just multiplied both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to shift the decimal over to the right twice. Now that we've done that, we're ready to divide. So the first thing, we have 25 here, and there's always a little bit of an art to dividing something by a multiple-digit number, so we'll see how well we can do. So 25 does not go into 1. 25 does not go into 10. 25 does go into 103. We know that 4 times 25 is 100, so 25 goes into 100 four times. 4 times 5 is 20. 4 times 2 is 8, plus 2 is 100."
Math,"We knew that. Four quarters is $1.00. It's 100 cents. And now we subtract. 103 minus 100 is going to be 3, and now we can bring down this 0. So we bring down that 0 there. 25 goes into 30 one time. And if we want, we could immediately put this decimal here. We don't have to wait until the end of the problem. This decimal sits right in that place, so we could always have that decimal sitting right there in our quotient or in our answer. So we were at 25 goes into 30 one time."
Math,"1 times 25 is 25, and then we can subtract. 30 minus 25, well, that's just 5. I mean, we can do all this borrowing business, or regrouping. This can become a 10. This becomes a 2. 10 minus 5 is 5. 2 minus 2 is nothing. But anyway, 30 minus 25 is 5. Now we can bring down this 7. 25 goes into 57 two times, right? 25 times 2 is 50. 25 goes into 57 two times. 2 times 25 is 50. And now we subtract again. 57 minus 50 is 7. And now we're almost done. We bring down that 5 right over there."
Math,"25 goes into 75 three times. 3 times 25 is 75. 3 times 5 is 15. Regroup the 1. We can ignore that. That was from before. 3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7. So you can see that. And then we subtract, and then we have no remainder. So 25 goes into 103.075 exactly 4.123 times, which makes sense, because 25 goes into 100 about four times. This is a little bit larger than 100, so it's going to be a little bit more than four times."
Math,"And that's going to be the exact same answer as the number of times that 0.25 goes into 1.03075. This will also be 4.123. So this fraction, or this expression, is the exact same thing as 4.123. And we're done!."
Math,"Well, what's that saying? That's saying, well, every hour, how many miles are you going if you were to stay at that current rate. So, it could be a measure of speed. How much distance are you covering per unit time? And, most typically, when people talk about rates, that's what they're talking about. They're talking about how much of something that is happening per unit time."
Math,"And, it doesn't have to be even distance per unit time, you might have a, you might have your hourly rate for someone who is doing some type of a job. They might say that they're making, they're making $10, so they're making $10. And, actually, let me write the dollars out so the units become a little bit more obvious, 10 dollars, dollars per hour, dollars per, dollars per hour. And so, once again, this is how much money. It's not talking about distance anymore."
Math,"How much money is being earned per unit time? And, so, even though rates are often associated with how much something is happening per some unit time, and it could be miles per hour, or it could be meters per second, or, in this case, it could be a wage, it could be dollars per hour. Rates don't have to be just in those terms."
Math,"In fact, you might say, ""All right, ""I have a dessert that I really enjoy, ""but I'm very conscientious ""about, about the number of calories that I consume."" And, you might, you might see something like, there are 200 calories, calories per serving, per serving. And, so, this is telling us the number of calories per a serving. And they'll tell us what a serving is. A serving might be a cup or eight ounces or whatever else."
Math,"And, so, I could say, ""Okay, look, if I have two servings, ""then I'm gonna have 400 calories. ""Same way, if I work two hours, I'm gonna have 20 dollars. ""If I, or if I go two hours, ""I'm gonna go 70 miles."" So, rates give you a sense. It's like, how fast is something happening? Or how much of one thing is happening for every time something else happens? Now, I can write rates so they look an awful lot like a ratio. And, these words are, actually, very related, 'cause you see that even how they're written."
Math,"R-A-T, R-A-T. Their roots are coming from the exact same idea. In fact, this rate over here, 35 miles per hour, it could come from, ""Hey, I just, I just went 35 miles in one hour, ""what's the ratio?"" So, the ratio of miles to hours. And, then, you could say, ""Well, I went 35, ""the ratio miles to hours ""was 35 to one."" Or it could have been, maybe it was 70 to two or something like that. But, that could have been reduced to 35 to one. So, as a ratio, you would typically see it written like this..."
Math,"Or maybe see it written like, see it written like this... And, sometimes, you might even see it written like this, 35 miles to one hour. But, now it's starting to resemble more of the special case of a ratio, which we call a ""rate."" Because, this is the same thing as 35. Instead of writing it out ""miles per hour,"" you'll often see it written like this, miles per, miles per hour. So, these are very, very related ideas."
Math,"If you find the ratio between calories and servings, well, then, you're going to be able to write, you're going to be able to express it as a rate and vice versa. Now, why do we care about rates? Well, especially if we're thinking about things like speed, without rates, it would be hard to quantify how fast things are happening. Otherwise, we'd be in a world where we're saying, ""Hey, I'm faster than you,"" or ""She's faster than me."" But we wouldn't be able to quantify exactly how fast they are."
Math,"But with rates, we can say, ""Hey, that person ran ""a hundred meters in 10 seconds, ""they run 10 meters per second."" We can quantify exactly how fast that thing is happening, the rate at which it is happening. Here, instead of saying, ""Hey, a cup of that ""is gonna give you, is gonna give you more energy, or, maybe, contribute more to your weight than a cup of that, and making these relative comparisons, here, you can actually, you can actually quantify things."
Math,"And when we study rate, we're gonna study rate a lot in mathematics. It's gonna be essential in algebra when we look at the rate of change of a line, how far it moves in the vertical direction relative to the horizontal direction. We're gonna call that ""slope"". And you can even imagine the slope of a hill as how fast is it climbing for as much as you move forward. But we're also gonna study rates in detail when we go to calculus."
Math,"In fact, the whole basis of differential calculus, that you might see later in high school and early college, is all about measuring instantaneous rate. How fast is something going right now? So, rates are really, really interesting, really, really important. And, I would guess that, if you just look around your life, even over the next few hours, you're going to encounter many, many, many rates.."
Math,"That's what the first sentence told us. But we want to figure out the rate per hour, or the newspapers per hour, so we can really just flip this rate right here. So if we were to just flip it, we would have 189 newspapers for every 3 hours, which is really the same information. We're just flipping what's in the numerator and what's in the denominator. Now we want to write it in as simple as possible form, and let's see if this top number is divisible by 3. 1 plus 8 is 9, plus 9 is 18."
Math,"So that is divisible by 3. So let's divide this numerator and this denominator by 3 to simplify things. So if you divide 189 by 3. Let's do it over on the side right here. 3 goes into 189. 3 goes and 18 six times. 6 times 3 is 18. Subtract. Bring down the 9. 18 minus 18 was nothing. 3 goes into 9 exactly three times. 3 times 3 is 9, no remainder. So if you divide 189 by 3, you get 63, and if you divide 3 by 3, you're going to get 1."
Math,"You have to divide both the numerator and the denominator by the same number. So now we have 63 newspapers for every 1 hour. Or we could write this as 63 over 1 newspapers per hour. Or we could write this as 63, because 63 over 1 is the same thing as 63 newspapers per hour.."
Math,"And there's a couple of ways you can think about it. The ratio here is $75 for every 4 hours. So if you wanted one hour of tutoring, well, it's just going to be 1/4 of the $75, or you could just take 75 and divide by 4. Another way you could think about it, you could say Nierria gets $75 for every 4 hours, which is another way of saying that Nierria is going to earn 75 divided by 4 dollars per hour. So really we just have to figure out what 75 divided by 4 is. So let's do a little bit of long division."
Math,"So 4 goes into 7 one time, 1 times 4 is 4. We're going to subtract. 7 minus 4 is 3. Bring down that 5. 4 goes into 35 eight times. 8 times 4 is 32. I will subtract again. I get a 3. Well now I'm going to get some decimals here, so let me bring down a zero. 4 goes into 30 seven times. 7 times 4 is 28. Subtract, and then I get a 2. Bring down another zero. 4 goes into 20 five times. 5 times 4 is 20, and I am done, no more remainder here."
Math,"So we get that Nierria earns 18.75 dollars, dollars per hour, or you can just say that she makes $18.75 per hour.."
Math,"Based on the crowdedness, in which park would the conservationist expect to see the highest rate of aggression? So pause this video and see if you can figure this out. All right, now let's work through this together. So we wanna order the parks from least crowded to most crowded. So how can we think about crowded? Well, we could think about it in terms of the number of squirrels. Squirrels per area, per hectare."
Math,"And so something with a lot of squirrels per hectare would be more crowded, and something with fewer squirrels per hectare would be less crowded. You could also, if you wanted to, think about it in terms of hectares per squirrel, this would also be a legitimate way of tackling it. And of course, if you have more hectares per squirrel, that would be less crowded. It would be the other way around. While if you had fewer hectares per squirrel, it would be more crowded."
Math,"But here, when we look at this, the numbers of squirrels are larger than the number of hectares in every scenario. So it might be a little bit easier to divide in this one. And this is also how my brain tends to think about it. So let's calculate the number of squirrels per hectare for each of these parks. So, first of all, let's think about park A, and I will do that over here. Park A, you have 54 squirrels. I'll write squ for short, per every eight hectares."
Math,"And so this is going to be the same thing as 54 over eight squirrels per hectare. And we could try to estimate it, but it looks like they're all actually a little bit around seven if we divide the number of squirrels by the number of hectares, so we might have to get a little bit more precise. So let's see, eight goes into 54. I will do it over here. Eight goes into 54, it goes six times, six times eight is 48. And I subtract, I get a remainder of six. And then let me put a little decimal here."
Math,"And then if I bring down that zero, eight goes into 60 seven times, seven times eight is 56. And I can keep going, but let me see if this is enough precision for me to compare. So park A is approximately, I'll make this little squiggle here for approximately, 6.7 squirrels per hectare. Now let me do park B right over here. So for park B, we have 20 squirrels, squ for short, for every 2.7 hectares."
Math,"Now, one thing we can do to help simplify this so we don't have to deal with decimals is let's multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10. Notice that's just equivalent to multiplying by one. So this is equivalent to saying you have 200 squirrels for every 27 hectares, or you could view it as 200 over 27 squirrels per hectare. So let's take 27 into 200, and if I were to estimate it, let's see, 27 is close to 30. 30 would go into 200 six times. Let me try that out."
Math,"So it goes into 200 six times, six times seven is 42, six times two is 12, plus four is 16. And then if I subtract, I am going to actually get, it looks like 38. So maybe I can fit in one more 27 there. So let me do that seven. So seven times seven is 49. 49, seven times two is 14 plus four is 18. Yep, that worked out nicely. If you subtract 189 from 200, you're going to get 11. And now let me bring down a zero. So how many times does 27 go into 110? Well, it looks like it goes three times, I think."
Math,"Three times seven is 21, three times two is six, plus two is eight. And it looks like actually I could fit in one more. So let's see, it might go four times. So 110. So if they go four times, four times seven is 28, and then four times two is eight, plus two is 10. Yeah, it went four times, so get a remainder of two. So we could keep going, but this is approximately 7.4. So approximately 7.4 squirrels per hectare. So we already see that park B is more crowded than park A, but now let's check out park C."
Math,"And so for park C, we have 51 squirrels for every 6.8 hectares, 6.8 hectares. So we could do the same idea. Let's multiply the numerator and the denominator by 10, which means that we have 510 squirrels for every 68 hectares. And so 68 will go into 510. I'm guessing I'm gonna have to have some decimals here. So it's close to 70. 70 would go into 510 about seven times. Let me see how that works out. Seven times eight is 56, seven times six is 42, plus five is 47. And I think I did well there."
Math,"So if I subtract here, I could do some regrouping, or I could try to do it in my head. To go from 476 to 500, I would have to add 24 plus another 10. So I'm gonna have 34 right over here, bring down a zero. And so if I'm thinking roughly 70 goes into 340, let's see, will it go? It might go five times actually. Let me try that out. If I say 7.5, five times eight is 40, and then five times six is 30 plus four, it went exactly five times. So that means in park C, we're at 7.5 squirrels per hectare."
Math,"So what's the most crowded if I wanted to order it? Well, the most crowded is park C, the second crowded is park B, and the third most crowded is park A. And so based on crowdedness, in which park would I expect the highest rate of aggression? Well, park C, those squirrels are all, they're much closer to each other. They might be fighting over things, who knows? But there we go. We answered the question.."
Math,"20% is equal to-- I'm just writing it out as a word-- 20 percent, which literally means 20 per cent. And if you're familiar with the word century, you might already know that cent comes from the Latin for the word hundred. This literally means you can take cent, and that literally means 100. So this is the same thing as 20 per 100. If you want to shade 20%, that means, if you break up the square into 100 pieces, we want to shade 20 of them. 20 per 100."
Math,"So how many squares have they drawn here? So if we go horizontally right here, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten squares. If we go vertically, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. So this is a 10 by 10 square. So it has 100 squares here. Another way to say it is that this larger square-- I guess that's the square that they're talking about. This larger square is a broken up into 100 smaller squares, so it's already broken up into the 100."
Math,"So if we want to shade 20% of that, we need to shade 20 of every 100 squares that it is broken into. So with this, we'll just literally shade in 20 squares. So let me just do one. So if I just do one square, just like that, I have just shaded 1 per 100 of the squares. 100 out of 100 would be the whole. I've shaded one of them. That one square by itself would be 1% of the entire square. If I were to shade another one, if I were to shade that and that, then those two combined, that's 2% of the entire square."
Math,"It's literally 2 per 100, where 100 would be the entire square. If we wanted to do 20, we do one, two, three, four-- if we shade this entire row, that will be 10%, right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And we want to do 20, so that'll be one more row. So I can shade in this whole other row right here. And then I would have shaded in 20 of the 100 squares."
Math,"Or another way of thinking about it, if you take this larger square, divide it into 100 equal pieces, I've shaded in 20 per 100, or 20%, of the entire larger square. Hopefully, that makes sense.."
Math,"If you had 100 per 100, you're dealing with the whole, but now we have more than a whole. We have 109 per 100. We can actually write this as a ratio, or as a fraction. This is the same thing as 109 per 100. It's the the same thing as 109/100. So let's shade that in. So we have a whole here, so we could consider this square a whole. In the last video, we counted. This is a 10 by 10 square. It is cut up into 100 pieces."
Math,"So if we want 109 of those 100 pieces, what are we talking about? That means we're going to shade in all of the 100 right over here. Let me do that in a new color. So we'll shade in all of this. If you just shaded that in, that would be 100%. That would be 100/100, or 100 per 100, or 100%. I think you're getting the meaning of all of this. I don't just want you just memorize this stuff. This really just means 100 out of 100, or a whole. And you can see that this is the whole square."
Math,"That's 100 out of 100 right there. The question is saying show us 109% by shading. We already did 100 per 100, but we need to do another 9, so let's shade in another 9. So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So this piece right here, you could almost view that is-- well, that is! That is 9% of an entire square. This is 100% of an entire square. If you considered this whole thing plus this blue area right over here, you are talking about 109% of one whole square."
Math,"Hopefully, that made sense.."
Math,"The whole is divided into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 equal sections, of which one, two, three, four, five, six, seven are actually filled in. That's the shaded area, so one way to think about it is 7/10 are shaded in, but how do we express this fraction as a percent? They're asking for a percent. Well remember, percent, it literally means per hundred. Cent, same root as the word 100."
Math,"You see it cents or century, and so can we write this as per 100 instead of per 10? Well, seven per 10 is the same thing as 70 per 100, or 70%. And how did I go from 7/10 to 70 over 100? Well, I just multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10. And once you do more and more percents, you'll get a hang of it. You'll say, ""Oh, 7/10. ""That's the same thing as 70 per 100, which is 70%."" Let's do another example."
Math,"Here, we're told 100% is shown on the following tape diagram, so just this amount right over here is 100%, and then they ask us what percent is represented by the entire tape diagram, so by this entire thing right over here. Pause this video and see if you can answer that. Well, one way to think about 100%, 100% is equivalent to a whole, and now we have three times as much as that for the entire tape diagram, so you could view this as three wholes, or you could say that's 100%."
Math,"We have another 100% right over here. And then we have another 100% right over here, so the whole tape diagram, that would be 300%. Let's do another example. This is strangely fun. (laughs) Okay, and I'll see. It says the large rectangle below represents one whole. All right, so that's this whole thing is one whole. What percentage is represented by the shaded area? So pause the video and see if you can figure that out again."
Math,"So let's just express it as a fraction first, so we have a total of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 squares. So out of those 20 squares, we see that six of them are actually shaded in. So 6/20, could we write that as per 100? Well, let's see. To go from 20 to 100, I multiply by five, and so if I multiply the numerator by five, I'll get the same value."
Math,"Six times five is 30, so six per 20 is the same thing as 30 per 100, which is the same thing as 30%, which literally means per 100, so this is 30%. Let's do one last example. Here we are told each large rectangle below represents one whole, so this is a whole, and then this whole thing right over here is another whole. What percentage is represented by the shaded area? Again, pause the video. See if you can answer that."
Math,"So this one, we've shaded in a whole, so that is 100%, and then over here, we have shaded in one, two, three, 4/5 of the whole. So 4/5, if I wanted to express it as per 100, what would it be? Well, five time 20 is 100, so four times 20 is 80, so 4/5, or 80/100, is filled out here. We could say 80 per 100, which is the same thing as 80%, so this right over here is 80%. So what percent is represented by the shaded area? Well, we have 100%, and then we have 80%, so we have 180%. It's more than a whole."
Math,"If you have a percentage that is larger than 100%, you're talking about something that is more than a whole, and then we see that. We have a whole right over here, and then we have 80% more than that.."
Math,"All right, well, I'm going to try to visualize this with what we call a double number line. So let's say that is zero, and 28 is the total number of students in this classroom right over here. As a double number line, because I'm going to make another number line right below it. But I'm going to write these points in terms of percentages. So zero students would be 0% of the students in Omar's class, and 28 students would be 100% of the students in Omar's class."
Math,"And so what we really need to do now is, we know that 21 of them take the bus. 21 is going to be roughly around here. So that's 21. So we really just need to figure out, is what percentage is this going to be? One way to think about it is what fraction is 21 of 28? Well, if I write 21 over 28, we know that we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by seven, they're both divisible by seven, 21 divided by seven is three, and 28 divided by seven is four. So 21 is three-fourths of 28."
Math,"So let's divide this number line from zero to 28 into fourths. So that would be halfway, and now we have it divided into fourths, and we can see that 21 is one, two, three of these fourths. Well, if 21 is three-fourths of the way to 28, then whatever percentage this is here, that would be three-fourths of the way to 100. So let's divide this into fourths as well. Now we know that one-fourth of 100 is 25%. Two-fourths of 100 is 50%. Three-fourths of 100 is 75%."
Math,So what percentage of the students in Omar's class take the bus to school?.
Math,"All right, now let's do it together. And my brain wants to make sure I know the difference between three years ago and today. So today, she can run 170 meters in one minute. And what we want to figure out is how much could she run in one minute three years ago? Well, we know this 170 meters is 125% of the distance that she could do three years ago. And the distance she could do three years ago, of course, is 100% of the distance that she could do three years ago, because it's the exact same distance."
Math,"But I like to think in terms of fractions. So 125%, I could rewrite that as 125 over 100. If I divide both the numerator and the denominator by 25, this is equivalent to five over four. So that 170 meters, that is five-fourths of what she could do three years ago. And what you could do three years ago would be four-fourths of what she could do three years ago, because that's 100%. And so to figure out if five-fourths is 170 meters, what is four-fourths? Let us set up a tape diagram right over here."
Math,"And I'm going to try to hand draw it as best as I can. I want to make five equal sections. And I know it's not exactly, but let's say for the sake of argument for this video, this is five equal sections. And so if we imagine that each of these are a fourth, this is five-fourths. And then this distance right over here is going to be 170 meters. That's what she could run today. And what we want to do is figure out what is four-fourths? That's the distance that she could run in one minute three years ago."
Math,"So this is our question mark. Well to do that, we just have to figure out how big is each of these fourths? And if five of them is 170 meters, well, I just have to divide five into 170. Five goes into 17 three times. Three times five is 15. Subtract, I get a two here, bring down the zero. Five goes into 20 four times. Four times five is 20, and it works out perfectly. So each of these five-fourths are 34 meters. 34 meters, 34 meters, 34 meters, 34 meters, and 34 meters."
Math,"And so the distance that she could run three years ago is going to be four of these fourths, or four of these 34 meters. So 34 times four, four times four is 16, three times four is 12, plus one is 13. So the mystery distance that she could run in one minute three years ago is 136 meters. And we are done.."
Math,"So pause the video and see if you can do that. Well, let's first think about it as a fraction. So, the whole is split into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 equal sections, and six of them are filled in. So the blue represents 6/10 of a whole, or it represents, you could just say, 6/10. And you could also rewrite that. If you divide the numerator and the denominator by two, that's the same thing as three over five. Fair enough. Now let's represent it as a decimal."
Math,"What decimal would it be? Pause the video again and see if you can do that. Well, 6/10, we could literally just go to our place value. So that's the ones place, we have a decimal. And then you have your tenths place. And so we have 6/10, so you could just put it right over there. We are putting a six in the tenths place to represent 6/10."
Math,"Now, what about a percentage? Well, percent means per 100, so one way to think about it is six over 10 is the same thing as what per 100? That is equal to, if we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 10, that's the same thing as 60 per 100. Or another way of thinking about it, 60 per, instead of 100 you could say cent. And so this would be equal to 60%. Let's do another example. So here, once again, our entire square represents a whole."
Math,"So see if you can represent this as the part that's shaded in blue as a fraction. Pause the video and do that. Well, you can see that this is a 10 by 10 grid, so there's 100 equal sections here. 100 equal sections. Each of these squares represents 1/100. And how many of them are there? Well, let's see, this row is 10, 20, 30, 40, and then one, two, three, four. So this is 44 over 100, 44/100. And we could actually represent this in other ways."
Math,"We could divide the numerator and the denominator by four, in which case you would get 11 over 25. That's another way to represent this same fraction. Now, what about as a decimal? Well, 44/100, you could say, well, you have your ones place, and then this is the same thing. You could literally just say this is 44/100. This is another way of representing 44/100. It's 4/10 and 4/100 is 44/100."
Math,"And then if you were to do a percent, well, this is 44 per 100, or 44/100, but even here I like look at it as 44 per 100 or 44%. So this is going to be 44%. And we're done.."
Math,"I'm actually separating out the percent, it's only going to be one word, but I'm writing it as, literally, per cent. Cent means the same thing as 100. So this literally means 18 per 100. Actually, I said I would do the decimal first, but we can start putting it into a fraction first. 18 per 100 as a fraction literally means 18/100. We're literally doing the fraction first. This literally means 18 per 100, or 18 hundredths."
Math,"From here we can go straight to a decimal or we could do this fraction in simplest form. Let's do the decimal first, just because that's actually what I said I would do first. Let's do that first. This is the same thing as 18 hundredths. And we know how to write that in decimal form. It's 0.18. You could view this as 1 tenth and 8 hundredths, which is the same thing, or 10 hundredths and 8 hundredths, which is 18 hundredths. So this is written in decimal form."
Math,"And if we write it as a simplified fraction, we need to see if there is a common factor for 18 and 100. And they're both even numbers, so we know they're both divisible by 2, so let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2. So we have 18 divided by 2 over 100 divided by 2. And we're going to get 18 divided by 2 is 9. 100 divided by 2 is 50. And I don't think these guys share any common factors. 50 is not divisible by 3. 9 is only divisible by 3 and 1 and 9."
Math,"So this is the fraction in simplest form. So we have 18% is the same thing as 0.18, which is the same thing, in simplest form, as 9/50. Now, I went through a lot of pain here to show you that this really just comes from the word, from percent, from per 100."
Math,"But if you ever were to see this in a problem, the fast way to do this is to immediately say, OK, if I have 18%, you should immediately say, anything in front of the percent-- that's that anything, whatever this anything is-- it should be equal to that anything. In this case it's 18/100. And another way to think about it, you could view this as 18.0%. I just added a trailing zero there, just so that you see the decimal, really."
Math,"But if you want to express this as a decimal without the percent, you just move the decimal to the left two spaces. So if we move the decimal to the left two spaces, one, two, this becomes 0.18. Or you could immediately say that 18% as a fraction is 18/100. When you put it in simplified form, it's 9/50. But you should also see that 18/100, and we have seen this, is the exact same thing as 18 hundredths, or 0.18. Hopefully, this made some connections for you and didn't confuse you.."
Math,"Or you could view this as 30 hundredths times 6, so 0.30 times 6. Now we could solve both of these, and you'll see that we'll get the same answer. If you do this multiplication right over here, 30/100-- and you could view this times 6/1-- this is equal to 180/100. And let's see. We can simplify. We can divide the numerator and the denominator by 10. And then we can divide the numerator and the denominator And we will get 9/5, which is the same thing as 1 and 4/5."
Math,"And then if we wanted to write this as a decimal, 4/5 is 0.8. And if you want to verify that, you could verify that 5 goes into 4-- and there's going to be a decimal. So let's throw some decimals in there. It goes into 4 zero times. So we don't have to worry about that. It goes into 40 eight times. 8 times 5 is 40. Subtract. You have no remainder, and you just have 0's left here. So 4/5 is 0.8. You've got the 1 there. This is the same thing as 1.8, which you would have gotten if you divided 5 into 9."
Math,"You would've gotten 1.8. So 30% of 6 is equal to 1.8. And we can verify it doing this way as well. So if we were to multiply 0.30 times 6-- let's do that. And I could just write that literally as 0.3 times 6. Well, 3 times 6 is 18. I have only one digit behind the decimal amongst both of these numbers that I'm multiplying. I only have the 3 to the right of the decimal. So I'm only going to have one number to the right of the decimal here. So I just count one number. It's going to be 1.8."
Math,"So either way you think about it or calculate it, 30% of 6 is 1.8.."
Math,"So before I even look at the choices, I'm just going to try to think of all of the ways that I can write 2% of 90. 2%, this right over here, this literally means two per 100. So I could view it as the same thing as two over 100, times 90, that's one way to write 2% of 90. Two over a 100, I can divide both the numerator and the denominator by two. And so two over a 100 is also the same thing as one over 50. And so it could also be one over 50, times 90. Now let's see what other choices they have here."
Math,"Well, I could also write 2% as a decimal. Two-hundredths should be written like this. Zero point, this is the tenths place. I have no tenths, but I have two-hundredths. So I'm multiplying that by 90. All of these right over here are equivalent to the 2%, 2% of 90. All right, now let's look at the choices. This is 0.2 times 90. This is not 2%. This actually would be two-tenths, or 20%. So let me rule that one out. This one right over here. This is two-hundredths times 90. We already wrote that down."
Math,"I like this choice. 200 times 90. No, that would be far larger than what we are looking for. We are looking for two-hundredths, not two hundreds times 90, so definitely rule that one out. Two times 90. Well, no, we're looking for 2% of 90, not two times 90. Once again, this is too large. And then we have two-hundredths times 90, which is the first thing that we wrote. And so I like this choice as well.."
Math,"And that might be a reasonable thing, but these are particular percentages that you might see a lot of in life and so it's useful to think about them in your head. For example, 1%. 1% is the same thing as 1 over 100. So 1% of 900 is the same thing as 1/100 of 900. And so this question boils down to really what is 900 divided by 100. And that of course is equal to 9. Let's do another example. What's 10% of 630? Well 10% is equal to 10 over 100, which is the same thing as 1 over 10."
Math,"So if I were to say 10% of 630, that's the same thing as saying 1/10 of 630. So this all boils down to 630 divided by 10, which you would recognize as 63. All right, let's do this next one, 20% of 45. You might recognize already, and if you haven't already, it's good to recognize that 20% is the same thing as 20 over 100, or that it's the same thing as 1 over 5. It's good to just know that hey, 20% is 1/5. So if I'm saying 1/5 of 45, that's the same thing as 45 divided by 5, which is of course, equal to 9."
Math,"Let's keep going. This is too much fun. 25%, you might recognize that's the same thing as 1/4, 25% is 25 over 100. If you divide the numerator and the denominator by 25, you're going to get 1 over 4. So this is equivalent to saying what's 1/4 of 28. Well, 28 divided by 4 is, of course, 7. Let's keep going. 50% of 128. You might recognize 50% is the same thing as 1/2. It's 50 over 100, which is equal to 1/2. And so we're really just saying what's half of 128, or what's 128 divided by 2."
Math,"And that of course would be 64. And then last but not least, 400% of 8. Well, 400%, that's the same thing as 400 over 100, or it's equal to 4. So that's really saying what's 4 times 8. So 4 times 8 is, of course, equal to 32. And we are done.."
Math,"So if you said what fraction of 16 is 4, you would say, well, look, this is the same thing as 4/16, which is the same thing as 1/4. But this is saying what fraction 4 is of 16. You'd say, well, 4 is 1/4 of 16. But that still doesn't answer our question. What percent? So in order to write this as a percent, we literally have to write it as something over 100. Percent literally means ""per cent."" The word ""cent"" you know from cents and century. It relates to the number 100. So it's per 100."
Math,"So you could say, well, this is going to be equal to question mark over 100, the part of 100. And there's a bunch of ways that you could think about this. You could say, well, look, if in the denominator to go from 4 to 100, I have to multiply by 25. In the numerator to go from-- I need to also multiply by 25 in order to have an equivalent fraction. So I'm also going to multiply by 25. So 1/4 is the same thing as 25/100. And another way of saying 25/100 is this is 25 per 100, or 25%."
Math,"So this is equal to 25%. Now, there's a couple of other ways you could have thought about it. You could have said well, 4/16, this is literally 4 divided by 16. Well, let me just do the division and convert to a decimal, which is very easy to convert to a percentage. So let's try to actually do this division right over here. So we're going to literally divide 4 by 16. Now, 16 goes into 4 zero times. 0 times 16 is 0. You subtract, and you get a 4. And we're not satisfied just having this remainder."
Math,"We want to keep adding zeroes to get a decimal answer right over So let's put a decimal right over here. We're going into the tenths place. And let's throw some zeroes right over here. The decimal makes sure we keep track of the fact that we are now in the tenths, and in the hundredths, and in the thousandths place if we have to go that far. But let's bring another 0 down. 16 goes into 40 two times. 2 times 16 is 32. If you subtract, you get 8. And you could bring down another 0."
Math,"And we have 16 goes into 80. Let's see, 16 goes into 80 five times. 5 times 16 is 80. You subtract, you have no remainder, and you're done. 4/16 is the same thing as 0.25. Now, 0.25 is the same thing as twenty-five hundredths. Or, this is the same thing as 25/100, which is the same thing as 25%.."
Math,"And if we do this, we'll get a decimal, and it's fairly straightforward to convert that decimal into a percentage. So 13 divided 20. We have the smaller number in this case being divided by the larger number. So we're going to get a value less than 1. Since we're going to get a value less than 1, let's put a decimal right over here. And let's add a couple of zeroes, as many zeroes as we would need. And we could say, hey, look, 20 goes into 13 zero times. 0 times 20 is 0. And then 13 minus 0 is 13."
Math,"Now you bring down a 0. 20 goes into 130. Let's see, it goes in-- 5 times 20 is 100. So 6 times 20 is 120. So it's going to six times. 6 times 20 is 120. You subtract. You get a 10. Let's bring down another 0. 20 goes into 100 five times. 5 times 20 is 100. And we are done. So this, written as a decimal, is 0.65. So as a decimal, it's 0.65. And if you want to write it as a percentage you essentially multiply this number by 100."
Math,"Or another way you could say is you shift the decimal point over two spots to the right. So this is going to be equal to 65%. Now, there's another way you could have done it. You could have said, look, percent literally means per hundred. So 13 out of 20 is going to be equal to what over 100? Well, to go from 20 to a 100-- forget the denominator. To go from 20 to 100, you would multiply by 5. So let's multiply the numerator by 5 as well. And 13 times 5, let's see, that's 15 plus 50, which is 65."
Math,"So this would have been a faster way to do it, especially if you recognize it's pretty easy to go from 20 to 100. You multiply it by 5. So we would do the same thing with the 13. And so you would get 65/100, which is the same thing as 65 per-- let me write this percent symbol-- 65%. And just a reminder, percent literally means per hundred, 65 per hundred, 65%.."
Math,"Notice this is [COUNTING: 1, 2] 3 2's. And when you add those 2's together, you get 6. What we're going to introduce you to in this video is the idea of repeated multiplication – a new operation that really can be viewed as repeated multiplication. And that's the operation of taking an 'exponent.' And it sounds very fancy. But we'll see with a few examples that it's not too bad. So now, let's take the idea of 2 to the 3rd power (2^3) – which is how we would say this."
Math,"(So let me write this down in the appropriate colors.) So 2 to the 3rd power. (2^3.) So you might be tempted to say, ""Hey, maybe this is 2 × 3, which would be 6."" But remember, I just said this is repeated multiplication. So if I have 2 to the 3rd power, (2^3), this literally means multiplying 3 2's together. So this would be equal to, not 2 + 2 + 2, but 2 × ... (And I’ll use a little dot to signify multiplication.) ... 2 × 2 × 2. Well, what's 2 × 2 × 2? Well that is equal to 8."
Math,(2 × 2 × 2 = 8.) So 2 to the 3rd power is equal to 8. (2^3 = 8.) Let's try a few more examples here. What is 3 to the 2nd power (3^2) going to be equal to? And I'll let you think about that for a second. I encourage you to pause the video. So let's think it through. This literally means multiplying 2 3's. So let's multiply 3 – (Let me do that in yellow.) Let's multiply 3 × 3. So this is going to be equal to 9. Let’s do a few more examples.
Math,"What is, say, 5 to the – let's say – 5 to the 4th power (5^4)? And what you'll see here is this number is going to get large very, very, very fast. So 5 to the 4th power (5^4) is going to be equal to multiplying 4 5's together. So 5^4 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5. Notice, we have [COUNTING: 1, 2, 3] 4 5's. And we are multiplying them. We are not adding them. This is not 5 × 4. This is not 20. This is 5 × 5 × 5 × 5. So what is this going to be? Well 5 × 5 is 25. (5 × 5 = 25.) 25 × 5 is 125."
Math,(25 × 5 = 125.) 125 × 5 is 625. (125 × 5 = 625.).
Math,"Now let's ask ourself an interesting question. Based on this definition of what an exponent is, what would two to the zeroth power be? I encourage you to just think about that a little bit. If you were the mathematics community, how would you define two to the zero power so it is consistent with everything that we just saw."
Math,"Well, the way we just talked about it, we just said exponentiation is you start with a one and you multiply it by the base zero times, so we're not gonna multiply it by any two, so we're just gonna be left with a one. So does this make sense that two to the zero power is equal to one? Well, let's think about it another way, and let's do a different base."
Math,"That was with two, but let's say we have three and I could say three to the fourth power, that's three times three times three times three which is going to be equal to 81, and let me just write down that this is going to be equal to 81. If I said three to the third power, that's three times three times three which is 27. Three to the second power is equal to nine. Three to the first power is equal to three."
Math,"Do you notice a pattern every time we decrease the exponent here by one? We want three to the fourth, and now we go three to the third."
Math,"What happened to the value? Well, going from 81 to 27, we divided by three, and that makes sense, because we're multiplying by one less three, so we divide by three to go from 81 to 27, we divide by three again if our exponent goes down by one, and we divide by three again when we go from nine to three, divide by three, so based on this, what do you think three to the zero power should be? Well, the pattern is every time we decrease our exponent by one, we divide by the base, and so we should divide by three again would be the logic if we follow that pattern, and so three divided by three would get us one again."
Math,"So I know it might seem a little bit counter intuitive that something to the zeroth power is going to be equal to one, but this is how the mathematics community has defined it because it actually makes a lot of sense. Either if you view an exponent as taking a one and multiplying it by the base the exponent number of times, so I'm gonna multiply one by two three times, or if you just follow this pattern, every time you decrease the exponent by one, you're going to be dividing by the base."
Math,"Either of those would get you to the conclusion that two to the zero power is one, or three to the zero power is one, or frankly, any number to the zero power is one. So if I have any number, let's say I have some number a to the zero power, this is going to be equal to one. Now I have an interesting question for you, and let's just say this is the case when a does not equal zero. I'll leave you a little bit of a puzzle for you to think about."
Math,"What do you think is zero to the zeroth power? What should zero to the zero power be? And what's interesting about zero to the zero power is you'll get a different answer if you use this technique versus if you use this technique right over here. This technique would actually get you to being one, while this technique would have you divide by zero, which we don't know how to do. Anyway, I'll leave you there to ponder the mysteries of zero to the zeroth power.."
Math,"Now, we've already learned there are two ways of thinking about this. One way is to say let's take three 2/3's. So that's one 2/3, two 2/3's, and three 2/3's. So that's one, two, three, 2/3. And then we multiply them. And we will get-- let's see, the numerator will be 2 times 2 times 2, which is 8. And the denominator's going to be 3 times 3 times 3 times 3, which is equal to 27. Now, the other way of viewing this is you start with a 1, and you multiply it by 2/3 three times."
Math,"So you multiply by 2/3 once, twice, three times. You will get the exact same result here. So let's do one more example like that. So lets say I had 4/9, and I want to square it. When I raise something to the second power, people often say, you're squaring it. Also, raising something to the third power, people sometimes say, you're cubing it. But let's raise 4/9 to the second power. Let's square it. And I encourage you to pause the video and work this out yourself."
Math,"Well, once again, you could view this as taking two 4/9's and multiplying them. Or you could view this as starting with a 1, and multiplying it by 4/9 two times. Either way, your numerator is going to be 4 times 4, which is 16. And your denominator is going to be 9 times 9, which is equal to 81.."
Math,"Now some of you might have interpreted this as we should just go from left to right. So you might've said, all right, let me first add three plus two. So I can do that part first, which is of course equal to five. And then I could multiply that times five. And that is going to get me to 25. Now others of you would have said no, that makes no sense at all. We know that we should do some operations before others. For example, multiplication should come before addition."
Math,"And so if you follow that, you would do the two times five first to get 10. And so this would become three plus 10, which is of course, going to be equal to 13. Who do you think would be right? Well, it turns out that the second way of doing it is the correct way and that's because we have something known as order of operations."
Math,"And the order of operations is the convention that mathematicians have decided to use in order for us to have one way to interpret an expression like this and the order of operations are to do parentheses first. So, for example, if you really wanted to add the three and the two first, you should put parentheses around it to say, hey, that's what you've got to do first. But then after parentheses, do exponents, which is really, you could view as repeated multiplication, then do multiplication and division."
Math,"Then do addition and subtraction. Now, some people might just memorize this as PEMDAS, or PEDMAS or something like that. And you can do that, but there's a rationale to this. Parentheses are just, the person who writing the expression saying do this for sure first. But then if you think about it, exponents are repeated multiplication and multiplication is repeated addition. So you're doing the most repeated things first, then next repeated things like multiplication."
Math,"And then you go straight to the addition. The reason why multiplication and division are on the same line and addition and subtraction on the same line is the convention there is just go left to right. So now that we are armed with our order of operations, let's tackle another slightly hairier expression. And I use the term hairy for a little bit more complex. So two times 10, minus eight, divided by four, plus one."
Math,"Pause the video and see how you could evaluate this now that you know about order of operations. All right, now let's do this together. We don't see any parentheses here. We don't see any exponents here but we do see some multiplication and division here. So we could see it over here. This two times 10. And we also have this eight divided by four. So that's what we're going to want to do first. So that two times 10, that is going to be equal to 20. The eight divided by four, is of course, equal to two."
Math,"And then we have 20 minus two plus one. And this is now going to get us, if we go left to right, which we should do when we're just adding and subtracting, is we get 20 minus two is 18, plus one, which is going to be equal to 19. And we're done. Now, you might say, well, what if we wanted someone to add the four and the one first? Well, one way to do that is you could have added a parentheses there to force it or you could have even written your division differently."
Math,"For example, you could use a fraction sign to make things clearer. If we wanted to add the four plus one first, instead of writing eight divided by four plus one like that, you could write eight over four plus one. Now of course, this is fundamentally different than this right over here. 'Cause here we would do the eight divided by four first, then add the plus one, while here, you would add the four plus one and then divide eight by that.."
Math,"Parentheses. P for parentheses. Then exponents. Don't worry if you don't know what exponents are, because this has no exponents in them. Then you're going to do multiplication and division. They're at the same level. Then you do addition and subtraction. So some people remember PEMDAS. But if you remember PEMDAS, remember multiplication, division, same level. Addition and subtraction, also at the same level. So let's figure what the order of operations say that this should evaluate to."
Math,"So the first thing we're going to do is our parentheses. And we have a lot of parentheses here. We have this expression in parentheses right there, and then even within that we have these parentheses. So our order of operations say, look, do your parentheses first, but in order to evaluate this outer parentheses-- this orange thing-- we're going to have to evaluate this thing in yellow right there. So let's evaluate this whole thing."
Math,"So how can we simplify it? Well, if we look at just inside of it, the first thing we want to do is simplify the parentheses inside the parentheses. So you see this 5 minus 2 right there? We're going to do that first no matter what. And that's easy to evaluate. 5 minus 2 is 3. And so this simplifies to-- I'll do it step by step. Once you get the hang of it, you can do multiple steps at once. So this is going to be 7 plus 3 times the 5 minus 2, which is 3. And all of those have parentheses around it."
Math,"And of course, you have all the stuff on either side-- the divide 4-- no. That's not what I want. I wanted to copy and paste. I want to copy and paste that right there. So copy, then-- no, that's giving me the wrong thing. It would've been easier-- let me just rewrite it. That's the easiest thing. I'm having technical difficulties. So divided by 4 times 2. And on this side, you had that 7 times 2 plus this thing in orange parentheses there. Now, at any step you just look again."
Math,"We always want to do parentheses first. Well, you keep wanting to do and is there really no parentheses left? So we have to evaluate this parentheses in orange here. So we have to evaluate this thing first. But in order to evaluate this thing, we have to look inside of it. And when you look inside of it, you have 7 plus 3 times 3. So if you just had 7 plus 3 times 3, how would you evaluate it? Well, look back to your order of operations."
Math,"We're inside the parentheses here, so inside of it there are no longer any parentheses. So the next thing we should do is-- there are no exponents. There is multiplication. So we do that before we do any addition or subtraction. So we want to do the 3 times 3 before we add the 7. So this is going to be 7 plus-- and the 3 times 3 we want to do first. We want to do the multiplication first. 7 plus 9. That's going to be in the orange parentheses."
Math,"And then you have the 7 times 2 plus that, on the left hand side. You have the divided by 4 times 2 on the right hand side. And now this-- the thing in parentheses-- because we still want to do the parentheses first. Pretty easy to evaluate. What's 7 plus 9? 7 plus 9 is 16. And so everything we have simplifies to 7 times 2 plus 16 divided by 4 times 2. Now we don't have any parentheses left, so we don't have to worry about the P in PEMDAS. We have no E, no exponents in this."
Math,"So then we go straight to multiplication and division. We have a multiplication-- we have some multiplication going on there. We have some division going on here, and a multiplication there. So we should do these next, before we do this addition right there. So we could do this multiplication. We could do that multiplication. 7 times 2 is 14. We're going to wait to do that addition. And then here we have a 16 divided by 4 times 2."
Math,"That gets priority of the addition, so we're going to do that before we do the addition. But how do we evaluate that? Do we do the division first, or the multiplication first? And remember, I told you in the last video, when you have 2-- when you have multiple operations of the same level-- in this case, division and multiplication-- they're at the same level. You're safest going left to right. Or you should go left to right. So you do 16 divided by 4 is 4."
Math,So this thing right here-- simplify 16 divided by 4 times 2. It simplifies to 4 times 2. That's this thing in green right there. And then we're going to want to do the multiplication next. So this is going to simplify to-- because multiplication takes priority over addition-- this simplifies to 8. And so you get 14-- this 14 right here-- plus 8. And what's 14 plus 8? That is 22. That is equal to 22. And we are done..
Math,"What is that going to be? Two to the third minus two to the first. And if you feel really confident, just pause this video and try to figure out the whole thing. Order them from least to greatest. Well two to the third, that is two times two times two, and then two to the first, well that's just two. So two times two is four, times two is eight, minus two, this is going to be equal to six. So this expression right over here could be evaluated as being equal to six."
Math,"Now, what about this right over here? What is this equal to? Well let's see, we have two squared plus three to the zero. Two squared is two times two and anything to the zero power is going to be equal to one. It's an interesting thing to think about what zero to the zeroth power should be but that'll be a topic for another video. But here we have three to the zeroth power, which is clearly equal to one. And so we have two times two plus one. This is four plus one, which is equal to five."
Math,"So the second tile is equal to five. And then three squared, well three squared, that's just three times three. Three times three is equal to nine. So if I were to order them from least to greatest, the smallest of these is two squared plus three to the zeroth power. That one is equal to five, so I'd put that on the left. Then we have this thing that's equal to six, two to the third power minus two to the first power. And then the largest value here is three squared."
Math,"So we would put that tile, three squared. We will put that tile on the right, and we're done.."
Math,"We have exponents. We have multiplication. We have addition. We have division. We have parentheses. And so to interpret this properly, we just have to remind ourselves of the order of operations. So you start with parentheses, then go to exponents, then multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction. So we see that we're going to, whatever is over here, we're eventually going to square it. That's the only place that we have the parentheses."
Math,"But how are we going to evaluate what's inside of these parentheses? So let's, then, think about, all right, we have an exponent here that we can evaluate. We know that 2 squared is the same thing as 2 times 2, which is the same thing as 4. No more exponents to evaluate. So then we go to multiplication and division. So we know by how this fraction sign is written that we need to evaluate the numerator and then divide it by the entire denominator right over here."
Math,"Now in this numerator, we have to remind ourselves that we do this multiplication before we do this addition. We don't just go left to right. So we know that it's 1 plus, and I could put parentheses here to really emphasize that we do the multiplication first. So before this gets too messy, let me just rewrite everything. I'm going to do this multiplication up here first, and actually in the denominator I'm going to do this multiplication first as well."
Math,"So this is all going to simplify to 1 over 14 or 1/14 times, Now this numerator here is going to be 1 plus 4 times 3. 4 times 3 is 12. All of that is going to be over 7 plus 2 times 3, which is of course equal to 6. And then I am going to have our plus 1 here, and then I square everything. Well now we can evaluate this numerator and this denominator. Find another color to do it in. This numerator, 1 plus 12, is going to be equal to 13. And 7 plus 6, interestingly, is also equal to 13."
Math,"So we 1/14 or 1 divided by 14 times this whole thing squared, and inside you have 13 divided by 13 plus 1. Well, we know we need to do division before we do addition. So we will want to evaluate this part before we do the addition. What is 13 divided by 13? Well that's just going to be equal to 1. So I can rewrite this as 1 over 14 times 1 plus 1, all of that squared. And now we'll want to do this parentheses. So let's do that. 1 plus 1 is going to be equal, of course, to 2."
Math,"And then we're going to do the exponents. 2 squared is, of course, equal to 4. And then we're going to multiply 1 over 14 times 4. Now you could interpret this, and they're equivalent. You could say, hey, this is the same thing as multiplying 1/14 times 4. Or you could say this is the same thing as multiplying 1 times 4 divided by 14. 1 times 4 divided by 14. Either way you look at it, you're going to get 4 over 14, and we're done."
Math,"If you want, you could rewrite this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2, and you could get 2 over 7. But that's how we can evaluate this pretty complex expression just step-by-step looking at what we can simplify first.."
Math,"And just to give you an example, I will draw a number line here. And this should all be review for you, so let me start at zero, and then this would be one. This would be two. This would be three. And you can think of these numbers, which you're used to, which we could call positive numbers, as how far we are above zero. One is one above zero. Two is two above zero."
Math,"Now what do you think negative numbers are going to be? If positive numbers are how far we are above zero, then a negative number would be how far are we below zero. So for example, if I go one to the left on this number line, that would now get us to negative one. Positive one is one to the right. Negative one is one to the left. If I were to go another one to the left, I would get to negative two, and I could keep going. As many positive numbers there are, I can have the negative version of it."
Math,"However far I am to the right, I could be that far to the left. Now some of you, especially if you live in very cold parts of the world, might have already experienced negative numbers in some way. For example, if you look at a thermometer, this has both a Celsius thermometer, right over here, and Fahrenheit. We know that you can get temperatures below zero degrees Celsius and temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit."
Math,"On this thermometer, they just mark how far we are below zero with these red numbers, but really these are negative numbers. And we specify negative numbers by putting that negative sign right in front of it like that. So for example, 20 degrees Celsius is positive of 20 degrees Celsius is actually a pretty comfortable temperature, but negative 20 degrees Celsius, that is below, 20 degrees Celsius below the freezing point of water, that is a very, very, very, very cold temperature."
Math,"One is 20 degrees above zero. One is 20 degrees below zero. So a big picture, for any given number, there's a negative version of it. For example, this right over here would be positive six, and then you could have negative six. But negative six is six below zero or six left of the zero on the number line, while positive six is, of course, six above zero. So I will leave you there. You might be thinking, ""Oh wow, this looks a lot like a subtraction sign."
Math,"Maybe it is related to subtraction somehow."" Or ""How can I do addition and subtraction, multiplication and division with negative numbers?"" And for that we will go to future videos.."
Math,"Opposite. This is just the symbol for number or shorthand for number. So if the number is four, what is its opposite? Well, four is one, two, three, four to the right of zero. Positive four is four to the right of zero. So its opposite is going to be one, two, three, four to the left. So it's going to be negative four. Or another way to think about it, if you have a positive number, its opposite is going to be the negative of that number."
Math,"So another way of thinking about it is, is that this negative literally means opposite. One way to think about it, this is the number that is the opposite of four. So let me write this down. So if I write negative four. Negative, let me write this, negative four. That literally means... So you can take this negative symbol as meaning opposite. Opposite. Opposite of four. Opposite of four. If you were to say negative, instead of saying a specific number let's just say a letter that could represent a number."
Math,"So if I said negative A, that means the opposite of the number A. That means the opposite... Opposite of... Let me do that in blue color. Opposite of A. Of A. And if this confuses you a little bit just look, A could be any number right over here. So let me draw a number line just so this can be a little bit, make a little bit more sense hopefully. So this is a number line. Let me put some tick marks here."
Math,"I don't know much each of these tick marks jump but let's say that A is some number that is right over here. Well negative A is going to be the opposite of A. So if A is three tick marks to the right negative A is going to be three tick marks to the left. One, two, three. And so the opposite of A is going to be this value right over here. And we can write that, we can write opposite of A over here. We could literally write opposite, opposite of A is that number right over there."
Math,"Or as a shorthand, we can just write-- We can just write negative. We can just write this is negative A right over here. Negative A. So with that in mind, if we literally view this negative symbol as meaning the opposite of whatever this is, let's try something interesting. What would be the negative-- Let me do this in another color. What would be the negative of negative three? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Well we just said, this negative means the opposite."
Math,"So you can think about this as meaning this means the opposite... Opposite of negative-- The opposite of negative three. So what is the opposite of negative three? Well negative three is three to the left of zero. One, two, three. So it's opposite is going to be three to the right of zero. One, two, three. So it's going to be positive three. So this is equal to positive three. Or we could just write positive three like that."
Math,"So hopefully this gives you a better appreciation for what opposite means and also how it relates to the actual negative symbol. We could keep going. We could do something like what is the negative of the negative of negative-- Let me do a different number. Of negative two. Well, this part right over here the negative, the opposite of negative two, which is really the opposite of the opposite of two, well that's just going to be two. Every time you say opposite you flip over the number line."
Math,"So this flips you over the number line two to the left and this flips you back two to the right so all of this is going to be two but then you're going to take the opposite of two so that's just going to be negative two. If you threw another negative in front of this, it would be the opposite of all of this. So it would be the opposite of negative two and then all of a sudden it would become positive. So every time you put that negative in front there you're flipping on the other side of the number line.."
Math,"And let's put some numbers on this number line. We can start at zero, and if we go to the right we have positive numbers. One, two, three, four, five. As we go to the left we get more and more negative. So negative one, negative two, negative three, negative four, and I can keep going on and on and on. Let's pick one of these numbers. Let's say that we pick the number three."
Math,"What is going to be the opposite of the number three? Well the opposite of the number is a number that's the same distance from zero but on the other side. So three is three to the right of zero. One, two, three. So its opposite is going to be three to the left of zero. One, two, three. So the opposite of three is negative three. Let me make a little table here. If we have the number, the number. And then we have its opposite. We have its opposite."
Math,"So we just figured out that if you have the number three, its opposite is going to be negative three. Now what if your number is negative? What if your number, let's say the number negative four. What's the opposite of that? And I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it on your own. Well, you say, okay, negative four is right over here. That's negative four. It is four to the left of zero. One, two, three, four to the left of zero. So its opposite is going to be four to the right of it."
Math,"So one, two, three, four. It's going to be positive. It's going to be positive four. So you're probably starting to see a pattern here. The opposite of a number is going to be the opposite sign of that number. If you have a positive three here, its opposite is going to be negative three. If you start with negative four, its opposite is going to be positive four. One way to think about it, it's going to have the same absolute value but have a different sign."
Math,"Or another way to think about it is, however if this is three to the right of zero, its opposite is going to be three to the left of zero. Or if the number is four to the left of zero, its opposite is going to be four to the right of zero. So we'll do one last one. What is the opposite of... What's going to be the opposite of one? Well one is one to the right of zero, so its opposite is going to be one to the left of zero, or negative one."
Math,"Or another way to think about it, one is positive so its opposite is where you're going to change the sign. Instead of being positive it's going to be negative. It's going to be negative one. Either way that you can think about it.."
Math,"And let's see, this is negative 2. This is positive 2. So each of these big slashes look like it's 1. So this would be negative 1, negative 2. This right over here would be negative 0.5. So we're going to go a little bit more negative than negative 0.5. That would be negative 0.6. We want to go another tenth. And so that looks right at about negative 0.6. Let's do a couple more of these. Move the orange dot to 1.9 on the number line. So it seems like we have the same scale as in the previous example."
Math,"This gets us to 1. In fact, this is 0.5, 1, 1.5. And 1.9 is only going to be a tenth less than 2. So it's going to be-- let's see, that's 2, so a tenth less than that. And I'm assuming that it's locking us to the tenths. And it looks like it is, so that looks pretty close to 1.9. Let's do one more of these. Move the orange dot to 0.5 on the number line. Well, once again, we have the same scale. It's important to always check the scale. And this right over here is 1."
Math,"So 0.5 would be halfway, so that little small mark right over there.."
Math,"Then we get 1/3. 1/3. So 1/3 is between zero and one. We can actually split this into thirds. So that would be 1/3, 2/3, and then 3/3, which is one, so 1/3 is going to sit right over there. It's 1/3 of the way from zero to one, that's 1/3. Let me write that. That's 1/3 right over there. Then we have negative 1.2. I'll do that in this blue color. Negative 1.2. So, negative one is right over here. This is more negative than negative one. It's negative 1.2."
Math,"It's negative one, and then another .2, so it's going to be right over here. This is negative 1.2. Zero is pretty straight forward. Zero is right over there. It's even labeled for us at zero. Five was labeled for us too at five. Then we have negative two and 1/4. So let's go to negative two. Negative two is here, and it's going to be more negative than negative two. It's negative two and then another another negative 1/4. So it's negative two, and then we go 1/4 of the way to negative three."
Math,"So negative 2 and 1/4 is going to be right over here. So negative two and 1/4. And then finally we have 4.1. 4.1. So four is right over here. .1 is another tenth greater than four, another tenth on the way to five. So four and 1/10 is going to be right over here. 4.1. 4.1. And we are done.."
Math,"All right, now let's do it together. So let's first compare -7/4 to -3/4. And I'm going to try to do that by visualizing them on a number line. So let me draw a straighter line. There we go. Let's see, they're both negative, which means both to the left of zero. So I'll focus on the left of zero. So that's zero. And let's see, they're both given in fourths and we need to go all the way to 7/4, less than zero. So let me think of each of these as a fourth. So one, two, three, four. That would be -1."
Math,"One, two, three, four. That would be -2 and that's enough for us, but I could keep going if I liked. Now, where is -7/4 on this number line? Well, I just said each of these is a fourth, so negative 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4. So this right over here is -7/4. And where is negative -3/4 on the number line? - 1/4, -2/4, -3/4. So which one is greater? Well, we can see that -3/4 is to the right of -7/4. So -3/4 is greater or that -7/4 is less than -3/4. So I'll put a less than right over here."
Math,"Let's do this next example. We're going to compare 0.6 to -1.8. If you haven't already given it a shot or if this previous example helped inspire something and you give it another shot, and then we'll do it together. So let's draw a number line again. And let me put zero right over here. That's 1. That's 2. This is -1. This is -2. And actually let me make half marks here, so we can get a little bit closer to thinking about where these two numbers sit on the number line. I'll start with 0.6."
Math,"0.6 is you could view that as 6/10. It's a little bit more than 5/10. It's a little bit more than 1/2. So 0.6 is gonna be roughly right around here on our number line, 0.6. And where is -1.8? Well, it's negative. So it's going to be to the left of zero, and we're gonna go 1.8 to the left. So this is -1. This is -2, that's too far. This is -1.5. - 1.8 is going to be roughly, let me do this in this color, right over here. It's going to be roughly right over there, -1.8."
Math,"And so you can see that it is left of 0.6 on our number line. And so -1.8 is less than 0.6, or 0.6 is greater than -1.8. Let's do more examples here. Let's compare these two numbers. Well, once again, let me put them on a number line. And I wanna show you that the number line does not have to go left-right. It could go up-down. So let's try that. And I'll do it in a different color. So I'll make a line like this. And I am going to have, let's call this zero right over here. And so this is 1. This is 2."
Math,"This is -1. This is -2. Now, where is 2 1/5 on the number line? So that is positive 1, positive 2. And then we're going to go about a fifth. So that'll get us roughly right over there. And then where is -1 1/10? Well, we're not gonna go below zero, so -1. And we're gonna go another 1/10 beyond that below zero. So it's gonna be roughly around there. So that is -1 1/10. And so we can see that -1 1/10 is less than positive 2 1/5, or positive 2 1/5 is greater than -1 1/10."
Math,"Let's do one last example, comparing these two numbers here. And actually, I can extend this number line right over here, and I should be able to fit both of these numbers. So let me try to do that. So I'm going to extend it. This is -3 right over here. So where would -1.5 sit? Well, we're going below zero so that's a -1. - 1.5 would be another half, it'd be right in between -1 and -2. So -1.5 is right over there. And where would -2.5 be? Well, we go -1, -2, and then another half."
Math,"So this right over here is -2.5. And we could see very clearly that -1.5 is higher than -2.5, so it is also greater. And we're done.."
Math,"He mixed 3/2 cups of wheat flour. 3/2 is the exact same thing as 1 and 1/2, if we were to write it as a mixed number. So it's more than 1 cup of wheat flour. And he mixes his that with 3/4 cups of regular flour. Well, 3/4 is less than 1, so 3/2 is definitely greater than 3/4. And we can just pick greater than right over there. 3/2 is greater than 3/4. Let's do a couple more of these. One of the deepest points in the Indian Ocean, the Diamantina trench, is at negative 8 kilometers."
Math,"We say it is negative 8 kilometers because it is 8 kilometers below sea level. The deepest part of the Bering Strait is at negative 5 and 4/9 kilometers. Write an inequality to show the relationship between these two points, and determine which point is deeper. Let's see. We have a greater than sign here. So we want to write whichever quantity is greater on the left-hand side. We look right over here. This number, negative 5 and 4/9, it is less negative. So it's actually going to be greater value."
Math,"It's not as deep. We can write negative 5 and 4/9 kilometers is greater than negative 8 kilometers. And so if we're thinking about which point is deeper, it's going to be the one that's more negative, because that tells us how far below sea level we are. So the negative 8 kilometer point is further below sea level. Let's see. Negative 8 kilometers. The Diamantina trench at negative 8 kilometers is the deeper point. This is fun, because in some of these questions you actually learn things."
Math,"I always thought that the deepest part of the Bering Sea-- well, anyway. We can talk about that another time. Negative 8 kilometers, so the Diamantina trench is deeper. Let's do one more. John is making noodles. To make the batter, he mixes 11/16 cups tapioca flour with 3/8 rice flour and some water. Write an inequality to express the relationship between the tapioca flour and rice flour. So we're really comparing 11/16 cups of tapioca to 3/8 cups rice flour. So we're really comparing these two fractions."
Math,"And at first it might seem hard to compare. You have different denominators. But 3/8 could easily be converted to a fraction with 16 as the denominator. What would you do? Well, if you doubled both the 3 and the 8-- you have to do the same thing to the numerator and the denominator-- this fraction 3/8 is equivalent to 6/16. And then you would have the same denominator. You could compare 11/16 to 6/16."
Math,"Well, if you have the same denominator and this numerator is greater, 11 is greater than 6, 11/16 is going to be greater than 6/16, which is the same thing as 3/8. And we got it right.."
Math,"And you might be tempted to say oh, well, you know, if these were all positive, 40 would be the greatest. So you might be tempted to say negative 40 is the greatest. But you have to realize what the negative is telling you, and to think about that. Think about if these were your dollar amounts in your bank account. Would you rather have negative $40 in your bank account or negative $7 in your bank account? Negative 40 means that you owe the bank $40. So it's 40 less than having nothing."
Math,"Negative 7 would mean that you owe the bank only $7. So it's actually the case that negative 40 is less than negative 7. And out of all of these numbers, it is the least of all of them. So negative 40 is the very least that you could do. That's the least amount of money that you would want out of these comparisons in your bank account, or the smallest amount of money. You owe the bank $40. Not only do you have nothing, you owe the bank $40. Then the next smallest number would be negative 30."
Math,"And then the next smallest after that would be negative 25. And then the next smallest after that would be negative 10. And then finally, the greatest of all of these numbers-- and I will do it in pink-- the greatest of all of these numbers is negative 7. And if it's still not obvious to you, you could also think of them in temperature terms. Which of these is the coldest temperature, whether you're talking about Celsius or Fahrenheit? Negative 40 would be the coldest temperature."
Math,"Negative 7 would be the warmest temperature. There would be the most heat in the air at negative 7. Another way to think about it is we could draw a number line. So let's draw a number line right over here. If this is a zero, and we could put maybe positive 7 up here. Positive 7 isn't one of these numbers, but then we could plot all the other numbers. So this right here might be negative 7. If that's negative 7, then maybe this right over here would be negative 10."
Math,"Notice we go further and further to the left of zero. And then we go a little bit further to the left. We get negative 25. A little bit further to the left than that is negative 30. And then you go even further to the left and you get to negative 40. So if you think of it this way, the least of these numbers is the one that's furthest to the left on the number line, and the greatest is the one that's furthest to the right.."
Math,"So assuming you've had a go at it, so let's do it together, and to help us there, let's plot these numbers on a number line, and I have a number line up here, so there you go, there is a handy number line. And let's just take them one by one. So the first number here, we have 7/3. So let's see if we can express that in a different way, if we can write that as a mixed number. So 7/3, how many wholes are here? And the whole is going to be 3/3."
Math,"So this is going to be 3/3, plus another 3/3, is going to get us to 6/3. And so you're going to have one more third left. So this is 7/3. Three plus three, plus one is seven. So this is 3/3 is one whole, three thirds is one whole, so this is two and 1/3."
Math,"So seven thirds, same thing as one, two, and you see, between consecutive integers, we have three spaces, so we are essentially marking off thirds, so two and 1/3, is going to be 1/3 of the way between two and three, so it's going to be right over there, so that is 7/3. Then we have negative 5/2, so same logic. Negative, let me do that in that green color. So, I can do it over here."
Math,"Negative five over two, well that's the same thing as the negative of 5/2, and 5/2 is going to be 2/2 plus another 2/2, plus 1/2 so this is two and 1/2, this is one, this is one, and that's 1/2. So this is going to be one, plus one, plus 1/2, two and 1/2, we have our negative out there, so it's negative two and 1/2. Let's see, negative one, negative two, and the negative two and 1/2 is going to be halfway between negative two, and negative three, so it's going to be right over there."
Math,"So that is negative 5/2. Then we have zero, not too difficult. It's actually labeled on our number line for us. Then we have negative two. Negative two, once again, on our number line for us. Two, two steps, two whole numbers to the left of zero. So negative two is going to put us right over there. Then we have negative 12/4 so it might jump out at you immediately, 12 divided by four is three, so this is going to be the same thing as negative three."
Math,"So this is negative 12/4 or if you want to use the type of logic that we used in these first two numbers, you could say negative 12/4 is the same thing as the negative of 12/4 which is 4/4 plus another 4/4 so that gets us to 8/4 plus another 4/4 that's 12/4. This is one, two, and three, or negative three. So negative three is the same thing as negative 12/4. And then finally, one more number, negative 3.25."
Math,"So you could view this, this is the same thing, negative 3.25 is the same thing as negative three and 25/100 and 25/100 is the same thing as 1/4. 25 is 1/4 of 100. So this is the same thing as negative three and 1/4. So let's see, let's go negative one, negative two, negative three, and then we have to go a fourth, and we're not going to be able to do it super precisely, but it's going to be less than 1/3, so it's going to be right over there. So that right over there, is negative 3.25."
Math,"So we wanted the numbers ordered from least to greatest, well, we've done that. The least is negative 3.25, Then negative 12/4, then negative 5/2, then negative two, then zero, then 7/3, and we are done.."
Math,"So let me just draw a fast number line over here. So let's just put 0 right over here, since we're thinking about the distance from 0. So let's just think about the absolute value. Let's think about the absolute value of x when x is equal to 5. So that's equivalent to the absolute value of 5. We just substituted 5 for x. The absolute value of 5 is the distance of 5 from the 0. So you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5 is exactly 5 to the right of 0. So the absolute value of 5 is just 5."
Math,"Now I think you already get to see this is a pretty straightforward concept. Now let's do something a little more interesting, the absolute value of x when x is equal to negative 10. So let's just put negative 10 in for x. This is the distance that negative 10 is from 0. And so let's just go negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6, negative 7, negative 8, negative 9, negative 10. I should extend the number line more. So this right here is negative 10."
Math,"So how far is it away from 0? Well, it's 10 to the left of 0. So you put a 10 here. And so in general, absolute value will always be a positive quantity. And when we're rethinking about just absolute values of just numbers, it's just going to be, really, the positive version of that number. Let's do one more. Well, they tell us to do one more, the absolute value of x when x is equal to negative 12. So we have the absolute value of negative 12. We don't even to look at the number line."
Math,"It's just going to be the positive version of negative 12. It's just going to be equal to 12. And this is just saying that negative 12 is 12 away from 0. And we could draw it over here. This is negative 11. Negative 12 is right over here. It is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 away from 0.."
Math,"So this is where I live. So that's me right over here. And that you live three miles to the left of the school. So this is where you would be, three miles to the left. Or maybe we could say that's to the west of the school. Now you could say that your position is at negative three miles relative to the school. And my position is at positive three miles relative to the school."
Math,"But what we might care about is just how far are we from the school? And so there, you could say, well, we're each exactly three miles from the school. You're three miles from the school, and I am three miles from the school. And that's what absolute value is actually trying to get at."
Math,"So for example, your position is negative three, but if we were to take the absolute value, which you denote by these two straight up down bars around the number, then we say, that's just going to be your distance from zero, which is just going to be three miles. Similarly, my position is at three miles, positive three miles. The absolute value of that is going to be, drum roll, please. It is going to be three as well. You might already see a pattern."
Math,"If you're taking an absolute value of a negative number, you get the number without the negative. And if you take the absolute value of a positive number, it just equals itself again. But the reason why that is the case is because we're just saying, how far is that thing from zero? Let me give you another example. Let's say that we have some type of a cruise ship, and that's the water right over there. This is the cruise ship. Let me draw it."
Math,"It's this big cruise ship, nice and big one, has water slides on it, and whatever else, whatever you would expect from a huge cruise ship. And let say, we think about the height of where the different floors are in the ship. And a natural place to think about is based on where the sea level is. So we call that height zero. Now there's this big waterfall pool type thing up here. Let's just say, it's a pool for simplicity, on the roof. And let's say that that is at an altitude of 80 feet."
Math,"So we would call that at positive 80 feet. And let's say the engine room is right over here. And if you wanted to know its position, its height, well, it is going to be below zero, it's below sea level, let's say it's at negative 20 feet. So that would give you its position. One is 80 feet above the sea level, and then one is 20 feet below the sea level. But if you just wanted to know how far they are, well, you could take the absolute value."
Math,"How far is that roof deck pool? Well, you take the absolute value of 80. You are going to get 80. How far is that engine room from zero? How far is it from sea level? Well, the absolute value of negative 20 is going to be 20.."
Math,"Four inequalities that involve absolute value. And what I want to do is figure out which is these inequalities are true, given where a, c and b are on the number line. And I encourage you to pause the video and try to think through it on your own. All right, let's look at this first one. It says that, ""a is less than b."" So if we look at a and we look at b, a is clearly to the left of b on the number line. So we know that this is true."
Math,"Even more we know that a is negative, it's to the left of zero, while b is positive. Which is, if one thing is negative and the other thing is positive, the negative thing is definitely going to be less than the positive thing. But even easier than that, a is to the left of b on the number line. If you're to the left of something else on the number line you're less than that other thing. Because the number line, at least the way we've constructed it, it increases from left to right."
Math,"All right, the next statement, ""The absolute value of a is greater than the absolute value of b."" Well, let's just think about where these are on the number line. So we've already said a is three hash marks to the left of zero. That is a. So what is going to be the absolute value of a? Well, the absolute value of a is the distance that a is from zero. So the distance that a is from zero is one, two, three hash marks. So the absolute value of a is just going to be that same distance on the positive side."
Math,"So the point that we marked as c is also the absolute value of a. So that is also the absolute value of a. The absolute value of a -- sorry, a is three to the left of zero. Absolute value of a is going to be three to the right. It's just a measure of, how many hash marks is it from zero? Well, it's three hash marks from zero so we put it right over here."
Math,"So is the absolute value of a greater than the absolute value of b? Or what's the absolute value of b? Well, b is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight hash marks to the right of zero. And so the absolute value of b is going to be on the eighth hash mark. Because it's eight hash marks to the right. So this is also the absolute value of b. And this is consistent with what we've learned about absolute value. Absolute value of a positive number is just going to be that number again."
Math,"Absolute value of a negative number is going to be the opposite of that number. And absolute value of zero is just going to be zero. So is the absolute value of a greater than the absolute value of b? Well, no. Absolute value of a is to the left of the absolute value of b on our number line. It is less than the absolute value of b. So this is not true. All right, next statement."
Math,"""Absolute value of a is less than the absolute value of c."" Well, we already know that the absolute value of a is the same value as c. So what's the absolute value of c? Well, the absolute value of a positive number is just going to be that number. So this point right over here is also the absolute value of c. So we see that the absolute value of a is equal to the absolute value of c. It's not less than. So we are going to mark that off."
Math,"We could have written, ""Absolute value of a is equal to absolute value of c."" That would have been true. All right, last one. a is less than c. Well, once again a is to the left of c on the number line. So that is true, because our number line is increasing as we go from left to right. If one number is to the left of another number, it is less than the other number. So a is indeed less than c. And we are done.."
Math,"So assuming you have, you had a try at it, so the easiest way I can think about it, well let's just, let's just plot them all on a number line. And you might want to draw it out or eventually you kind of have a number line in your head, and you can think about it that way. So let's first think about the absolute value of value of -27. So what is the absolute value of -27? Well it's just going to be +27. This right over here is the same thing as +27, because -27 is 27 to the left of 0. 27 to the left of 0."
Math,"So let's plot the absolute value of -27. Well it's really 27, so it's going to be right over here. So that is the absolute value of -27. It is +27. Alright, then we have -17. Well, -17, let's see each hash mark here is 3, so this is -9 and -12, -15. So -17 is gonna be right around there. So that is -17. And then we have -28. So we have -27 and each hash mark is 3, so -28 is going to be right over there. -28. And then finally we have -22.4."
Math,"So let's see, we have 18, 21, 22 would be here, so 22.4 is going to be roughly right over there. So that is 22.4. So if we want to sort it from least to greatest, well, we just have to start at the left end of the number line. The smallest of them, or the least of them, is -28. Then we go to -17. -17. Then we go to 22.4. Then we go to 22.4. And then we go to the absolute value of -27, and we are done.."
Math,"Let's look at what the absolute values mean, and then we should probably be able to do this comparison. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. One is you could draw them on the number line. So if this is 0, if this is negative 7, and then this is negative 9 right over here. Now, when you take the absolute value of a number, you're really saying how far is that number from 0, whether it's to the left or to the right of 0. So, for example, negative 9 is 9 to the left of 0."
Math,"So the absolute value of negative 9 is exactly 9. This evaluates to 9, Negative 7 is exactly 7 to the left of 0. So the absolute value of negative 7 is positive 7. And so if you were to compare 9 and 7, this is a little bit more straightforward. 9 is clearly greater than 7. And if you ever get confused with the greater than or less than symbols, just remember that the symbol is larger on the left-hand side. So that's the greater than side."
Math,"If I were to write this-- and this is actually also a true statement. If you took these without the absolute value signs, it is also true that negative 9 is less than negative 7. Notice the smaller side is on the smaller number. And so that's the interesting thing. Negative 9 is less than negative 7, but their absolute value, since negative 9 is further to the left of 0, it is-- the absolute value of negative 9, which is 9, is greater than the absolute value of negative 7."
Math,"Another way to think about it is if you take the absolute value of a number, it's really just going to be the positive version of that number. So if you took the absolute value of 9, that equals 9. Or the absolute value of negative 9, that is also equal to 9. Well, when you think of it visually, that's because both of these numbers are exactly 9 away from 0. This is 9 to the right of 0, and this is 9 to the left of 0. Let's do a few more of these."
Math,"So let's say that we wanted to compare the absolute value of 2 to the absolute value of 3. Well, the absolute value of a positive number is just going to be that same value. 2 is two to the right of 0, so this is just going to evaluate to 2. And then the absolute value of 3, that's just going to evaluate to 3. It's actually pretty straightforward. So 2 is clearly the smaller number here. And so we clearly get 2 is less than 3, or the absolute value of 2 is less than 3."
Math,"So we have a less than right over here. Let's say you wanted to compare-- I'm trying to find a suitable color-- the absolute value of negative 8 to the absolute value of 8. Well, one way to think about is that they're both 8 away from 0. This 8 to the left of 0. This is 8 to the right of 0. So both of these things evaluate to 8. Absolute value of negative 8 is 8. Absolute value of 8 is 8. And so, clearly, 8 is equal to 8. Let me do a couple more examples."
Math,"Let's say I wanted to compare the absolute value of negative 1, and I want to compare that to positive 2. So the absolute value of negative 1 is just the positive version of 1, or it's just the positive version of negative 1, which is just 1. So 1 is clearly less than 2. Or the other way to think about it, the absolute value of negative 1 is clearly less than 2.."
Math,"So let's think about which of these x values would make this true. And before I even try out the x values, let's see if we can simplify this inequality. Now the thing that might jump out at you and encourage you to try these on your own before I work through them, what might jump out at you is that we know what the absolute value of negative seven is. The absolute value of negative seven is how far from zero is negative seven? Well, it's seven to the left."
Math,"The distance from negative seven to zero is seven, or another way to think about it is the absolute value of any number is always going to be the non-negative version of it. So this right over here, absolute value of negative seven is just going to be seven. So an equivalent inequality would be that the absolute value of x needs to be less than seven. So let's see if its true for x equals negative eight. So if x equals negative eight, then wherever we see the x we put a negative eight there."
Math,"So let's see, is the absolute value of negative eight less than seven? Is that true? Well, the absolute value of negative eight is just going to be eight, so is eight less than seven? No, it's greater than seven. So that, x equals negative eight does not satisfy the inequality. Now x equals negative two? Well, wherever we see an x, let's put a negative two. So the absolute value of negative two needs to be less than seven. What's the absolute value of negative two? Well it's going to be positive two."
Math,"Is positive two less than seven? Sure, two is less than seven. So this, this is x equals negative two, satisfies our inequality. The absolute value of negative two is going to be less than the absolute value of negative seven. Then, finally, x equals six. So the absolute value is the absolute value of six. Once again, everywhere I see the x I just put the six there. X equals six."
Math,"We're going to say the absolute value of six, is that less than seven? Well the absolute value of six is once again, just six, Six is six to the right of zero. Is six less than seven? Yeah, sure, six is less than seven. So x equals six and x equals negative two both satisfy the inequality. Now let's do this one here in this magenta color. And once again, encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it out on your own. Let's try x equals negative four."
Math,"So if x equals negative four, we're going to say the absolute value of negative four is greater than five. Absolute value of negative four, well that's just going to be four. Is four greater than five? No, four is less than five. So that doesn't work. Now, x equals three. Everywhere we see the x, replace it with a three. The absolute value of three, is that greater than five? Absolute value of three is just three, so is three greater than five? No, three is less than five."
Math,"I think you're seeing, hopefully you're getting the hang of it. So finally, if x equals negative nine. The absolute value of negative nine, that would need to be greater than five. Absolute value of negative nine, well that's just going to be positive nine. So it's just going to be nine, and is that greater than five? Well, sure, nine is greater than five. So x equals negative nine satisfies the inequality. All right, now let's do these ones in this light purple color."
Math,"The absolute value of x needs to be greater than negative 16. So there's something very interesting about this one. We don't even have to look at the choices here. Can you think of any x for which this would not be true? Well just think about it a little bit. The absolute value of a number, is it ever going to be negative? No, the absolute value of a number is going to be zero or positive. It's going to be non-negative, so this right over here is zero or positive, or we could call that non-negative."
Math,"Zero or positive. So if this thing over here is zero or positive, something that is zero or greater, something that is zero or positive is always going to be greater than a negative number. So this is actually true for all x's. We don't even have to try them out."
Math,"We could try them out, actually we will try them out, just so you see that, but it's going to be true for all x's, because when you take the absolute value, if you take, if x is zero it's going to be zero, but for any other value, any non-zero value of x, the absolute value of it is going to be positive. And let's just see that, we could put any x there, and this statement's going to be true. Absolute value of x equals negative 15."
Math,"Well, the absolute value of negative 15, is that greater than negative 16? Well, the absolute value of negative 15 is positive 15, and of course positive 15 is going to be greater than negative 16. A positive is always going to be greater than a negative. So this is true. If x equals three, absolute value of three, is that greater than negative 16? Oh, whoops let me write it that way. Absolute value of three, is that greater than negative 16? Sure, absolute value of three is three."
Math,"And three is positive, so it's going to be greater than a negative number. So that works. And as I said, any x would work there. And finally if x equals nine. Well, absolute value of nine, if x equals nine, is that greater than negative 16? Well sure, that's just nine, and that is greater than negative 16. Even if x was zero, then you would have zero is greater than negative 16, which is absolutely true. So any x here works.."
Math,"So if you take their ending weight and from that you subtract their starting weight. So, let me just write that, that's your end weight minus your starting weight. That's going to be your change in weight over that month. And so we have the change in weights here. So, Jenna's change in weight is negative three pounds which means that she lost weight. Sarah's change in weight is positive 2 1/2 pounds which means she gained 2 1/2 pounds."
Math,"And then Bill's change in weight is positive four pounds which means he gained four pounds over the month. So, given that, let's answer some questions. Who lost the most weight? Who had the largest change in weight? And who had the smallest change in weight? And I encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it on your own. Well let's just plot all of these on a number line here to help us think through it, although some of you might already have an answer here."
Math,"So Jenna's weight change is negative three pounds. So that's Jenna right over there. I'll say J for Jenna. Sarah's weight change, and she had a weight gain is 2 1/2 pounds so that's right over there. Positive 2 1/2 pounds for Sarah. And then finally Bill gained four pounds so that is Bill right over there."
Math,"Now let's answer the question, who lost the most? So when we talk about lost, where we care about directions, we said hey, who moved most to the left of zero? Well Sarah and Bill didn't move to the left of zero at all. They gained weight. That's why they're to the right of zero. Jenna's the only person who lost anything. So the person who lost the most is Jenna."
Math,"Now who had the largest change? And if we think about the largest change, one way to think about it is, who is the furthest away from zero? So one way to think about it is, which of these is the largest absolute value? Well the absolute value here, the absolute value of negative three is, and we can just call this the absolute change, is just going to be the absolute value. The absolute value of negative three is positive three. Absolute value of 2.5 is 2.5. Let me make this a little bit clearer."
Math,"Absolutue value of four is just equal to four. So who had the largest absolute change? Well Bill had the largest absolute change and then second place was actually Jenna. She lost weight, but she had a pretty big change. She had a three pound change although it was a three pound loss. Bill's was a four pound gain. But the largest change is definitely Bill. Now who had the least change? Well another way to think about it, this is the least absolute change."
Math,"Who changed the least from zero? Well if you look at here, Sarah had the smallest absolute change. Jenna lost weight so the weight change of Jenna, she has negative three vs. Sarah's positive 2.5. But if we talk about who had the least change from zero. If your weight change was zero, that means you didn't gain or lose weight from the beginning of the month to the end of the month. So who had the least change? Well that's the least absolute change? Well, we see that right over here."
Math,2.5 is less than three or four. So the least change is Sarah. And we're done..
Math,"Now, you might also realize that the number of tips or the amount of tips I might make in an hour can change dramatically from hour to hour. It can vary-- one hour it might be lunchtime, get a lot of tips, people might get some big-ticket items. The next hour, I might not have any customers. And then my tips might be really low. So the tips part right over here, we consider that-- the entire word, we consider that to be a variable. From scenario to scenario, it can change."
Math,"So for example, in one scenario, maybe it's lunchtime. I'm getting really big tips. So tips is-- let's say it's equal to $30. And so the total amount I might make in that hour-- we can go back to this expression right over here-- it's going to be 10 plus-- instead of writing tips here, I'll write 30 because that's what my tips are in that hour. And so that is going to be equal to 40. Let me do it in that yellow color. It's going to be equal to $40. But let's say right after that, the restaurant slows down."
Math,"We're out of the lunch hour for whatever reason. Maybe the restaurant next door has a big sale or something. And so the next hour, my tips go down dramatically. My tips go down to $5 for that hour. Now I go back to this expression. The total I make is my hourly wage plus the $5 in tips, which is equal to $15. As you see, this entire expression-- the 10 plus tips-- it changed depending on what the value of the variable tips is. Now, you won't see whole words typically used in algebra as variables."
Math,"We get lazy. And so instead, we tend to use just easier-to-write symbols. And so in this context, instead of writing tips, maybe we could have just written 10 plus t, where t represents the tips that we get in an hour. And so then we would say, OK, what happens when t is equal to 30? Well, then, we have a situation. t is equal to 30. This evaluates to 10 plus 30, which would be 40. What would happen if t is equal to 5? Well, then, this would evaluate to 10 plus 5, which is equal to 15."
Math,"Now, I want to be clear. We didn't even have to use t. We didn't even really have to use a letter, although in traditional algebra, you almost do use a letter. We could have written it as 10 plus x, where x is your tips per hour. x might not be as natural. It's not the first letter in the word tips. Or you could have even written 10 plus star, where you could say star represents the number of tips in an hour. But it just might have not made as much intuitive sense."
Math,But hopefully this gives you a general idea of just what a variable is. All it is is a symbol that represents varying values. And that's why we call it a variable..
Math,"So we have an expression here. And the first thing I want to think about are the terms of an expression or what a term is. And one way to think about it is the terms are the things that are getting added and subtracted. So, for example, in this expression right over here, you have three things that are getting added and subtracted. The first thing, you're taking 2 times 3. You're adding that to 4. And then from that, you're subtracting 7y. So in this example, you have three terms."
Math,"The first term is 2 times 3. The second term is just the number 4. And the third term is 7 times y. Now, let's think about the term ""factor."" And when people are talking about a factor, especially in terms of an expression, they're talking about the things that are getting multiplied in each term. So, for example, if you said, what are the factors of the first term? The first term refers to this one right over here-- 2 times And there's two factors."
Math,"There's a 2 and a 3, and they are being multiplied by each other. So here you have two factors in the first term. What about the second term? This was the first term. The second term here has only one factor, just the 4. It's not being multiplied by anything. And the third term here, once again, has two factors. It's the product of 7 times y. So we have two factors here. We have a 7 and a y. And this constant factor here, this number 7 that is multiplying the variable, also has a special name."
Math,"It is called the coefficient of this term-- coefficient. And the coefficient is the nonvariable that multiplies the rest of the term. That's one way of thinking about it. So here's 7y. Even if it was 7xy or 7xyz or 7xyz squared, that nonvariable that's multiplying everything else, we would consider to be the coefficient. Now, let's do a few more examples. And in each of these-- I encourage you actually right now to pause the video-- think about what the terms are."
Math,"How many terms are there in each expression, how many factors in each term, and what are the coefficients? So let's look at this first one. It's clear that we have three things being added together. This is the first term. This is the second term. And this is the third term. So this is the first term. This is the second term. This is the third term. And they each have two factors. This first one has the factors 3 and x. The second one here has the factors x and y."
Math,"And this third one has the factors y and z. Now, what are the coefficients here? Well, remember, coefficients was a nonvariable multiplying a bunch of other variables. And so here, the coefficient in this first term right over here is a 3. Now, you might be saying, well, what about the coefficients on these terms right over here? Depending on how you think about it, one way to say it is, well, xy is the same thing as 1 times xy."
Math,"So some people would say that, hey, you have a coefficient of 1 here on the xy. Or it's implicitly there. It wasn't written, but you're multiplying everything by 1. And that might be subject to a little bit of interpretation one way or another. Now, this one is really interesting, because if we look at the bigger expression, if we look at the whole thing, it's clearly made up of three terms. The first term is xyz. The second term is x plus 1, that whole thing times y. And then the third term is 4x."
Math,"And if you look at that level, if you look at the first term, and you say, well, how many factors does that have? Well, you would say that it has three factors-- x, y, and z. How many factors does the second term have? Well, you could say, well, it has two factors. One factor is x plus y, and then the other factor is y. The first factor is x plus 1. And the second one is y. It's multiplying this expression. This smaller expression itself is one of the factors. And the other one is y."
Math,"And then this third one also has two factors, a 4 and an x. And if someone said, hey, what's the coefficient on this term? You would say, hey, look, the coefficient is the 4. Now, let's look at this one over here. Actually, before I look at that one, what was interesting about this is that here you had a little smaller expression itself acting as one of the factors. So then you can go and then zoom in on this expression right over here. And you can ask the same question."
Math,"On this smaller expression, how many terms does it have? Well, it has two terms-- an x and a 1. Those are the two things being added or subtracted. And each of them have exactly one factor. So when we're giving these, you can keep nesting these expressions to think about when you talk about terms or factors or factors of terms, you have to really specify what part of the nesting you're thinking about. If you're talking about the terms of this whole expression, there's one, two, three."
Math,"But then you could look at this subexpression, which itself is a factor of a term, and say, oh, well, there's only two terms in this one. Now, let's look at this one. How many terms? Well, once again, there's clearly three. Actually, let me add one more, because I'm tired of expressions with three terms. So I'm just going to add a 1 here. So now, we clearly have four terms. This is the first term, second term, third term, fourth term. And how many factors are in each of them? Well, this is interesting."
Math,"You might say, well, the factors are the things that are being multiplied. But here I'm dividing by y. Remember, dividing by y is the same thing as multiplying by its reciprocal. So it would usually be considered to have three factors here, where the factors are 3x and 1/y. If you multiplied 3 times x times 1/y, you're going to get exactly what you have right over here. So you would say this has three factors. If someone asks, what's the coefficient here? Well, you'd say, well, that 3 is the coefficient."
Math,"Here how many factors do you have? And this is a little bit tricky, because you might say, well, isn't 5x squared times y, isn't that equal to 5 times x times x times y? And you'd be right. So it would be very tempting to say that you have four factors. But the convention, the tradition that most people use, is that they consider the exponent with x as a base as just one factor, this as just one factor. So traditionally, people will say this has three factors. It has a 5x squared and a y."
Math,"x squared is just considered a factor. And once again, what's the coefficient? It's the 5. So with that in mind, how many factors here? Well, you have three factors here. You have an x. You have a y squared. And you have a z to the fifth. And then, finally, this last term, it's a constant term. How many factors does it have? Well, it's just 1. It's just got a 1 sitting there. It's not being multiplied by anything.."
Math,"And that problem is that it looks a lot like the multiplication symbol Or the one that we use in arithmetic So in arithmetic if I want to write 2 x 3 I literally write ""2 x 3"" But now that we are starting to use variables, if I want to write ""2 times x"" Well if I use this as the multiplication symbol it would be 2 times x And the times symbol and the X look awfully similar and if I'm not really careful with my penmanship it can get very confusing."
Math,"Is this ""Two x x""? Is this ""two times times something""? What exactly is going on here? And because this is confusing, This, right over here, is extremely confusing And it can be misinterpreted, We tend not to use this multiplication symbol When we are doing algebra Instead of that, to represent multiplication, We have several options. Instead of writing two times x this way, we could write 2 dot x."
Math,"And this dot, I want to be very clear, This is not a decimal This is just written a little bit higher And we write this so we don't get confusion in between this and one of these variables right here. But this can really be interpreted as ""2 times x"" So for example, if someone says 2 dot x, when x is equal to 3, well this would be the same thing as two times three, when x is equal to three. Another way you could write it is You could write ""2"" and then you could write the x in parentheses right next to it."
Math,"This is also interpreted as 2 times x Once again, so in this situation If ""x"" were seven, this would be two times seven, or fourteen And the most traditional way of doing it is to just write the x right after the 2. And sometimes this will be read as ""2x"" But this literally does mean ""Two times x"" And you might say, how come we didn't always do that? Well it would be literally confusing if we did it over here. Instead of writing ""2 times 3"" And wrote ""2 3"" Well, that looks like ""23""."
Math,"This doesn't look like two times three And this is why we never did it. But here, since we're using a letter now, It's clear that this isn't a part of that number. This isn't ""twenty something"" This is two times this variable x. So all of these are really the same expression. Two times x, two times x, and two times x."
Math,"And so with that out of the way Let's try some few worked examples, a few practice problems And this will hopefully prepare you for the next exercise Where you'll get a lot of chances to practice this. So if I where to say ""what is 10 minus three y"" And what does this equal when ""y"" is equal to two Well, every time you see the ""y"" You'd want that 2 there So this is y is equal to 2. Let's set that y equal to two This is the same thing as 10 minus three times two You do the multiplication first."
Math,"Multiplication takes precedence in order of operations So three times two is six, Ten minus six is equal to four. Let's do another one. Let's say we had ""7x minus 4"" And we want to evaluate that when when x is equal to three. Where we see the x, we want to put the 3 there So this is the same thing as ""7 times 3"" And I'll actually use this notation, so seven times three minus four."
Math,"And once again, multiplication takes precedence by order of operations, over addition or subtraction So we want to do the multiplying first 7 times 3 is 21 21 minus 4 is equal to 17. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of background, and I really encourage you to try the next exercise, It will give you a lot of practice on being to evaluate expressions like this.."
Math,"So let's first take the situation where t is equal to 1. Then this expression right over here becomes-- and I'll use that same color-- becomes 5 times 1. 5 times 1 plus 3. 5 times 1 plus 3, and we know from order of operations, you do the multiplication before you do the addition. So this will be 5 times 1 is 5 plus 3, and then this is clearly equal to 8. Now let's do it when t is equal to 8. So when t is equal to 8, this expression becomes-- and I'll do the same colors again-- 5 times 8 plus 3."
Math,"Same color of green. And once again, 5 times 8 is 40, and then we have the plus 3, there so this is equal to 43. And so we have the last situation, with t is equal to 10. I'll do that in blue. So we have 5 times 10. So 5t is 5 times 10. Instead of a t, put a 10 there. 5 times 10 plus 3. That's a slightly different shade of green, but I think you get the idea. 5 times 10 is 50. We do 50, and then we're going to have to add 3 to that, and that is equal to 53. And we're done.."
Math,"So this expression, for x equals two, would be five to the second power minus three to the second power. Well, what's that going to be equal to? Well, five to the second power, that's the same thing as five times five. And then from that, we are going to subtract three times three, three times three. And now order of operations would tell us to do the multiplication or do the exponents first, which is this multiplication. But just to make it clear, I'll put some parentheses here."
Math,"And this is going to be equal to, five times five is 25, which is equal to, what's 25 minus nine? It is equal to 16. So that's what that expression equals for x equals two. Let's do another example. So now we are asked what is the value of y squared minus x to the fourth when y is equal to nine and x equals two? So once again, pause this video, and see if you can evaluate that. All right, so here we have variables as the bases, as opposed to being the exponents, and we have two different variables."
Math,"But all we have to do is wherever we see a y, we substitute it with a nine. And wherever we see an x, we substitute it with a two. So y squared is going to be the same thing as nine squared minus, x, which is two. That minus looks a little bit funny, let me see. So this is gonna be nine squared minus x, which is two, two to the fourth power. Now what is this going to be equal to? Well, nine squared is nine times nine. So this whole thing is going to be equal to 81."
Math,"This whole thing right over here is nine times nine. Nine times nine is that right over there. And then from that, we're going to subtract two to the fourth power. Well, what's two to the fourth power? That is two times two, times two, times two. So this is going to be, two times two is four, four times two is eight, eight times two is 16. So it's 81 minus 16. Now what is that going to be equal to? Let's see, 81 minus six is 75, and then minus another 10 is going to be 65."
Math,"So there you have it, y squared minus x to the fourth, when y is equal to nine and x equals two, is equal to 65. And we're done.."
Math,"So this is going to be equivalent to five times, instead of x squared, it's going to be five times three squared. And we know from order of operations, we do the exponents first. That's why I actually put a parentheses around the three squared to just make that clear. And three squared is, of course, equal to nine and five times nine is equal to 45. Let's do another example that's a little bit different."
Math,"Let's say I have the expression 1/3 times six to the x power, and I want to evaluate it when x is equal to two. Pause the video again and see if you can work that out. Well, once again, everywhere where we see an x, we'll replace that with a two. So this is going to be the same thing as 1/3 times six squared. Where we saw the x, we now replace that with a two."
Math,"And so this is going to be equal to, we do the exponent first, order of operations, so it's going to be 1/3 times six squared is 36, and 1/3 of 36 is equal to 12. And we're done!."
Math,"So why don't you try to pause the video and evaluate this first before we work through it together. Alright, so if we want to evaluate this thing, everywhere we see a J we want to replace it with a 0.5 and everywhere we see a K we want to replace it with a 0.25, so let's do that. This is going to be seven times, and instead of J I'm gonna put a zero, a 0.5 in there. And then we have plus five minus eight times K. And K we're saying is 0.25."
Math,"So what is this going to be equal to? So if I were to take, if I were to take, and I can color code this, seven times 0.5. Half of 7, that's going to be three and a half, 3.5. Then I have plus five. And then I'm gonna subtract. I am subtracting eight times 0.25. 0.25, this is 1/4. I could rewrite this if I want. 0.25, that's the same thing as 1/4. Eight times 1/4, or another way to think about it is eight divided by four is gonna be equal to two. So this whole thing over here is going to be equal to two."
Math,"So it's gonna be minus, we have this minus out here, so minus two. And what is this going to be? Well, let's think about it. 3.5 plus five is 8.5, minus two is going to be 6.5. So this is equal to this, is equal to 6.5. Let's do another one of these. Alright. And we'll, just like before, try to work through it on your own before we do it together. Alright, now let's do it together. So over here I have this expression 0.1 M plus eight minus 12 N, when M is equal to 30 and N is equal to 1/4. Alright."
Math,"So everywhere I see an M I want to replace with a 30. And everywhere I see an N I want to replace with a 1/4. So this is going to be equal to 0.1 times M. M is 30. Times 30 plus eight minus 12 times N, where N is 1/4. N is 1/4. So what is, what is This right over here, 0.1, that's the same thing as 1/10 of 30? Well 1/10 of 30, that's going to be three. So this part is three. And we have three plus eight. And then we're gonna have minus."
Math,"Well what is 12 times 1/4? That's gonna be 12/4, or 12 divided by four, which is going to be equal to three. And now when we evaluate this, so that is equal to this, we have three plus eight minus three. Well, threes are going to, you know positive three, then you're gonna subtract three, and you're just going to be left with, you're just going to be left with an eight. And you're done. This expression when M is equal to 30 and N is equal to 1/4 is equal to eight.."
Math,"Pause the video before I try to have a go at it. Well, there's a couple of ways you could think about it. You say, ""Okay, I have 100 and I'm subtracting x."" So, as x increases, as x increases over here, I'm going to be subtracting larger and larger values. So, if I'm subtracting larger and larger values, I'm going to get smaller and smaller values. So, this whole thing, this whole thing is going to decrease."
Math,"This whole thing is going to decrease and if you wanna make it a little bit more concrete, you can actually try out some values there. So, you can make a little table here. X and then, what is 100 - x going to be? I'm just gonna pick some values of x. I'm gonna make them increase. Say, x is zero, x is 50, x is 100. Well, when an x is zero, 100 - x is 100 - zero. So, it's 100. When x is 50, it's going be 100 - 50, so it's going to be 50. When x is 100, it's 100 - 100, so it's zero."
Math,"So, it's pretty clear here that as x is increasing, as x is increasing, I'll just write incr. for increasing, we see that 100 - x is decreasing. We see that that is decreasing. Let's do this with a couple more expressions that have different forms. So, let's say that I have the expression. Let's say that I have the expression five over x plus five and x is decreasing, x is decreasing, but we also know that it is positive and even while it's decreasing, it's staying above zero."
Math,"So, we're saying x is staying greater than zero. So, in this case, so ya know, this could be a situation where x is decreasing from 10 to nine or a million to 100,000, but it's staying positive while it's decreasing. Let's think about that. We are going to be dividing by smaller and smaller positive values. So, as you have smaller and smaller positive values of the denominator, you're dividing by smaller and smaller positive values."
Math,"So, if you're dividing by smaller positive values, you're going to know that this thing is going to get larger. This entire expression is going to get larger as you divide by smaller and smaller positive values. So, if that expression gets larger, then you're just adding five to it. The whole thing is going to increase. The whole thing is going to increase as, the whole thing is going to increase as x decreases while staying positive. And once again, we can make a little table to take a look at that."
Math,"So, this is x, this is five over x plus five. Now, let's see. I'll just try out some. Let's see, I'll go from x 100 to x is five, to x is one. So, this is clearly x is decreasing. X is decreasing. When x is 100, you're gonna have five divided by 100, which would be five hundredths plus five, so it would be 5.05. When x is five, you're gonna have five divided by five, which is one plus five, which is six. When x is one, you're gonna have five divided by one, which is five plus five. You just, it's 10."
Math,"So notice, when x is staying positive, but decreasing, the whole expression, five over x plus five, this thing right over here is increasing. Let's do one more of these. So, let's say that we have the expression and we'll change up the variable here. 3y over 2y and I'm curious what happens to the value of this expression as y increases, as y increases."
Math,"Well, as you have larger y's here on the numerator, you're also going to have larger y's here in the denominator and one way you could think about this, this is the same thing as three halves times y over y. And no matter what y you have here, as long as it's not equal to zero and actually, let's just assume that it doesn't cross zero because at that point, at that point, this thing would become undefined. Let's just say that y increases and y is greater than zero just for simplicity."
Math,"So, y is a positive value here and actually, for any non-zero value, you take y, you divide by y, you're just gonna get one. So, it doesn't matter what y is. Y could be a million over a million. This thing is just gonna be one. Y could be five over five, it's still just going to be one. The value of the expression is not going to change. It's just going to be three halves. So, the expression is just going to be the same."
Math,"You're not going to have any change as y increases, as y is positive and it increases.."
Math,"So let's do that. So we'll get F is equal to 9/5-- now for C, we're going to put in 25-- times 25 plus 32. And now we can simplify this before we multiply 25 times 9. Remember, this is the same thing as 9/5 times 25/1. We can essentially divide the numerator and the denominator of our eventual product by 5. If we divide 25 by 5, we get 5. If we divide 5 by 5, we get 1. So this boils down to 9 times 5 plus 32. So our Fahrenheit degrees are going to be 9 times 5 is 45 plus 32 degrees."
Math,"Or it's equal to 45 plus 32 is 77, so this is 77 degrees Fahrenheit.."
Math,"So if that's the cube, we can see three sides. Three sides are facing us. But then if it was transparent, we see that there are actually six sides of a cube. So there's this one-- one, two, three in front-- and then one-- this is the bottom. This is in the back, and this is also in the back. So you have three sides of the cube. So I believe what they're saying. The surface area of a cube with side length x-- so if this is x, if this is x, if this is x-- is given by the expression 6x squared."
Math,"That also makes sense. The area of each side is going to be x times x is x squared, and there's six of them. So it's going to be 6x squared. Jolene has two cube-shaped containers that she wants to paint. One cube has side length 2. So this is one cube right over here. I'll do my best to draw it. So this right over here has side length 2, so that's its dimensions. The other cube has side length 1.5. So the other cube is going to be a little bit smaller. It has side length 1.5. So it's 1.5 by 1.5 by 1.5."
Math,"What is the total surface area that she has to paint? Well, we know that the surface area of each cube is going to be 6x squared, where x is the dimensions of that cube. So the surface area of this cube right over here is going to be 6. And now-- let me do it in that color of that cube-- it's going to be 6 times x, where x is the dimension of the cube. And then the cube all has the same dimensions, so its length, width, and depth is all the same."
Math,"So for this cube, the surface area is going to be 6 times 2 squared. And then the surface area of this cube is going to be 6 times 1.5 squared. And if we want the total surface area she has to paint, it's going to be the sum of the two cubes. So we're just going to add these two things. And so if we were to compute this first one right over here, this is going to be 6 times 4. This is 24. And this one right over here, this is going to be a little bit hairier. Let's see. 15 times 15 is 225."
Math,"So 1.5 times 1.5 is 2.25. So 1.5 squared is 2.25. And 2.25 times 6-- so let me just multiply that out. 2.25 times 6. Let's see. We're going to have 6 times 5 is 30. 6 times 2 is 12, plus 3 is 15. 6 times 2 is 12, plus 1 is 13. I have two numbers behind the decimal-- 13.5. So it's going to be 13.5. And if I add these two together, this is going to be equal to the total surface area that she has got to paint, is going to be 37.5 square-- well, I guess they're not giving us the units."
Math,"Well, 37.5 is going to be the total area of square units of whatever the units happen to be.."
Math,"All I did is every time we saw a y here, I put a 3 there. Every time we saw a y, I put a 3. So what does this evaluate to? And we have to remember our order of operations. Remember, parentheses comes first. Sometimes it's referred to as PEMDAS. Let me write that down. PEMDAS, PEMDAS. P is for parentheses. E is for exponents. M and D are for Multiplication and Division. They're really at the same level of priority. And then addition and subtraction are at the same level."
Math,"If you really want to do it properly, it should be P-E, and then multiplication and division are really at the same level. And addition and subtraction are at the same level. But what this tells us is that we do parentheses first. But then after that, exponentiation takes priority over everything else here. So we have to evaluate these exponents before we multiply anything or before we subtract anything. So the one exponent we'd have to evaluate is 3 squared. So let's remember. 3 to the first is just 3."
Math,"It's just 3 times itself once. So it's just 3. 3 squared is equal to 3 times 3, 3 multiplied by itself twice. That's equal to 9. 3 to the third power is equal to 3 times 3 times 3. Or you could view it as 3 squared times 3. So it'll be 9. 3 times 3 is 9. 9 times 3 is equal to 27. 3 to the fourth is equal to 3 times 3 times 3 times 3. So 3 times 3 is 9. 3 times 3 is 9. So it's going to be the same thing as 9 times 9. So this is going to be equal to 81. So we now know what 3 to the fourth is."
Math,"We know what 3 squared is. Let's just put it in the expression. So this is going to be equal to 5 times 3 to the fourth. 3 to the fourth is 81. So 5 times 81 minus 3 squared. And we have 3 squared right over here. It is equal to 9. 5 times 81 minus 9. Let's figure out what 5 times 81 is. So 81 times 5. 1 times 5 is 5. 8 times 5 is 40. So this right over here is 405. So it becomes 405 minus 9. So that is going to be equal to-- if we were subtracting 10, it would be 395."
Math,But we're subtracting one less than that. So it's 396. And we're done..
Math,"You could also write that as 11 plus a. Both of them would be 11 more than a. So let's check our answer here. We got it right. Let's do a few more of these. ""Write an expression to represent the sum of d and 9."" So the sum of d and 9, that means you're gonna add d and 9. So I could write that as d plus 9 or I could write that as 9 plus d. And check our answer. Got that right. Let's do a few more of these."
Math,"""Write an expression to represent j minus 15."" Well, I could just write it with math symbols instead of writing the word minus. Instead of writing M-I-N-U-S, I could write j minus 15. And then I check my answer. Got it right. Let's do a few more of these. This is a lot of fun. ""Write an expression to represent 7 times r."" There's a couple ways I could do it. I could use this little dot right over here, do 7 times r like that. That would be correct. I could literally just write 7r."
Math,"If I just wrote 7r that would also count. Let me check my answer. That's right. Let me do a couple of other of these just so you can see that I could've just done 10 and this is not a decimal, it sits a little bit higher than a decimal. It's multiplication and the reason why once you start doing algebra, you use this symbol instead of that kind of cross for multiplication is that x-looking thing gets confused with x when you're using x as a variable so that's why this is a lot more useful."
Math,"So we wanna write 10 times u, 10 times u, let's check our answer. We got it right. Let's do one more. ""Write an expression to represent 8 divided by d."" So we could write it as 8 and then I could write a slash like that, 8 divided by d. And there you go. This is 8 divided by d. Let me check, let me check the answer. I'll do one more of these. Oh, it's 6 divided by b. Alright, same thing. So 6, I could use this tool right over here. It does the same thing as if I were to press the backslash."
Math,So 6 divided by b. Check my answer. We got it right..
Math,"So my brain thinks, all right, let me start with x, and how am I going to get two less than that? Well, I'm going to subtract two. And this is an interesting example because you see the order that we see it in the sentence is not the order that we would necessarily write it in the expression right over here. Very important to think about, what is going on here? What is being described? Now, this next statement, y fewer than three."
Math,"Well, in my mind, I'm going to start with three and I'm going to be y fewer than that. So I'm gonna start with three and then I'm going to be y fewer than that. Now, these first two statements are similar in that you have something less than something else or something fewer than something else. They just swapped the number and the variable. Now, this third statement, x decreased by five. So my mind is thinking, what am I starting with? I'm starting with an x and I'm decreasing it by five."
Math,"So I can do that as minus five, or I'm gonna take five away from it.."
Math,"So the quantity 8 times x, well, that's just 8x. So I can just write 8x over there. So it is negative 7 plus 8x. Or you could view this as the sum of negative 7 and the quantity 8 times x. Let's do the next one. Take the quantity negative 3 times x and then add 1. So the quantity negative 3 times x, we can write that as negative 3x. And then we need to add 1 to that. So that's going to be plus 1. Now this one. Negative 6 plus-- so we can write negative 6 plus something-- the product of negative 1 and x."
Math,"So the product of negative 1 and x, that's just going to be negative 1x, which is the same thing as negative x. So we can write this as negative 6 plus negative x. Or we can just write this-- this is the exact same thing as negative 6 minus x. And we are done.."
Math,"So let me just write a five, times and I'll write a dot because when we're dealing with algebra, if you write a traditional multiplication sign, it can get confused with an X. So five times the difference of X and two. The difference of X and two, we could write as X minus two, but this expression has a problem because whoever's interpreting it, if they're following order of operations, which they should, that would mean that they would multiply the five and the X first and then subtract two."
Math,"But that's not what's going on in the sentence. It's five times, not X, but the difference of X and two. So what you need to do is put parentheses here to make sure that you take the difference of X and two first, and then multiply that by five. Now, with that in mind, let's tackle this example right over here, 10 times the sum of Y and three. Well, once again, if you just wrote 10 times the sum of Y and three, you'll run into the same problem."
Math,"someone would interpret this as, hey, maybe I should multiply 10 and Y first, because that's what order of operations would tell me to do, but that's not what we want. We want 10 times, not just Y, but the sum of Y and three. So that's where the parentheses are really important to make sure that we take the sum of Y and three first and then multiply that by 10.."
Math,"First, we're going to have this expression-- negative 5 plus something. So it's going to be negative 5 plus the quantity of 4 times x. Well, that's just going to be 4x. So it's going to be negative 5 plus 4x. So that's this expression up here. Now, take the product of negative 8, so were going to just take negative 8, and we're going to multiply the product of negative 8 and that expression. So we're going to take negative 8 and multiply it so that expression is this thing right over here."
Math,"So if we say the product of negative 8 in that expression is going to be negative 8 times that expression, that expression is negative 5 plus 4x, so that's negative 8. That's that expression. The product of the two, so we could put a multiplication sign there, or we could just leave that out and implicitly it would mean multiplication, take the product of negative 8 and that expression and then add 6. So that would be then adding 6 right over here."
Math,"So we could write it as negative 8 open parentheses negative 5 plus 4x and then add 6. Let's do one more. First, consider the expression the sum of 7 and-- so that's going to be 7 plus something-- and the product of negative 2 and x. The product of negative 2 and x is negative 2x. So it's 7 plus negative 2x. We could write that as 7 minus 2x. So this is equal to 7 minus 2x. These are the same expression."
Math,"What expression would be 4 plus? So now we're saying 4 plus the quantity of 2 times that expression? So it's going to be 4 plus some quantity. I'll put that in parentheses. The quantity of 2 times-- I'll do this in magenta or in yellow. 2 times that expression-- let me do this in blue-- that expression is this thing right over here. So 4 plus the quantity of 2 times that expression, 2 times 7 minus 2x. And we are done.."
Math,"How long was the race? Write your answer as an expression. Alright, if we're trying to figure out the number of miles, you'd want to take her speed, which is in miles per hour, so five miles per hour times the number of hours. So the number of hours is t, so you can literally just write that as five t. Five t literally means five times t. Now another way you could have done it is you could have used this little dot symbol here."
Math,"This is not a decimal, it sits higher than a decimal, and it means multiplication, five times t, either of these, five dot t or five t means five times t, it makes sense. You take your speed times your time, and you'll figure out how far you actually went. Let me check my answer here. Let's do a few more of these. The Running Aces card team won $548 playing poker in tournaments last year. The winnings were split evenly among the p players."
Math,"How much of money did each, I guess you'd say how much money, not how much of money, it's a grammatical error. How much money did each player receive? Write your answer as an expression. So they had $548, and they had to split it evenly among the p players, so they're gonna split it, so I'm just gonna go backslash here, or I literally could have just clicked on this as well, 548 divided by p. I'm gonna divide the amount of money we got amongst the number of players."
Math,"So that's how much money each player actually receives. Let's check the answer, we've got it right. Let's do a few more of these. Phil received a prize of x dollars from a poker tournament. The tournament cost him $100 to enter. What were Phil's net winnings from the tournament? Write your answer as an expression. Alright, his net winnings, okay. He gets x dollars, but it's not like he just walks away with x, I means, he does get the x dollars, but he had to pay something to enter the tournament."
Math,"He had to pay $100 to enter the tournament, so for example, if x was $105, he wins $105, but if he had to spend $100 to enter the tournament, then his net would be 105 minus 100, or five dollars, so this is giving us the net. We're getting how much he got, but we're subtracting how much he actually had to spend. Let's do one more of these. Hillary made 48 chocolate chip cookies and y sugar cookies."
Math,"How many total cookies did Hillary make? Well, 48 chocolate chip cookies, and then you add that, the number of sugar cookies she made, and there you have it. That's the total number of cookies she made. If she made two sugar cookies, y would be two, and she would've made a total of 50 cookies. If she made 100 sugar cookies, then this would be 100 plus 48 which would be 148 total cookies."
Math,"So hopefully that gives you a little bit of practice, and I encourage you to do this exercise so you get a lot more practice.."
Math,It's 1 times 36. So the smallest number that is both a multiple of 36 and 12-- because 36 is a multiple of 12-- is actually 36. There we go. Let's do a couple more of these. That one was too easy. What is the least common multiple of 18 and 12? And they just state this with a different notation. The least common multiple of 18 and 12 is equal to question mark. So let's think about this a little bit. So there's a couple of ways you can think about-- so let's just write down our numbers that we care about.
Math,"We care about 18, and we care about 12. So there's two ways that we could approach this. One is the prime factorization approach. We can take the prime factorization of both of these numbers and then construct the smallest number whose prime factorization has all of the ingredients of both of these numbers, and that will be the least common multiple. So let's do that. 18 is 2 times 9, which is the same thing as 2 times 3 times 3, or 18 is 2 times 9. 9 is 3 times 3."
Math,"So we could write 18 is equal to 2 times 3 times 3. That's its prime factorization. 12 is 2 times 6. 6 is 2 times 3. So 12 is equal to 2 times 2 times 3. Now, the least common multiple of 18 and 12-- let me write this down-- so the least common multiple of 18 and 12 is going to have to have enough prime factors to cover both of these numbers and no more, because we want the least common multiple or the smallest common multiple. So let's think about it."
Math,"Well, it needs to have at least 1, 2, a 3 and a 3 in order to be divisible by 18. So let's write that down. So we have to have a 2 times 3 times 3. This makes it divisible by 18. If you multiply this out, you actually get 18. And now let's look at the 12. So this part right over here-- let me make it clear. This part right over here is the part that makes up 18, makes it divisible by 18. And then let's see. 12, we need two 2's and a 3. Well, we already have one 3, so our 3 is taken care of."
Math,"We have one 2, so this 2 is taken care of. But we don't have two 2s's. So we need another 2 here. So, notice, now this number right over here has a 2 times 2 times 3 in it, or it has a 12 in it, and it has a 2 times 3 times 3, or an 18 in it. So this right over here is the least common multiple of 18 and 12. If we multiply it out, so 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 3 is 12. 12 times 3 is equal to 36. And we are done."
Math,"Now, the other way you could've done it is what I would say just the brute force method of just looking at the multiples of these numbers. You would say, well, let's see. The multiples of 18 are 18, 36, and I could keep going higher and higher, 54. And I could keep going. And the multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36. And immediately I say, well, I don't have to go any further. I already found a multiple of both, and this is the smallest multiple of both. It is 36."
Math,"You might say, hey, why would I ever do this one right over here as opposed to this one? A couple of reasons. This one, you're kind of-- it's fun, because you're actually decomposing the number and then building it back up. And also, this is a better way, especially if you're doing it with really, really large and hairy numbers."
Math,"Really, really, really large and hairy numbers where you keep trying to find all the multiples, you might have to go pretty far to actually figure out what their least common multiple is. Here, you'll be able to do it a little bit more systematically, and you'll know what you're doing.."
Math,"And I'm going to do this using the prime factorization method which I just like more. Let's find the prime factorization of both of these numbers. So 30, it's divisible by 2. It's 2 times 15. 15 is 3 times 5. And now we've expressed 30 as the product of only prime numbers, 2 times 3 times 5. Now let's do the same thing for 25. 25 is-- well that's just 5 times 5. So let me write that down. 25 is equal to 5 times 5."
Math,"Now to find the least common multiple, let me write this down, the least common multiple of 30 and 25 is going to have a number whose prime factorization is a super set of both of these or has all of these numbers in them as many times as we have in any one of these. So it's the least common multiple. Well it has to be divisible by 30. So it's going to need a 2 times a 3 times a 5. This is what makes it divisible by 30. But it needs to also be divisible by 25."
Math,"And in order to be divisible by 25, you need to have two 5s in your prime factorization. Right now our prime factorization only has one 5. So let's throw. So we have one 5 right over here. We need another 5. So let's throw another 5 right over here. So now this thing clearly has a 25 in it. It's clearly divisible by 25. And this is the least common multiple."
Math,"I could have, if we just wanted a common multiple, we could have thrown more factors here and it would have definitely been divisible by 30 or 25, but this has the bare minimum of prime factors necessary to be divisible by 30 and 25. If I got rid of any one of these, I wouldn't be divisible by both anymore. If I got rid of this 2, I wouldn't be divisible by 30 anymore. If I got rid of one of the 5s, I wouldn't be divisible by 25 anymore. So let's just multiply it out."
Math,"This is essentially the prime factorization of our least common multiple. And this is equal to 2 times 3 is 6, 6 times 5 is 30, 30 times 5 is equal to 150. And of course, we can check our answer, 150. Check it, and we got it right.."
Math,"But let's actually work through this problem. So to do that, let's just think about the different multiples of the 15, 6, and 10 and then find at the smallest multiple, the least multiple, they have in common. So let's find the multiples of 15. So you have 1 times 15 is 15. 2 times 15 is 30. Then if you add 15 again, you get 45. You add 15 again, you get 60. You add 15 again, you get 75. You add 15 again, you get 90. You add 15 again, you get 105."
Math,"And if still none of these are common multiples with these guys over here, then we might have to go further. But I'll stop there for now. So that's the multiples of 15 up through 105. Obviously, we can keep going from there. Now, let's do the multiples of 6. 1 times 6 is 6. 2 times 6 is 12. 3 times 6 is 18. 4 times 6 is 24. 5 times 6 is 30. 6 times 6 is 36. 7 times 6 is 42. 8 times 6 is 48. 9 times 6 is 54. 10 times 6 is 60."
Math,"60 already looks interesting, because it is a common multiple of both 15 and 60, although we have two of them over here. We have a 30, and we have a 30. We have a 60 and a 60. So the smallest common multiple, so if we only cared about the least common multiple of 15 and 6, we would say it's 30. So let me write this down as an intermediate. The LCM of 15 and 6, so the least common multiple, the smallest multiple that they have in common, we see over here. 15 times 2 is 30. And 6 times 5 is 30."
Math,"So this is definitely a common multiple. And it's the smallest of all of their common multiples. 60 is also a common multiple. But it's a bigger one. This is the least common multiple. So this is 30. Well, we haven't thought about the 10 yet. So let's bring the 10 in there. And I think you already see where this is going. Let's do the multiples of 10. They are 10, 20, 30, 40. Well, we already went far enough, because we already got to 30. And 30 is a common multiple of 15 and 6."
Math,"And it's the smallest common multiple of all of them. So it's actually the fact that the LCM of 15, 6, and 10 is equal to 30. Now, this is one way to find the least common multiple. Literally just look at the multiples of each of the number and then see what the smallest multiple they have is in common. Another way to do that is to look at the prime factorization of each of these numbers."
Math,And the least common multiple is the number that has all of the elements of the prime factorizations of these and nothing else. So let me show you what I mean by that. So you could do it this way. Or you could say 15 is the same thing as 3 times 5. And that's it. That's its prime factorization. 15 is 3 times 5. Both 3 and 5 are prime. We can say that 6 is the same thing as 2 times 3. That's it. That's its prime factorization. Both 2 and 3 are prime.
Math,"And then we can say that 10 is the same thing as 2 times 5. Both 2 and 5 are prime. So we're done factoring it. And so the least common multiple of 15, 6, and 10 just needs to have all of these prime factors. And what I mean, to be clear, is in order to be divisible by 15, it has to have at least one 3 and one 5 in its prime factorization. So it has to have at least one 3 and at least one 5. By having a 3 times 5 in its prime factorization, that ensures that this number is divisible by 15."
Math,"To be divisible by 6, it has to have at least one 2 and one 3. So it has to have at least one 2. And we already have a 3 over here. So that's all we want. We just need one 3. So one 2 and one 3, this 2 times 3, ensures that we are divisible by 6. And let me make it clear. This right here is the 15. And then to make sure that we're divisible by 10, we have to have at least one 2 and one 5. These two over here make sure that we are divisible by 10. And so we have all of them."
Math,"This 2 times 3 times 5 has all of the prime factors of either 10, 6, or 15. So it is the least common multiple. And so if you multiply this out, you will get 2 times 3 is 6. 6 times 5 is 30. So either way, hopefully, both of these resonate with you. And you see why they make sense. This second way is a little bit better if you're trying to do it for really complex numbers, numbers where you might have to be multiplying it for a long time."
Math,"Either way, both of these are valid ways of finding the least common multiple.."
Math,"So the largest number that is a-- I guess you could say-- factor of both 20 and 40 is actually 20. 20 is 20 times 1, and 40 is 20 times 2. So in this situation, we don't even have to break out our paper. We can just write 20. Let's do a couple more of these. So we're asked, what is the greatest common divisor of 10 and 7? So let's now break out our paper for this. So our greatest common divisor of 10 and 7. So let me write that down. So we have 10."
Math,"We want to think about what is our GCD of 10 and 7? And there's two ways that you can approach this. One way, you could literally list all of the factors-- not prime factors, just regular factors-- of each of these numbers and figure out which one is greater or what is the largest factor of both. So, for example, you could say, well, I got a 10, and 10 can be expressed 1 times 10 or 2 times 5. 1, 2, 5, and 10. These are all factors of 10. These are all, we could say, divisors of 10."
Math,"And sometimes this is called greatest common factor. Seven-- what are all of its factors? Well, 7 is prime. It only has two factors-- 1 and itself. So what is the greatest common factor? Well, there's only one common factor here, 1. 1 is the only common factor. So the greatest common factor of 10 and 7, or the greatest common divisor, is going to be equal to 1. So let's write that down. Let's do one more. What is the greatest common divisor of 21 and 30? And this is just another way of saying that."
Math,"So 21 and 30 are the two numbers that we care about. So we want to figure out the greatest common divisor, and I could have written greatest common factor, of 21 and 30. So once again, there's two ways of doing this. And so there's the way I did the last time where I literally list all the factors. Let me do it that way really fast. So if I say 21, what are all the factors? Well, it's 1 and 21, and 3, and 7. I think I've got all of them."
Math,"And 30 can be written as 1 and 30, 2 and 15, and 3-- actually, I'm going to run out of them. Let me write it this way so I get a little more space. So 1 and 30. 2 and 15. 3 and 10. And 5 and 6. So here are all of the factors of 30. And now what are the common factors? Well, 1 is a common factor. 3 is also a common factor. But what is the greatest common factor or the greatest common divisor? Well, it is going to be 3. So we could write 3 here. Now, I keep talking about another technique."
Math,"Let me show you the other technique, and that involves the prime factorization. So if you say the prime factorization of 21-- well, let's see, it's divisible by 3. It is 3 times 7. And the prime factorization of 30 is equal to 3 times 10, and 10 is 2 times 5. So what are the most factors that we can take from both 21 and 30 to make the largest possible numbers? So when you look at the prime factorization, the only thing that's common right over here is a 3."
Math,"And so we would say that the greatest common factor or the greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3. If you saw nothing in common right over here, then you say the greatest common divisor is one. Let me give you another interesting example, just so that we can get a sense of things. So let's say these two numbers were not 21 and 30, but let's say we care about the greatest common divisor not of 21, but let's say of 105 and 30."
Math,"So if we did the prime factorization method, it might become a little clearer now. Actually figuring out, hey, what are all the factors of 105 might be a little bit of a pain, but if you do a prime factorization, you'd say, well, let's see, 105-- it's divisible by 5, definitely. So it's 5 times 21, and 21 is 3 times 7. So the prime factorization of 105 is equal to-- if I write them in increasing order-- 3 times 5 times 7."
Math,"The prime factorization of 30, we already figured out is 30 is equal to 2 times 3 times 5. So what's the most number of factors or prime factors that they have in common? Well, these two both have a 3, and they both have a 5. So the greatest common factor or greatest common divisor is going to be a product of these two. In this situation, the GCD of 105 and 30 is 3 times 5, is equal to 15. So you could do it either way."
Math,"You could just list out the traditional divisors or factors and, say, figure out which of those is common and is the greatest. Or you can break it down into its core constituencies, its prime factors, and then figure out what is the largest set of common prime factors, and the product of those is going to be your greatest common factor. It's the largest number that is divisible into both numbers.."
Math,"They're asking you the same thing. I mean, really a divisor is just a number that can divide into something, and a factor-- well, I think, that's also a number that can divide into something. So a divisor and a factor are kind of the same thing. So with that out of the way, let's figure out, what is the greatest common divisor or the greatest common factor of 12 and 8? Well, what we do is, it's pretty straightforward. First we just figure out the factors of each of the numbers."
Math,"So first let's write all of the factors out of the number 12. Well, 1 is a factor, 2 goes into 12. 3 goes into 12. 4 goes into 12. 5 does not to go into 12. 6 goes into 12 because 2 times 6. And then, 12 goes into 12 of course. 1 times 12. So that's the factors of 12. Let's write the factors of 8. Well, 1 goes into 8. 2 goes into 8. 3 does not go into 8. 4 does go into 8. And then the last factor, pairing up with the 1 is 8. So now we've written all the factors of 12 and 8."
Math,"So let's figure out what the common factors of 12 and 8 are. Well, they both have the common factor of 1. And that's really not so special. Pretty much every whole number or every integer has the common factor of 1. They both share the common factor 2 and they both share the common factor 4. So we're not just interested in finding a common factor, we're interested in finding the greatest common factor. So all the common factors are 1, 2 and 4. And what's the greatest of them? Well, that's pretty easy."
Math,"It's 4. So the greatest common factor of 12 and 8 is 4. Let me write that down just for emphasis. Greatest common factor of 12 and 8 equals 4. And of course, we could have just as easily had said, the greatest common divisor of 12 and 8 equals 4. Sometimes it does things a little funny. Let's do another problem. What is the greatest common divisor of 25 and 20? Well, let's do it the same way. The factors of 25? Well, it's 1. 2 doesn't go into it. 3 doesn't go into it. 4 doesn't go into it. 5 does."
Math,"It's actually 5 times 5. And then 25. It's interesting that this only has 3 factors. I'll leave you to think about why this number only has 3 factors and other numbers tend to have an even number of factors. And then now we do the factors of 20. Factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. And if we just look at this by inspection we see, well, they both share 1, but that's nothing special. But they both have the common factor of? You got it-- 5."
Math,"So the greatest common divisor or greatest common factor of 25 and 20- well, that equals 5. Let's do another problem. What is the greatest common factor of 5 and 12? Well, factors of 5? Pretty easy. 1 and 5. That's because it's a prime number. It has no factors other than 1 and itself. Then the factors of 12? 12 has a lot of factors. It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. So it really looks like only common factor they share is 1. So that was, I guess, in some ways kind of disappointing."
Math,"So the greatest common factor of 5 and 12 is 1. And I'll throw out some terminology here for you. When two numbers have a greatest common factor of only 1, they're called relatively prime. And that kind of makes sense because a prime number is something that only has 1 and itself as a factor. And two relatively prime numbers are numbers that only have 1 as their greatest common factor. Hope I didn't confuse you. Let's do another problem. Let's do the greatest common divisor of 6 and 12."
Math,"I know 12's coming up a lot. I'll try to be more creative when I think of my numbers. Well, the greatest common divisor of 6 and 12? Well, it's the factors of 6. Are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3-- we should have these memorized by now. 3, 4, 6, and 12. Well, it turns out 1 is a common factor of both. 2 is also a common factor of both. 3 is a common factor of both. And 6 is a common factor of both. And of course, what's the greatest common factor? Well, it's 6. And that's interesting."
Math,"So in this situation the greatest common divisor-- and I apologize that I keep switching between divisor and factor. The mathematics community should settle on one of the two. The greatest common divisor of 6 and 12 equals 6. So it actually equals one of the numbers. And that makes a lot of sense because 6 actually is divisible into 12. Well, that's it for now. Hopefully you're ready to do the greatest common divisor or factor problems."
Math,I think I might make another module in the near future that'll give you more example problems..
Math,"Well I could write 35 as, let's see, I could write that as five times seven, and I could write 50 as five times ten, and so we see five is the greatest common factor. Seven and ten don't have any factors in common. So I could rewrite this, I could write 35 as equal to five times seven and I could rewrite 50 as equal to, get another color here, I could rewrite 50 as five times ten, and of course, I'm adding them, so I have plus right over here."
Math,"If I want, I could put parentheses, but order of operations would make me do the multiplication first, anyway. But now I want to factor out that greatest common factor. I want to factor out the five. So what I'm really doing right over here is I'm unwinding the distributive property. So if I factor out a five, this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to let's factor out the five. Five times, so you do 35 divided by five, you're just left with the seven."
Math,"You're just left with the seven over here. So you're just left with the seven after you've factored out the five, and over here, you're just left with the ten. So five, or seven plus ten, and we're done. 35 plus 50 is equal to five times seven plus ten. So let me now go and type that in. So this is the same thing as five, five times seven plus ten. And you know you've factored out the greatest common factor because seven and ten don't have any factors in common anymore. They're called relatively prime."
Math,"They have no factors in common other than one. So we could now check that. Let's do a couple more of these. Apply the distributive property to factor out the greatest common factor. So let's see if we can just do this one a little bit faster. So let's see, the largest number it's divisible, in both 75 and 20, I don't know, let me try five. So if I say five times, so 75 divided by five, let's see is going to be, it's going to be 15. Is that right? Yeah, cause five times ten is 50, five times five is 25."
Math,"Yeah, so it's 15, and I got that 15 by dividing 75 by five. So 15 plus, and then 20 divided by five would be, 20 divided by five would be four. 15 plus four. Let's see, did I do this right? 15 and four don't have any factors in common, and if I were to apply the distributive property here, I'd have five times 15 is 75. Five times four is 20. Yeah, I'm feeling good about that. We got it right.."
Math,"So we have 4 times 8 plus 8 plus 3. Now there's two ways to do it. Normally, when you have parentheses, your inclination is, well, let me just evaluate what's in the parentheses first and then worry about what's outside of the parentheses, and we can do that fairly easily here. We can evaluate what 8 plus 3 is. 8 plus 3 is 11. So if we do that-- let me do that in this direction. So if we do that, we get 4 times, and in parentheses we have an 11."
Math,"8 plus 3 is 11, and then this is going to be equal to-- well, 4 times 11 is just 44, so you can evaluate it that way. But they want us to use the distributive law of multiplication. We did not use the distributive law just now. We just evaluated the expression. We used the parentheses first, then multiplied by 4. In the distributive law, we multiply by 4 first. And it's called the distributive law because you distribute the 4, and we're going to think about what that means."
Math,"So in the distributive law, what this will become, it'll become 4 times 8 plus 4 times 3, and we're going to think about why that is in a second. So this is going to be equal to 4 times 8 plus 4 times 3. A lot of people's first instinct is just to multiply the 4 times the 8, but no! You have to distribute the 4. You have to multiply it times the 8 and times the 3. This is right here. This is the distributive property in action right here. Distributive property in action."
Math,"And then when you evaluate it-- and I'm going to show you in kind of a visual way why this works. But then when you evaluate it, 4 times 8-- I'll do this in a different color-- 4 times 8 is 32, and then so we have 32 plus 4 times 3. 4 times 3 is 12 and 32 plus 12 is equal to 44. That is also equal to 44, so you can get it either way. But when they want us to use the distributive law, you'd distribute the 4 first. Now let's think about why that happens. Let's visualize just what 8 plus 3 is."
Math,"Let me draw eight of something. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, right? And then we're going to add to that three of something, of maybe the same thing. One, two, three. So you can imagine this is what we have inside of the parentheses. We have 8 circles plus 3 circles. Now, when we're multiplying this whole thing, this whole thing times 4, what does that mean? Well, that means we're just going to add this to itself four times. Let me do that with a copy and paste. Copy and paste."
Math,"Let me copy and then let me paste. There you go. That's two. That's one, two, three, and then we have four, and we're going to add them all together. So this is literally what? Four times, right? Let me go back to the drawing tool. We have it one, two, three, four times this expression, which is 8 plus 3. Now, what is this thing over here? If you were to count all of this stuff, you would get 44. But what is this thing over here? Well, that's 8 added to itself four times."
Math,"You could imagine you're adding all of these. So what's 8 added to itself four times? That is 4 times 8. So this is 4 times 8, and what is this over here in the orange? We have one, two, three, four times. Well, each time we have three. So it's 4 times this right here. This right here is 4 times 3. So you see why the distributive property works."
Math,"If you do 4 times 8 plus 3, you have to multiply-- when you, I guess you could imagine, duplicate the thing four times, both the 8 and the 3 is getting duplicated four times or it's being added to itself four times, and that's why we distribute the 4.."
Math,"This is going to be 5 times 9 minus 4, just like that. Now, if we want to use the distributive property, well, you don't have to. You could just evaluate 9 minus 4 and then multiply that times 5. But if you want to use the distributive property, you distribute the 5. You multiply the 5 times the 9 and the 4, so you end up with 5 times 9 minus 5 times 4. Notice, we distributed the 5. We multiplied it times both the 9 and the 4."
Math,"In the first distributive property video, we gave you an idea of why you have to distribute the 5, why it makes sense, why you don't just multiply it by the 9. And we're going to verify that it gives us the same answer as if we just evaluated the 9 minus 4 first. But anyway, what are these things? So 5 times 9, that is 45. So we have 45 minus-- what's 5 times 4? Well, that's 20. 45 minus 20, and that is equal to 25, so this is using the distributive property right here."
Math,"If we didn't want to use the distributive property, if we just wanted to evaluate what's in the parentheses first, we would have gotten-- let's go in this direction-- 5 times-- what's 9 minus 4? 9 minus 4 is 5. Let me do that in a different color. 5 times 9 minus 4. So it's 5 times 5. 5 times 5 is just 25, so we get the same answer either way. This is using the distributive law of multiplication over subtraction, usually just referred to as the distributive property."
Math,This is evaluating the inside of the parentheses first and then multiplying by 5..
Math,"I have it right over here. 1/2(2a-6b+8). So, lemme just rewrite it. So, I'm gonna take, and lemme color code it, too, just for fun, so it's going to be 1/2 times, give myself some space, 1/2(2a-6b), so, 2a-6b, minus six, lemme write it this way - 6b, and then we have plus eight. Plus, and I will do eight in this color. And so, i just need to distribute the 1/2. If I multiplying 1/2 times this entire expression, that means I multiply 1/2 times each of these terms."
Math,"So, I'm gonna multiply 1/2 times this, 1/2 times this, and 1/2 times that. So, 1/2 times 2a, so this is going to be 1/2 times 2a, times, lemme do it in that same color so you see where the 2a came from. 1/2(2a) minus, minus 1/2(6b). Minus 1/2(6b). Times 6b+1/2(8). 1/2(8). And so, what's this going to be? Well, let's see, I have 1/2(2a). 1/2(2) is just one, so you're just going to be left with A. And then you have minus 1/2(6b). Well, we could just think about what 1/2(6) is going to be."
Math,"1/2(6) is going to be three, and then you still are multiplying times B. So, it's gonna be 3b. And then we have plus 1/2(8). Half of eight is four. Or as you can say, eight halves is equal to four wholes. Alright, so this is going to be four. So, it's a-3b+4, a-3b+4. So, let's type that in. It's going to be a-3b+4. And notice, it's just literally half of each of these terms."
Math,"Half of 2a is A, half of 6b is 3b, so we have minus 6b, so it's gonna be minus 3b, and then plus eight, instead of that, half of that plus four. So, let's check our answer. And we got it right. Let's do another one of these. So, let's say, so, they say apply the distributive property to factor out the greatest common factor. And here, we have 60m-40, so lemme get my scratch pad out again. So, I'm running out of space that way. So, we have, write it like this. We have 60, 60m-40. Minus 40."
Math,"So, what is the greatest common factor of 60m and 40? Well, 10 might jump out at us. We might say, okay, look, you know? 60 is 10, so we could say this is the same thing as 10 times six and actually, and then, of course, you have the M there, so you could do this 10 times 6m. And then you could view, you could view this as 10 times four. But we, 10 still isn't the greatest common factor. You'll say, well, how do you know that? Well, because four and six still share a factor in common. They still share two."
Math,"So, if you're actually factoring out the greatest common factor, what's left should not share a factor with each other. So, let me think even harder about what a greatest common factor of 60 and 40 is. Well, two times 10 is 20. So, you could actually factor out a 20. So, you have 20 and 30m. Sorry, 20 and 3m. And 40 could be factored out into 20 and, 20 and two. And now 3m and two, 3m and two share no common factors. So, you know that you have fully factored these two things out."
Math,"Now, if you think this is something kind of a strange art that I just did, one way to think about greatest common factors, you say, okay, 60, you could literally do a prime factorization. You could say 60 is two times 30, which is two times 15, which is three times five. So, that's 60's prime factorization. Two times two times three times five. And then 40's prime factorization is two times 20, 20 is two times 10. 10 is two times five. So, that right over here, this is 40's prime factorization."
Math,"And to get out the greatest common factor, you wanna get out as many common prime factors. So you have, here, you have two twos and a five. Here, you have two twos and a five. You can't go to three twos and a five 'cause there aren't three twos and a five over here. So, we have two twos and a five here. Two twos and a five here. So, two times two times five is going to be the greatest common factor. So, two times two times five, that's four times five. Four times five, that is 20."
Math,"That's one way of kind of very systematically figuring out a greatest common factor. But anyway, now that we know that 20 is the greatest common factor, let's factor it out. So, this is going to be equal to 20 times, so 60m divided by 20, you're just going to be left with 3m. Just going to be left with 3m. And then minus, minus 40 divided by 20, you're just left with the two. Minus two. Minus two, so let's type that in. So, this is going to be 20 times, 20(3m-2)."
Math,"And once again, we feel good that we, literally, we did take out the greatest common factor because 3m and two, especially three and two are now relatively prime. Relatively prime just means they don't share any factors in common other than one.."
Math,"And this might seem a little bit obvious, but how many Chuck Norrises do I now have? Well, 2 Chuck Norrises, we can represent this as literally a Chuck Norris plus a Chuck Norris. So let me do that, a Chuck Norris plus another Chuck Norris, 2 Chuck Norrises. You could also do this 2 times Chuck Norris, and this is just another way of representing it. And 3 Chuck Norrises-- you could do that as a Chuck Norris plus a Chuck Norris plus another Chuck Norris."
Math,"And so we would have a grand total-- and this might be very simple for you. But you would have a grand total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Chuck Norrises. So this would be equal to 5 Chuck Norrises. Now, let's get a little bit more abstract here. Chuck Norris is a very tangible thing. So let's go to a little bit more of traditional algebraic notation. If I have 2x's and remember, you could do this as 2x's or 2 times x. And to that, I would add 3x's How many x's do I have? Well, once again, 2x's, that's 2 times x."
Math,"You could do that as an x plus an x. We don't know what the value of x is. But whatever that value is, we can add it to itself. And then 3x's are they're going to be that value. Let me do that in that same green color. 3x's are going to be that value plus that value plus whatever that value is. And so how many x's do I now have? Well, I'm going to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 x's. So 2x plus 3x is equal to 5x."
Math,"And if you think about it, all we really did-- and hopefully, you conceptually get it-- is we just added the 2 numbers that were multiplying the x. And these numbers, the 2 or the 3, they're called coefficients. Very fancy word, but it's just this constant number, this regular number that's multiplied by the variable. You just added the 2 and the 3, to get your 5x. Now, let's think about this a little bit more. Let's go back to this original expression, the 2 Chuck Norrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises."
Math,"Let's say, to that, we were to add to some type of a-- let's we were to add 7 plums over here. So this is my drawing of a plum. So we have 7 plums plus 2 Chuck Norrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises. And let's say that I add another 2 plums. I add another 2 plums here. So what this whole thing be? Well, I wouldn't add the 7 to the 2 to the 3 plus the 2. We're adding different things here. You have 2 Chuck Norrises and 3 Chuck Norrises, so they're still going to simplify to 5 Chuck Norrises. ."
Math,"And then we would separately think about the plums. We have 7 plums, and we're adding another 2 plums. We're going to have 9 plums. Plus 9 plums, so this simplifies to five Chuck Norrises and 9 plums. Similarly, over here, instead of just 2x plus 3x, if I had 7y plus 2x plus 3x plus 2y, what do I now have? Well, I can't add the x's and the y's. They could very well represent a different number. So all I can do is really add the x's. And then I get the 5x. And then, I'd separately add the y."
Math,"If I have 7y's and to that I add 2y's, I'm going to have 9y's. If I have 7 of something and I add 2 of something, I now have 9 of that something. So I'm going to have 9y's. So you add that. Do that in a different color. You add this and this. You get that. You add the x's. You get that right over there. So hopefully, that makes a little sense. Actually I'll throw out one more idea."
Math,"So given this, what would happen if I were to have 2x plus 1 plus 7x plus 5? Well, once again, you might be tempted to add the 2 plus the 1, but they're adding different things. These are 2x's. This is just the number 1. So you really just have to add the x's together. So you're going to say, well, I got 2x's. And I'm going to add 7x's to that. Well, that means I now have 9x's. And then, separately, you'd say, well, I've got just the abstract number 1. And then I've got another 5."
Math,1 plus 5 is going to be equal to 6..
Math,"Well, this is fairly basic. You had 3 apples. Now, I'm going to give you 7 more. You now have 3 plus 7. You now have 10 apples. But let's say I want to do the same type of thinking, but I'm too lazy to write the word ""apples."" Let's say instead of writing the word ""apples,"" I just use the letter a. And let's say this is, say, a different scenario. You start off with 4 apples. And to that, I add another 2 apples. How many apples do you now have? Instead of writing apples, I'm just going to write a's here."
Math,"So how many of these a's do you now have? And once again, I'll give you a few seconds to think about that. This also might be a little bit of common sense for you. If you had 4 of these apples or whatever these a's represented, if you had 4 of them and then you add 2 more of them, you're now going to have 6 of these apples. But once again, we started off assuming that a's represent apples. But they could have represented anything."
Math,"If you have 4 of whatever a represents, and then you have another 2 of whatever a represents, you'll now have 6 of whatever a represents. Or if you just think of it if I have 4 a's, and then I add another 2 a's, I'm going to have 6 a's. You can literally think of 4 a's as a plus a plus a plus a. And if to that, I add another 2 a's-- so plus a plus a, that's 2 a's right over there-- how many a's do I now have? Well, that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I now have 6 a's."
Math,"So thinking of it that way, let's get a little bit more abstract. Let's say that I have 5 x's, whatever x represents. x could be some number. So I have 5 of whatever that number is. And from that, I subtract 2 of whatever that number is. What would this evaluate to? How many of these x's would I now have? So it's essentially 5x minus 2x is going to be what times x? Once again, I'll give you a few seconds to think about it."
Math,"Well, if I have 5 of something and I subtract 2 of those away, I'm going to have 3 of that something left. So this is going to be equal to 3x. 5x minus 2x is equal to 3x. And if you really think about what that means, five x's are just x plus x plus x plus x plus x. And then we're going to take away two of those x's. So take away one x, take away two x's. You are going to be left with three x's.."
Math,"Let's just think about it, step by step. And it might help if we were to actually reorder the terms in this expression. So let me put all the x terms first. So I have 5x-- that's that term-- minus 2x. Then I have plus 7y plus 3y. Then i have plus 8z, and then I have minus z. And then the last term that I haven't included yet is that plus 5. Now we'll just think it through. If I have 5 x's and I were to take away 2 x's, is how many x's am I going to be left with? Well, I'm going to be left with 3 x's."
Math,"That's true of anything. There's not some fancy algebraic magic going on here. 5 of anything minus 2 of that same thing, you're going to be left with 3 of that thing. In this case, that thing are x's. So this is going to simplify to 3x. Now, in a lot of algebra classes, you'll hear people say, oh, well, you know, the coefficient on 5x is 5. And the coefficient on this subtracting the 2x, the coefficient here is negative 2, and we had to add the coefficients. Let me write that word down-- coefficient."
Math,"These right over here are the coefficients. They're the number that you're multiplying the variable by. So you're the 5 or the negative 2 in this case. And so you could just say, oh, I had to just add the coefficients. And that's OK, and there's nothing wrong with that. But I really want to emphasize that there's a very common sense intuition here. If you have 5 of something, you take away 2 of that something, you are left with 3 of that something. And you have to be very careful."
Math,"You have to make sure that you're adding and subtracting the same things. Here, we're dealing with x's. So we can take 5 x's and take away 2 x's. We can't think about merging the x's and the y's, at least not in any simple way right now, because that, frankly, wouldn't make any intuitive sense. Now let's think about the y's. If I have 7 of something, and I were to add 3 more of that something, well, then, I'm going to have 10 of that something. So this part right over here is going to simplify to 10y."
Math,"Once again, you could say the coefficient on 7y is 7. The coefficient on 3y is 3. We added the coefficients-- 7 plus 3-- to get 10y. But I really want to emphasize the intuition here. It's much more if you've got 7 of something, you add another 3 to that something, you've got 10 of that something. Now let's look at the z's. If I've got 8 of something and I take away 1 of them, I'm going to have 7 of that something. So that is 7z. And you might say, hey, wait."
Math,"What was the coefficient right here on this negative z? I don't see any number out front of the z. Well, implicitly, I could have put a 1 here, and it's exactly the same thing. Subtracting a z is the exact same thing as subtracting 1z. The word ""onesie"" strikes a part of my brain because I have very young children, but that's a different type of onesie. And then you could see, oh, yeah, you definitely did add the two coefficients, the 8 and the negative 1."
Math,"But once again, common sense tells you if you have 8 of something, and you take away 1 of them, you have 7 of that something. And then finally, you have a plus 5. So we're done. This simplified to 3x plus 10y plus 7z plus 5.."
Math,"Let me just rewrite it so I have x plus... x plus two-y plus x plus two. So, the first thing that jumps out at me, before I even look at these choices, here I have an x over here, I have an x over there. Well, if I have one x, and then I can add it to another x that would be two-x so I could rewrite this... let me do this in a different color. I could rewrite this x and this x, if I add them together that's going to be two-x. So, this is...actually, I don't want to skip any steps."
Math,"So, that's x plus x plus two-y... now I'm just switching the order...plus two. And then these two x's right over here, I can just rewrite that as two-x. So, I have two-x plus two-y... plus two-y plus two. Now, let's see, out of all my choices... so, this one, this is two-x plus four-y plus four. So, that's not right, I have two-x plus two-y plus 2, so I can rule this one out. Now, this one's interesting, it looks like they have factored out a two."
Math,"Let's see if we factor out a two here, what happens? So, we do see that two is a factor of that term, it's a factor of that term, and it's a factor of that term. So, let's see if we can factor it out. So, this is going to be two times x, I'll do the x in that same magenta color, two times x plus, we have just a y left when you factor out the two. And then if you factor out a two here, you're just going to have a one left. So, two times x plus y plus one. Which is exactly what they have over here."
Math,"And since I was able to find a choice, I will not pick ""None of the above"".."
Math,"It's going to be 28. We can say 2 times 7. We could say 3 divided by 4. In all of these cases, we know exactly what numbers we're dealing with. As we start entering into the algebraic world-- and you probably have seen this a little bit already-- we start dealing with the ideas of variables. And variables, there's a bunch of ways you can think about them, but they're really just values in expressions where they can change. The values in those expressions can change."
Math,"For example, if I write x plus 5, this is an expression right over here. This can take on some value depending on what the value of x is. If x is equal to 1, then x plus 5, our expression right over here, is going to be equal to 1. Because now x is 1. It'll be 1 plus 5, so x plus 5 will be equal to 6. If x is equal to, I don't know, negative 7, then x plus 5 is going to be equal to-- well, now x is negative 7. It's going to be negative 7 plus 5, which is negative 2."
Math,"So notice x here is a variable, and its value can change depending on the context. And this is in the context of an expression. You'll also see it in the context of an equation. It's actually important to realize the distinction between an expression and an equation. An expression is really just a statement of value, a statement of some type of quantity. So this is an expression. An expression would be something like what we saw over here, x plus 5."
Math,"The value of this expression will change depending on what the value of this variable is. And you could just evaluate it for different values of x. Another expression could be something like, I don't know, y plus z. Now everything is a variable. If y is 1 and z is 2, it's going to be 1 plus 2. If y is 0 and z is negative 1, it's going to be 0 plus negative 1. These can all be evaluated, and they'll essentially give you a value depending on the values of each of these variables that make up the expression."
Math,"An equation, you're essentially setting expressions to be equal to each other. That's why they're called equations. You're equating two things. An equation, you'll see one expression being equal to another expression. For example, you could say something like x plus 3 is equal to 1. And in this situation where you have one equation with only one unknown, you can actually figure out what x needs to be in this scenario. And you might even do it in your head."
Math,"What plus 3 is equal to 1? Well, you could do that in your head. If I have negative 2, plus 3 is equal to 1. In this context, an equation is starting to constrain what value this variable can take on. But it doesn't have to necessarily constrain it as much. You could have something like x plus y plus z is equal to 5. Now you have this expression is equal to this other expression. 5 is really just an expression right over here. And there are some constraints."
Math,"If someone tells you what y and z is, then you're going to get an x. If someone tells you what x and y is, then that constrains what z is. But it depends on what the different things are. For example, if we said y is equal to 3 and z is equal to 2, then what would be x in that situation? If y is equal to 3 and z is equal to 2, then you're going to have the left-hand expression is going to be x plus 3 plus 2. It's going to be x plus 5. This part right over here is just going to be 5. x plus 5 is equal to 5."
Math,"And so what plus 5 is equal to 5? Well, now we're constraining that x would have to be equal to 0. Hopefully you realize the difference between expression and equation. In an equation, essentially you're equating two expressions. The important thing to take away from here is that a variable can take on different values depending on the context of the problem. And to hit the point home, let's just evaluate a bunch of expressions when the variables have different values."
Math,"For example, if we had the expression x to the y power, if x is equal to 5 and y is equal to 2, then our expression here is going to evaluate to, well, x is now going to be 5. y is going to be 2. It's going to be 5 to the second power, or it's going to evaluate to 25. If we changed the values-- let me do that in that same color-- if we said x is equal to negative 2 and y is equal to 3, then this expression would evaluate to-- let me do it in that-- negative 2."
Math,"That's what we're going to substitute for x now in this context. And y is now 3, negative 2 to the third power, which is negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2, which is negative 8. Negative 2 times negative 2 is positive 4, times negative 2 again is equal to negative 8. We could do even more complex things. We could have an expression like the square root of x plus y and then minus x, like that. Let's say that x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 8."
Math,"Then this expression would evaluate to, well, every time we see an x, we want to put a 1 there. So we would have a 1 there, and you'd have a 1 over there. And every time you see a y, you would put an 8 in its place in this context. We're setting these variables. So you'd see an 8. Under the radical sign, you would have a 1 plus 8. So you'd have the principal root of 9, which is 3. This whole thing would simplify."
Math,"In this context, when we set these variables to be these things, this whole thing would simplify to be 3. 1 plus 8 is 9. The principal root of that is 3. And then you'd have 3 minus 1, which is equal to 2.."
Math,"And so, I have three options here, I have x could be equal to five, x could be equal to six, and x could be equal to seven. And your goal is to pause this video and figure out which of these x's satisfies this equation, which of these values would make this equation be true. So, I'm assuming that you have tried that, so let's work through each of them, step one by one."
Math,"So let's see this first one: if x is equal to five, then in order for this to be true, five time five, right, five times x, so five times five minus three needs to be equal to four times, everywhere we see an x we're going to put a five there, four times, actually let me do it this way. Let me just color code it. So this is the same thing as saying five times five minus three, let me do that in that same color, minus three, needs to be equal to four times five, four times five plus three, plus three."
Math,"Color changing is hard. Plus three. Now, is this true? Let's see, five times five is 25, it's going to be 25 minus three, needs to be equal to 20 plus three. 25 minus three is 22, needs to be equal to 23. No, this is not true. So, x does not equal five, so this is not a solution. Let's try x equals six."
Math,"So, once again, we're going to do five times our x, which is going to be six, actually let me just write it out, minus three needs to be equal to four times our x, plus three, and in this case our x is six, so it's going to be five times six minus three needs to be equal to four times six plus three. What's five times six? Well, it's 30 minus three, needs to be equal to four times six is 24, and then plus three. Well, this is true, 30 minus three is 27, which is indeed equal to 24 plus 3, it's equal to 27."
Math,"So x equals 6 does satisfy our equation, it is a solution, and actually as we'll see in the future, the solution to this equation right over here. X equals six satisfies this. Now, just for good measure, let's just varify that x equals seven will not satisfy. So I'm going to move this up a little bit. So if x is equal to seven, we're going to get five times seven minus three needs to be equal to four time seven plus three."
Math,"And so, we're going to get, and in all these cases we do the multiplication first, order of operations, and it's very clear when you see it kind of in the algebraic notation up here, so we're going to do 35 minus three needs to be equal to 28 plus three, 35 minus three is 32, 28 plus three is 31, these do not equal each other. So this is not a solution to our original equation.."
Math,"It's a big question mark on this blue mass right over here. And we also have a bunch of 1-- I guess we could call them 1-kilogram masses. So these are all each a 1-kilogram mass. And my question to you is, what could we do to either side of this scale in order to figure out what the mystery mass is? Or maybe we can't figure it out at all."
Math,"Is there something that we can do, either removing or adding these things, so that we can figure out what this mystery mass is? And I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about that. Well, to figure out what this mystery mass is, we essentially just want this on one side of this scale. But that by itself isn't enough."
Math,"We could just remove these 3, but that won't do the job, because if we just remove these 3, then the left-hand side of the scale is clearly going to have less mass, and it's going to go up, and the right side is going to go down. And that's not going to give as much information. It's just going to tell us that this blue thing has a lower mass than what's over here. So just removing this won't help us much. It won't let us know that this is equal to that."
Math,"Well, what we've got to do if we want to keep the scale balanced is we've got to remove the same amount of mass from both sides of the scale. So if we want to remove 3 things here-- so let me try my best to remove 3 things here. If we want to remove 3-- let me do it like this. I'll just color on it. I'll just erase it. So if we want to remove 3 things there, if we did this by itself, just removed these 3 things, then the two sides would not have an equal mass anymore."
Math,"This side over here would have a lower mass. So we've got to remove 3 from both sides. So if we really want to make sure that our scale is balanced, we've got to remove 3 from both sides. And so if we started off with the scales balanced and then we removed 3 from both sides, the scale will still be balanced. And then when we do that, we have a clearer idea of what the mass of this object actually is. Now, when we remove 3 from both sides, the scale will still be balanced."
Math,"And we know that this mass is equal to whatever's left over here. It's equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And if we're assuming they're kilograms, we'll know that the question mark mass is equal to 7 kilograms, that this right over here is a 7-kilogram mass.."
Math,"And I'll give you some hints. We know that they have equal mass. So maybe you can set up some type of relationship using an equal sign, somehow showing that this right over here is equal to that. And I'll give you a few seconds to do that. So let's think about it a little bit. What do we have on this side? Well, we have our mystery mass. And I'll represent that mystery mass by the question mark right over here. But that's not the only thing that we have on the left-hand side."
Math,"We also have these other 3 kilograms. So let me write over here. We'll assume that we're dealing with kilograms. So we have the mystery mass in kilograms plus 3 more kilograms. That's what we have here on the left-hand side. Now, what do we have here on the right-hand side? Well, we just have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 kilograms. So we just have 10. We just have 10 on the right-hand side. And what else do we know? Well, we know that this scale is balanced, that the mass here is equal to the mass here."
Math,"Because the scale is balanced the way it's been drawn, we know that these two things are equal. So we have just set up an equation. We're using question mark as our unknown. We don't know what this mystery mass is. If we add 3 kilograms to it, then we see that it has the exact same mass as 10 kilograms."
Math,"Now my question to you is, what can we do to this equation so that we can essentially solve for the unknown, so that we can figure out what the unknown is? Well, we saw in the last little problem that we had that if we wanted to figure out this mystery mass, we had to remove 3 kilograms from both sides. If we just removed 3 kilograms from one side, then the scale wouldn't be balanced anymore. And we really wouldn't be able to say that the mystery mass is equal to the thing on the right."
Math,"In order to say they're equal, the stuff has to actually be balanced. So in the last video, we removed 3 of these. We removed 3 kilograms from both sides in order to keep the scale balanced. So mathematically, we'll do the exact same thing over here. We will remove 3, not from one side. If we remove 3 from one side, then it wouldn't be equal anymore. We need to remove 3 from both sides. So we need to remove 3. We need to subtract 3 from both sides of this equation in order to keep the scale balanced."
Math,"So on the left-hand side, what are we left with? Well, just like over here, we're left with just the question 3 minus 3 is 0. So on the left-hand side, we're left with just the question And on the right-hand side, we're left with 10 minus 3, which is 7. And we get the exact same result. Question mark is equal to 7. And if we're dealing with kilograms, then this is 7 kilograms.."
Math,"We have the same total mass on the left hand side that we have on the right hand side. Instead of labeling the mystery masses as question mark, I've labeled them all x. And since they all have an x on it, we know that each of these have the same mass. But what I'm curious about is, what is that mass? What is the mass of each of these mystery masses, I guess we could say? And so I'll let think about that for a second."
Math,"How would you figure out what this x value actually is? How many kilograms is the mass of each of these things? What could you do to either one or both sides of this scale? I'll give you a few seconds to think about that. So you might be tempted to say, well if I could end up with just one mystery mass on the left hand side, and if I keep my scale balanced, then that thing's going to be equal to whatever I have on the right hand side. And that part would actually be a true statement."
Math,"But then to get only one of these mystery masses on the left hand side, you might say, well why don't I just remove two of them? You might just say, well why don't I just remove-- let me do it a good color for removing-- why don't I just remove that one and that one? And then I'll just be left with that right over there. But if you just removed these two, then the left hand side is going to become lighter or it's going to have a lower mass than the right hand side."
Math,"So it's going to move up and the right hand side is going to move down. And then you might say, OK, I understand. Whatever I have to do to the left hand side, I have to do to the right hand side in order to keep my scale balanced. So you might say, well why don't I remove two of these mystery masses from the right hand side? But that's a problem too because you don't know what this mystery mass is."
Math,"You could try to remove two from this, but how many of these blocks represent a mystery mass? We actually don't know. But you might then say, well let's see, I've got three of these things here. If I essentially multiply what I have here by 1/3 or if I only leave a 1/3 of the stuff here, and if I only leave a 1/3 of the stuff here, then the scale should be balanced. If this has the total mass as this, then 1/3 of this total mass is going to be the same thing as 1/3 of that total mass."
Math,"So let's just keep only 1/3 of this here. So that's the equivalent to multiplying by 1/3. So if we're only going to keep 1/3 there, we're going to be left with only one of the masses. And if we only keep 1/3 here, let's see, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine masses. If we multiply this by 1/3, or if we only keep 1/3 of it there, 1/3 times 9 is 3. So we're going to remove these ."
Math,"And so we have 1/3 of what we originally had on the right hand side and 1/3 of what we originally had on the left hand side. And they will be balanced because we took 1/3 of the same total masses. And so what you're left with is just one of these mystery masses, this x thing right over here, whatever x might be. And you have three kilograms on the right hand side. And so you can make the conclusion, and the whole time you kept this thing balanced, that x is equal to 3.."
Math,"And each of these nine objects have a mass of 1 kilograms. So in total, you have 9 kilograms on this side. And over here, you have three objects. They all have the same mass. And we don't know what it is. We're just calling that mass x. And what I want to do here is try to tackle this a little bit more symbolically."
Math,"In the last video, we said, hey, why don't we just multiply 1/3 of this and multiply 1/3 of this? And then, essentially, we're going to keep things balanced, because we're taking 1/3 of the same mass. This total is the same as this total. That's why the scale is balanced. Now, let's think about how we can represent this symbolically."
Math,"So the first thing I want you to think about is, can we set up an equation that expresses that we have these three things of mass x, and that in total, their mass is equal to the total mass over here? Can we express that as an equation? And I'll give you a few seconds to do it. Well, let's think about it. Over here, we have three things with mass x. So their total mass, we could write as-- we could write their total mass as x plus x plus x. And over here, we have nine things with mass of 1 kilogram."
Math,"I guess we could write 1 plus 1 plus 1. That's 3. Plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1. How many is that? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And actually, this is a mathematical representation. If we set it up as an equation, it's an algebraic representation. It's not the simplest possible way we can do it, but it is a reasonable way to do it. If we want, we can say, well, if I have an x plus another x plus another x, I have three x's. So I could rewrite this as 3x."
Math,"And 3x will be equal to? Well, if I sum up all of these 1's right over here-- 1 plus 1 plus 1. We're doing that. We have 9 of them, so we get 3x is equal to 9. And let me make sure I did that. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So that's how we would set it up. And so the next question is, what would we do? What can we do mathematically? Actually, to either one of these equations, but we'll focus on this one right now."
Math,"What can we do mathematically in order to essentially solve for the x? In order to figure out what that mystery mass actually is? And I'll give you another second or two to think about it. Well, when we did it the last time with just the scales we said, OK, we've got three of these x's here. We want to have just one x here. So we can say, whatever this x is, if the scale stays balanced, it's going to be the same as whatever we have there."
Math,"There might be a temptation to subtract two of the x's maybe from this side, but that won't help us. And we can even see it mathematically over here. If we subtract two x's from both sides, on the left-hand side you're going to have 3x minus 2x. And on the right-hand side, you're going to have 9 minus 2x. And you're just going to be left with 3 of something minus 2 something is just 1 of something. So you will just have an x there if you get rid of two of them."
Math,"But on the right-hand side, you're going to get 9 minus 2 So the x's still didn't help you out. You still have a mystery mass on the right-hand side. So that doesn't help. So instead, what we say is-- and we did this the last time. We said, well, what if we took 1/3 of these things? If we take 1/3 of these things and take 1/3 of these things, we should still get the same mass on both sides because the original things had the same mass."
Math,"And the equivalent of doing that mathematically is to say, why don't we multiply both sides by 1/3? Or another way to say it is we could divide both sides by 3. Multiplying by 1/3 is the same thing as dividing by 3. So we're going to multiply both sides by 1/3. When you multiply both sides by 1/3-- visually over here, if you had three x's, you multiply it by 1/3, you're only going to have one x left. If you have nine of these one-kilogram boxes, you multiply it by 1/3, you're only going to have three left."
Math,"And over here, you can even visually-- if you divide by 3, which is the same thing as multiplying by 1/3, you divide by 3. So you divide by 3. You have an x is equal to a 1 plus 1 plus 1. An x is equal to 3. Or you see here, an x is equal to 3. Over here you do the math. 1/3 times 3 is 1. You're left with 1x. So you're left with x is equal to 9 times 1/3. Or you could even view it as 9 divided by 3, which is equal to 3.."
Math,"I'd want to get rid of the seven. I want to subtract seven from the left-hand side, but if I want to maintain an equality here, whatever I do to the left-hand side I also have to do to the right-hand side going back to our scales that's so that we can keep our scale balanced, so that we can say that the left is still equal to the right. And so what we're going to be left with is x and then the sevens cancel out is equal to ten minus seven is equal to three."
Math,"So that unknown is three, and you can verify it, three plus seven is indeed equal to ten. Let's try one more. Let's say we have a minus five is equal to negative two. So this is a little bit more interesting since we have all of these negative numbers here, but we can use the exact same logic. We just want an a over here on the left-hand side so we have to get rid of this negative five somehow. Well the best way of getting rid of a negative 5 is to add five to it. So I'll do that."
Math,"So I will add five to the left-hand side. But if I want the left-hand side to stay equal to the right-hand side, whatever I do to the left I have to do the right. So I'm going to have to add five on the right-hand side as well, and so on the left-hand side I'm left with a, and then the negative five and the positive five cancel out and on the right hand side, and they're going to stay equal because I did the same thing to both sides, we have negative two plus five which is equal to three."
Math,So a is equal to three. Once again you can verify it. Three minus five is indeed equal to negative two..
Math,"And if I add 5 to it, I will get 54. And you might be able to do this in your head. But we're going to do it a little bit more systematically. Because that'll be helpful for you when we do more complicated problems. So in general, whenever you have an equation like this, we want to have the variable. We want this a all by itself on one side of the equation. We want to isolate it. It's already on the left-hand side, so let's try to get rid of everything else on the left-hand side."
Math,"Well, the only other thing on the left-hand side is this positive 5. Well, the best way to get rid of a plus 5, or a positive 5, is to subtract 5. So let's subtract 5. But remember, this says a plus 5 is equal to 54. If we want the equality to still hold, anything we do to the left-hand side of this equation, we have to do to the right side of the equation. So we also have to subtract 54 from the right. So we have a plus 5 minus 5. Well, that's just going to be a plus 0."
Math,"Because if you add 5 and you subtract 5, they cancel out. So a plus 0 is just a. And then 54 minus 5, that is 49. And we're done. We have solved for a. A is equal to 49. And now we can check it. And we can check it by just substituting 49 back for a in our original equation. So instead of writing a plus 5 is equal to 54, let's see if 49 plus 5 is equal to 54. So we're just substituting it back in. 49, 49 plus-- let me do that in that same shade of green. 49 plus 5 is equal to 54."
Math,"We're trying to check this. 49 plus 5 is 54. And that, indeed, is equal to 54. So it all checks out.."
Math,"But let's think about what at least I think might be the simplest way. And before I work through anything, you should always try to pause the video, and do it on your own. So what I like to think about is can I have just my A on one side of the equation? And since it's already on the left-hand side, let's see if I can keep it on the left-hand side, but get rid of this 1/3 somehow. Well the easiest was I can think of getting rid of this 1/3 is to subtract 1/3 from the left-hand side of the equation."
Math,"Now I can't just do that from the left-hand side of the equation. If 1/3 plus A is equal to 5/3, and if I just subtract 1/3 from the left-hand side, then they're not going to be equal anymore. Then this thing is going to be 1/3 less, which this thing isn't going to change. So then this thing on the left would become less than 5/3. So in order to hold the equality, whatever I do on the left-hand side I have to do on the right-hand side as well. So I have to subtract 1/3 from both sides."
Math,"And if I do that, then on the left-hand side, 1/3 minus 1/3, that's the whole reason why I subtracted 1/3 was to get rid of the 1/3, and I am left with A is equal to 5/3 minus 1/3, 5/3 minus 1/3, minus 1/3, and what is that going to be equal to? I have five of something, in this case I have 5/3, and I'm gonna subtract 1/3. So I'm gonna be left with 4/3. So I could write A is equal to 4/3. And you could check to make sure that works. 1/3 plus 4/3 is indeed equal to 5/3. Let's do another one of these."
Math,"So let's say that we have the equation K minus eight is equal to 11.8. So once again I wanna solve for K. I wanna have just a K on the left-hand side. I don't want this subtracting this eight right over here. So in order to get rid of this eight, let's add eight on the left-hand side. And of course, if I do it on the left-hand side, I have to do it on the right-hand side as well. So we're gonna add eight to both sides. The left-hand side, you are substracting eight and then you're adding eight."
Math,"That's just going to cancel out, and you're just going to be left with K. And on the right-hand side, 11.8 plus eight. Well, 11 plus eight is 19, so it's going to be 19.8. And we're done, and once again, what's neat about equations, you can always check to see if you got the right answer. 19.8 minus eight is 11.8. Let's do another one, this is too much fun. Alright, so let's say that I had 5/13 is equal to T minus 6/13. Alright, this is interesting 'cause now I have my variable on the right-hand side."
Math,"But let's just leave it there. Let's just see if we can solve for T by getting rid of everything else on the right-hand side. And like we've done in the past, if I'm subtracting 6/13, so why don't I just add it? Why don't I just add 6/13? I can't just do that on the right-hand side. Then the two sides won't be equal anymore, so I gotta do it on the left-hand side if I wanna hold the equality."
Math,"So what happens? So what happens? On the left-hand side I have, let me give myself a little bit more space, I have 5/13 plus 6/13, plus 6/13 are equal to, are equal to... Well, I was subtracting 6/13, now I add 6/13. Those are just going to add to zero. 6/13 minus 6/13 is just zero, so you're left with T. So T is equal to this. If I have 5/13 and I add to that 6/13, well I'm gonna have 11/13. So this is going to be 11/13 is equal to T, or I could write that the other way around."
Math,I could write T is equal to 11/13..
Math,"Now you might be able to do this in your head. You could literally go through the 7 times table. You say well 7 times 1 is equal to 7, so that won't work. 7 times 2 is equal to 14, so 2 works here. So you would immediately be able to solve it. You would immediately, just by trying different numbers out, say hey, that's going to be a 2. But what we're going to do in this video is to think about how to solve this systematically."
Math,"Because what we're going to find is as these equations get more and more complicated, you're not going to be able to just think about it and do it in your head. So it's really important that one, you understand how to manipulate these equations, but even more important to understand what they actually represent. This literally just says 7 times x is equal to 14. In algebra we don't write the times there."
Math,"When you write two numbers next to each other or a number next to a variable like this, it just means that you are multiplying. It's just a shorthand, a shorthand notation. And in general we don't use the multiplication sign because it's confusing, because x is the most common variable used in algebra. And if I were to write 7 times x is equal to 14, if I write my times sign or my x a little bit strange, it might look like xx or times times."
Math,"So in general when you're dealing with equations, especially when one of the variables is an x, you wouldn't use the traditional multiplication sign. You might use something like this -- you might use dot to represent multiplication. So you might have 7 times is equal to 14. But this is still a little unusual. If you have something multiplying by a variable you'll just write 7x. That literally means 7 times x. Now, to understand how you can manipulate this equation to solve it, let's visualize this."
Math,"So 7 times x, what is that? That's the same thing -- so I'm just going to re-write this equation, but I'm going to re-write it in visual form. So 7 times x. So that literally means x added to itself 7 times. That's the definition of multiplication. So it's literally x plus x plus x plus x plus x -- let's see, that's 5 x's -- plus x plus x. So that right there is literally 7 x's. This is 7x right there. Let me re-write it down. This right here is 7x. Now this equation tells us that 7x is equal to 14."
Math,"So just saying that this is equal to 14. Let me draw 14 objects here. So let's say I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. So literally we're saying 7x is equal to 14 things. These are equivalent statements. Now the reason why I drew it out this way is so that you really understand what we're going to do when we divide both sides by 7. So let me erase this right here. So the standard step whenever -- I didn't want to do that, let me do this, let me draw that last circle."
Math,"So in general, whenever you simplify an equation down to a -- a coefficient is just the number multiplying the variable. So some number multiplying the variable or we could call that the coefficient times a variable equal to something else. What you want to do is just divide both sides by 7 in this case, or divide both sides by the coefficient. So if you divide both sides by 7, what do you get? 7 times something divided by 7 is just going to be that original something."
Math,"7's cancel out and 14 divided by 7 is 2. So your solution is going to be x is equal to 2. But just to make it very tangible in your head, what's going on here is when we're dividing both sides of the equation by 7, we're literally dividing both sides by 7. This is an equation. It's saying that this is equal to that. Anything I do to the left hand side I have to do to the right. If they start off being equal, I can't just do an operation to one side and have it still be equal. They were the same thing."
Math,"So if I divide the left hand side by 7, so let me divide it into seven groups. So there are seven x's here, so that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven groups. Now if I divide that into seven groups, I'll also want to divide the right hand side into seven groups. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
Math,"So if this whole thing is equal to this whole thing, then each of these little chunks that we broke into, these seven chunks, are going to be equivalent. So this chunk you could say is equal to that chunk. This chunk is equal to this chunk -- they're all equivalent chunks. There are seven chunks here, seven chunks here. So each x must be equal to two of these objects. So we get x is equal to, in this case -- in this case we had the objects drawn out where there's two of them. x is equal to 2."
Math,"Now, let's just do a couple more examples here just so it really gets in your mind that we're dealing with an equation, and any operation that you do on one side of the equation you should do to the other. So let me scroll down a little bit. So let's say I have I say I have 3x is equal to 15. Now once again, you might be able to do is in your head. You're saying this is saying 3 times some number is equal to 15. You could go through your 3 times tables and figure it out."
Math,"But if you just wanted to do this systematically, and it is good to understand it systematically, say OK, this thing on the left is equal to this thing on the right. What do I have to do to this thing on the left to have just an x there? Well to have just an x there, I want to divide it by 3. And my whole motivation for doing that is that 3 times something divided by 3, the 3's will cancel out and I'm just going to be left with an x. Now, 3x was equal to 15."
Math,"If I'm dividing the left side by 3, in order for the equality to still hold, I also have to divide the right side by 3. Now what does that give us? Well the left hand side, we're just going to be left with an x, so it's just going to be an x. And then the right hand side, what is 15 divided by 3? Well it is just 5. Now you could also done this equation in a slightly different way, although they are really equivalent."
Math,"If I start with 3x is equal to 15, you might say hey, Sal, instead of dividing by 3, I could also get rid of this 3, I could just be left with an x if I multiply both sides of this equation by 1/3. So if I multiply both sides of this equation by 1/3 that should also work. You say look, 1/3 of 3 is 1. When you just multiply this part right here, 1/3 times 3, that is just 1, 1x. 1x is equal to 15 times 1/3 third is equal to 5."
Math,"And 1 times x is the same thing as just x, so this is the same thing as x is equal to 5. And these are actually equivalent ways of doing it. If you divide both sides by 3, that is equivalent to multiplying both sides of the equation by 1/3. Now let's do one more and I'm going to make it a little bit more complicated. And I'm going to change the variable a little bit. So let's say I have 2y plus 4y is equal to 18. Now all of a sudden it's a little harder to do it in your head."
Math,"We're saying 2 times something plus 4 times that same something is going to be equal to 18. So it's harder to think about what number that is. You could try them. Say if y was 1, it'd be 2 times 1 plus 4 times 1, well that doesn't work. But let's think about how to do it systematically. You could keep guessing and you might eventually get the answer, but how do you do this systematically. Let's visualize it. So if I have two y's, what does that mean? It literally means I have two y's added to each other."
Math,"So it's literally y plus y. And then to that I'm adding four y's. To that I'm heading four y's, which are literally four y's added to each other. So it's y plus y plus y plus y. And that has got to be equal to 18. So that is equal to 18. Now, how many y's do I have here on the left hand side? How many y's do I have? I have one, two, three, four, five, six y's. So you could simplify this as 6y is equal to 18. And if you think about it it makes complete sense."
Math,"So this thing right here, the 2y plus the 4y is 6y. So 2y plus 4y is 6y, which makes sense. If I have 2 apples plus 4 apples, I'm going to have 6 apples. If I have 2 y's plus 4 y's I'm going to have 6 y's. Now that's going to be equal to 18. And now, hopefully, we understand how to do this. If I have 6 times something is equal to 18, if I divide both sides of this equation by 6, I'll solve for the something. So divide the left hand side by 6, and divide the right hand side by 6."
Math,"And we are left with y is equal to 3. And you could try it out. That's what's cool about an equation. You can always check to see if you got the right answer. Let's see if that works. 2 times 3 plus 4 times 3 is equal to what? 2 times 3, this right here is 6. And then 4 times 3 is 12. 6 plus 12 is, indeed, equal to 18. So it works out.."
Math,"It's already sitting there. We have x divided by 3 is equal to 14. We could also write this as 1/3 x is equal to 14. Obviously, x times 1/3 is going to be x/3. These are equivalent. So how can we just end up with an x on the left-hand side of either of these equations? These are really the same thing. Or another way, how can we just have a 1 in front of the x, a 1x, which is really just saying x over here? Well, I'm dividing it by 3 right now."
Math,"So if I were to multiply both sides of this equation by 3, that would isolate the x. And the reason that would work is if I multiply this by 3 over here, I'm multiplying by 3 and dividing by 3. That's equivalent. That's equivalent to multiplying or dividing by 1. These guys cancel out. Remember, if you do it to the left-hand side, you also have to do it to the right-hand side. And actually, I'll do both of these equations at the same time, because they're really the exact same equation."
Math,"So what are we going to get over here on the left-hand side? 3 times anything divided by 3 is going to be that anything. We're just going to have an x left over on the left-hand side. And on the right-hand side, what's 14 times 3? 3 times 10 is 30, 3 times 4 is 12. So it's going to be 42. So we get x is equal to 42. And the same thing would happen here. 3 times 1/3 is just 1. So you get 1x is equal to 14 times 3, which is 42. Now let's just check our answer. Let's substitute 42 into our original equation."
Math,"So we have 42 in place for x over 3 is equal to 14. So what's 42 divided by 3? And we could do a little bit of-- I guess we call it medium-long division. It's not really long division. 3 into 4. 3 goes into 4 one time. 1 times 3 is 3. You subtract. 4 minus 3 is 1. Bring down the 2. 3 goes into 12 four times. 3 goes into 42 14 times. So this right over here simplifies to 14. And it all checks out, so we're done.."
Math,"So what do I have to multiply times 1.2 to get 0.6? And it might not jump out immediately in your brain but lucky for us we can think about this a little bit methodically. So one thing I like to do is say okay, I have the c on the left hand side, and I'm just multiplying it by 1.2, it would be great if this just said c. If this just said c instead of 1.2c."
Math,"So what can I do there? Well I could just divide by 1.2 but as we've seen multiple times, you can't just do that to the left hand side, that would change, you no longer could say that this is equal to that if you only operate on one side. So you have to divide by 1.2 on both sides. So on your left hand side, 1.2c divided by 1.2, well that's just going to be c."
Math,"You're just going to be left with c, and you're going to have c is equal to 0.6 over 1.2 Now what is that equal to? There's a bunch of ways you could approach it. The way I like to do it is, well let's just, let's just get rid of the decimals. Let's just multiply the numerator and denominator by a large enough number so that the decimals go away. So what happens if we multiply the numerator and the denominator by..."
Math,"Let's see if we multiply them by 10, you're gonna have a 6 in the numerator and 12 in the denominator, actually let's do that. Let's multiply the numerator and denominator by 10. So once again, this is the same thing as multiplying by 10 over 10, it's not changing the value of the fraction. So 0.6 times 10 is 6, and 1.2 times 10 is 12. So it's equal to six twelfths, and if we want we can write that in a little bit of a simpler way."
Math,"We could rewrite that as, divide the numerator and denominator by 6, you get 1 over 2, so this is equal to one half. And if you look back at the original equation, 1.2 times one half, you could view this as twelve tenths. Twelve tenths times one half is going to be equal to six tenths, so we can feel pretty good that c is equal to one half. Let's do another one. Let's say that we have 1 over 4 is equal to y over 12."
Math,"So how do we solve for y here? So we have a y on the right hand side, and it's being divided by 12. Well the best way I can think of of getting rid of this 12 and just having a y on the right hand side is multiplying both sides by 12. We do that in yellow. So if I multiply the right hand side by 12, I have to multiply the left hand side by 12. And once again, why did I pick 12? Well I wanted to multiply by some number, that when I multiply it by y over 12 I'm just left with y."
Math,"And so y times 12 divided by 12, well that's just going to be 1. And then on the left hand side you're going to have 12 times one fourth, which is twelve fourths. So you get 12 over 4, is equal to y. Or you could say y is equal to 12 over 4, y is equal to, let me do that just so you can see what I'm doing, just flopping the sides, doesn't change what's being said, y is equal to 12 over 4."
Math,"Now what is twelve fourths? Well, you can view this as 12 divided by 4, which is 3, or you could view this as twelve fourths which would be literally, 3 wholes. So you could say this would be equal to 3. Y is equal to 3, and you can check that. One fourth is equal to 3 over 12, so it all works out. That's the neat thing about equations, you can always check to see if you got the right answer. Let's do another one, can't stop. 4.5 is equal to 0.5n So like always, I have my n already on the right hand side."
Math,"But it's being multiplied by 0.5, it would be great if it just said n. So what can I do? Well I can divide both sides, I can divide both sides by 0.5, once again, if I do it to the right hand side I have to do it to the left hand side. And why am I dividing by 0.5? So I'm just left with an n on the right hand side. So this is going to be, so on the left hand side, I have 4.5 over 0.5, let me just, I don't want to skip too many steps."
Math,"4.5 over 0.5, is equal to n, because you have 0.5 divided by 0.5, you're just left with an n over here. So what does that equal to? Well 4.5 divided by 0.5, there's a couple ways to view this. You could view this as forty-five tenths divided by five tenths, which would tell you okay, this is going to be 9. Or if that seems a little bit confusing or a little bit daunting, you can do what we did over here."
Math,"You could multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, so that we get rid of the decimals. And in this case, if you multiply by 10 you can move the decimal one to the right. So once again, it has to be multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same thing. We're multiplying by 10 over 10, which is equivalent to 1, which tells us that we're not changing the value of this fraction. So let's see, this is going to be 45 over 5, is equal to n."
Math,"And some of you might say wait wait wait, hold on a second, you just told us whatever we do to one side of the equation, we have to do to the other side of the equation and here you are, you're just multiplying the left hand side of this equation by 10 over 10. Now remember, what is 10 over 10? 10 over 10 is just 1. Yes, if I wanted to, I could multiply the left hand side by 10 over 10, and I could multiply the right hand side by 10 over 10, but that's not going to change the value of the right hand side."
Math,"I'm not actually changing the values of the two sides. I'm just trying to rewrite the left hand side by multiplying it by 1 in kind of a creative way. But notice, n times 10 over 10, well that's still going to just be n. So I'm not violating this principle of whatever I do to the left hand side I do to the right hand side. You can always multiply one side by 1 and you can do that as many times as you want."
Math,"Like the same way you can add 0 or subtract 0 from one side, without necessarily having to show you're doing it to the other side, because it doesn't change the value. But anyways, you have n is equal to 45 over 5, well what's 45 over 5? Well that's going to be 9. So we have 9 is equal to, why did I switch to green? We have 9 is equal to n, or we could say n is equal to 9. And you could check that: 4.5 is equal to 0.5 times 9, yup half of 9 is 4.5 Let's do one more, because once again I can't stop."
Math,"Alright, let me get some space here, so we can keep the different problems apart that we had. So let's do, let's have a different variable now. Let's say we have g over 4 is equal to 3.2. Well I wanna get rid of this dividing by 4, so the easiest way I can think of doing that is multiplying both sides by 4."
Math,"So I'm multiplying both sides by 4, and the whole reason is 4 divided by 4 gives me 1, so I'm gonna have g is equal to, what's 3.2 times 4? Let's see 3 times 4 is 12, and two tenths times 4 is eight tenths, so it's gonna be 12 and eight tenths. G is going to be 12.8, and you can verify this is right. 12.8 divided by 4 is 3.2.."
Math,"Why five halves? Well, five halves, if you notice, when I multiply five halves times two-fifths, it's going to get us to one. Five times two is 10, two times five is 10. So it's going to be 10 over 10 or one, or you could think about five divided by five is one, two divided by two is one. And you might say, ""Is that magical? How did you think of five halves?"" Well, five halves is just the reciprocal of two-fifths. I just swapped the numerator and the denominator to get five halves."
Math,"And then why did I multiply it times the right-hand side? Well, anything I do to the left hand, I also want to do to the right hand. So the left-hand side simplifies to this is all one. So it's just going to be X is equal to, or we could say one X is equal to 10 times five halves. That's the same thing as 50 halves. I could write it this way, 50 over two, which is the same thing as 25. Let's do another example. Let's say we have the equation, 14 is equal to seven-thirds B. See if you can solve this."
Math,"Well, once again, it'd be nice if the coefficient on the B weren't seven-thirds, but instead were just a one. If it's just B is equal to something. Well, we know how to do that. We can multiply both sides of this equation times the reciprocal of the coefficient on B times the reciprocal of seven-thirds. What's the reciprocal of seven-thirds? Well, the denominator will become the numerator. The numerator becomes a denominator. It's going to be three-sevenths. Now, of course, I can't just do it on one side."
Math,"I have to do it on both sides. So on the right-hand side of this equation, three divided by three is one, seven divided by seven is one. Those all cancel out to one. So you're just left with one B or just to B and 30, or three-sevenths times 14, you might see this as 14 over one. And you could say okay, this is going to be three times 14 over seven times one, or you could say, hey, let's divide both a numerator and denominator by seven. So this could be two. And this could be one."
Math,"So your left with three times two over one times one which is just going to be equal to six. Let's do another example. Let's say that we had one sixth A is equal to two-thirds. How could we think about solving for A. Well, once again, it would be nice, if this one-sixth were to become a one and we could do that by multiplying by 6. Six-sixths is the same thing as one."
Math,"And to make it clear that this is the reciprocal, we could just write six wholes as six ones or six wholes when you multiply these, this is all going to be equal to one. So you're left with one A on the left-hand side, but of course, you can't just do it on the left-hand side. You have to also do it on the right-hand side. So A is going to be equal to, over here we could say two times six over three times one. So that would be twelve-thirds or we could say, look, six and three are both divisible by three."
Math,"So six divided by three is two, three divided by three is one, two times two is four over one times one. So it's going to be four wholes or just four and we're done.."
Math,"And they say, where did Lisa make her first mistake? So pause this video, and see if you can figure that out. And it might be possible she made no mistakes. All right. Well, we know she ends up with seven equals six, which is sketchy, so let's see what happened here. So right over here, it looks like, well, she did something a little bit strange. She divided the left-hand side by six, and the right hand side by a. You don't want to divide two sides of an equation by two different things."
Math,"Then it's no longer going to be an equation. The equality won't hold. An algebraically legitimate thing is to do the same thing to both sides, but she didn't do it here. So this is where she made her first mistake. Let's give another example here. So here it says that Jin tried to solve an equation. All right, x plus 4.7 is equal to 11.2. Where did Jin make his first mistake? Pause this video, and try to figure it out."
Math,"All right, so it looks like in order to isolate the x on the left-hand side, Jin is subtracting 4.7 from the left, and then also subtracting 4.7 from the right. So that is looking good, doing the same thing to both sides, subtracting 4.7 from both sides. And then over here on the left-hand side, these two would cancel. So you'd be left with just an x, and let's see, 11.2 minus 4.7. 11.2 minus four would be 7.2, and then minus the 0.7 would be 6.5."
Math,"So this is where Jin made his mistake, on the calculating part. Let's do another example, this is a lot of fun. So here we are told that Marina tried to solve an equation, and we need to figure out where Marina made her first mistake. All right, one-sixth is equal to two-thirds, why? So the first step, or the first thing that Marina did right over here is to multiply both sides of this equation by the reciprocal of two-thirds, which is three halves."
Math,"Multiplied the left-hand side by three halves, multiplied the right-hand side by three halves, which is a very reasonable thing to do. We're doing the same thing to both sides, multiplying by three halves. And then when we go over here, let's see, three halves times one-sixth. We could divide the numerator and the denominator by three. So it's gonna be one over two. So that indeed is going to be one half times one half, which is one-fourth, so that checks out."
Math,"And on this side, if you multiply three halves times two-thirds, that's going to be one, so this checks out. So it actually looks like Marina did everything correctly. So no mistake, no mistake for Marina. Let's do one last example. So here, Taylor is trying to solve an equation. And so where did Taylor first get tripped up? N minus 2.7 is equal to 6.7. In order to isolate this N over here, I would add 2.7 to both sides, but that's not what Taylor did. Taylor subtracted 2.7 from both sides."
Math,"So the first place that Taylor starts to trip up, or move in the wrong direction is right over here. Now, what Taylor did is not algebraically incorrect. You would end up with n minus 5.4 is equal to four, but it's not going to help you solve this equation. You just replaced this equation with another equivalent equation that is no simpler than the one before. And then of course, instead of getting n minus 5.4 equals four, Taylor calculated incorrectly as well."
Math,"But where they first started to get tripped up, or at least not move in the right direction would be right over here.."
Math,"Each box of pizza costs $8.50. Select the equation that matches this situation. So before I even look at these, let's see if I can make sense of the sentence here. So for $42.50 total, and I'll just write 42.5, especially because in all these choices they didn't write 42.50, they just wrote 42.5 which is equivalent."
Math,"So 42.50 that's the total amount they spent on pizza and if I wanted to figure out how many boxes of pizza they could buy, I could divide the total amount they spend, I could divide that by the price per box. That would give me the number of boxes. So this is the total, total dollars. This right over here is the dollar per box and then this would give me the number of boxes. # of boxes. Now other ways that I could think about it."
Math,"I could say, well what's the total that they spend? So 42.50, but what's another way of thinking about the total they spend? Well you could have the amount they spend per box, times the number of boxes. So this is the total they spend and this another way of thinking about the total they spend, so these two things must be equal. So let's see, if I can see anything here that looks like this, well actually this first choice, this, is exactly, is exactly what I wrote over here."
Math,"Let's see this choice right over here. P is equal to 8.5 x 42.5. Well we've already been able to write an equation that has explicitly, that has just a p on one side and so when you solve for just a p on one side, you get this thing over here, not this thing, so we could rule that out. Over here it looks kind of like this, except the p is on the wrong side. This has 8.5p is equal to 42.5, not 42.5p is equal to 8.5."
Math,"If we try to get the p on the other side here, you could divide both sides by p, but then you would get p divided by p is one. You would get 42.5 is equal to 8.5/p which is not true. We have 8.5 times p is equal to 42.5, so this is, this is not going to be the case. One thing to realize, no matter what you come up with, if you came up with this first, or if you came up with this first, you can go between these two with some algebraic manipulations."
Math,"So for example, to go from this blue one to what I wrote in red up here, you just divide both sides by 8.5. So you divide by 8.5 on the left, you divide 8.5 on the right. Obviously to keep the equal sign you have to do the same thing to the left and right, but now you would have 42.5/8.5 is equal to, is equal to p. Which is exactly what we have over there. Let's do one more of these. Good practice. Mr. Herman's class is selling candy for a school fundraiser."
Math,"The class has a goal of raising $500 by selling c boxes of candy. For every box they sell, they make $2.75. Write an equation that the students could solve to figure out how many boxes of candy they need to sell. How many boxes of candy they need to sell. Well there's a couple of ways you could think about it."
Math,"They have a goal of raising $500 and so they want to get a total of $500, and if each box is $2.75, divide the total by the amount they get each per box and then this is going to be equal to the number of boxes that they need to sell. So this we've done. This is an equation that the students could solve to figure out how many boxes of candy they need to sell. Another way you could think about it, it's 2.75 per box times c boxes. This is the total amount of money they will raise. Whoops, this is the amount."
Math,"So this is the amount that they will raise and their goal is that, their goal is to raise $500. So they want this to be equal to $500. So this also could be an equation that the students could solve to figure out how many boxes of candy they need to sell.."
Math,"I encourage you to pause this video and try these numbers out, does zero satisfy this inequality? Does it satisfy this one? Does one satisfy this one? Does it satisfy that one? I encourage you to try these four numbers out on these two inequalities. Assuming you have tried that, let's work through this together. Let's say, if we try out zero on this inequality right over here, let's substitute x with zero. So, we'll have zero plus two needs to be less than or equal to two times zero."
Math,"Is that true? Well, on the left hand side, this is two needs to be less than or equal to zero. Is that true, is two less than or equal to zero? No, two is larger than zero. So this is not going to be true, this does not satisfy the left hand side inequality, let's see if it satisfies this inequality over here. In order to satisfy it, three times zero plus four needs to be greater than five times zero. Well three times zero is just zero, five times zero is zero."
Math,"So four needs to be greater than zero, which is true. So it does satisfy this inequality right over here so zero does satisfy this inequality. Let's try out one. To satisfy this one, one plus two needs to be less than or equal to two. One plus two is three, is three less than or equal than two? No, three is larger than two. This does not satisfy the left hand inequality. What about the right hand inequality right over here? Three times one plus four needs to be greater than five times one."
Math,"So three times one is three, plus four. So seven needs to be greater than five, well that's true. Both zero and one satisfy three x plus four is greater than five x, neither of them satisfy x plus two is less than or equal to two x. Now let's go to the two. I know it's getting a little bit unaligned, but I'll just do it all in the same color so you can tell. Let's try out two here, two plus two needs to be less than or equal to two times two. Four needs to be less than or equal to four."
Math,"Well four is equal to four and it just has to be less than or equal, so this satisfies. This satisfies this inequality. What about this purple inequality? Let's see, three times two plus four needs to be greater than five times two. Three times two is six plus four is ten, needs to be greater than 10. 10 is equal to 10, it's not greater than 10. It does not satisfy this inequality. If this was a greater than or equal to it would have satisfied but it's not. 10 is not greater than 10."
Math,"It would satisfy greater than or equal to because 10 is equal to 10. So two satisfies the left hand one but not the right hand one. Let's try out five. Five plus two needs to be less than or equal to two times five, once again everywhere we see an x, we replace it with a five. Seven needs to be less than or equal to 10. Which is absolutely true, seven is less than 10. So it satisfies less than or equal to."
Math,"Five satisfies this inequality and what you're probably noticing now is that an inequality can have many numbers that satisfy. In fact they sometimes will have nothing that satisfies it and sometimes they might have an infinite number of numbers that satisfy it and you see that right over here. We're just testing out a few numbers. For this left one, zero and one didn't work, two and five did work. This right one, zero and one worked, two didn't work. Let's see what five does."
Math,"In order for five to satisfy it, three times x. Now we're gonna try x being five. Three times five plus four needs to be greater than five times five. Three times five is fifteen, fifteen plus four is nineteen. Nineteen is to be greater than 25, it is not. So five does not satisfy this inequality right over here. Anyway, hopefully you found that fun.."
Math,"And I've read that I should have at least-- let me throw out a number-- 64 ounces of water per day. There's one way I could think about, where I always want to drink more than 64 ounces, so that would be W is greater than 64. W here is the thing that I want to be bigger, so the opening is to the W. W is greater than 64 ounces. How would I depict that? Well, let me do my number line right over here. Let's say that this is 0. This is 64."
Math,"If I wanted to make strictly greater than, so in this situation it's not cool if I just drink exactly 64. That 64 is not greater than 64. I have to drink 64.01 ounces or 0.00001 ounces. It has to be something that is greater than 64. So I'm not going to include 64, but anything greater than that is completely cool. Now, what if I want to loosen things a little bit? It's OK if I drink exactly 64 ounces or more. Well, then I could write W is greater than or equal to 64."
Math,"And the way that I would be depict that on the number line-- and obviously, I'm not showing all the numbers in between-- let's say this is 0, and then we go all the way up to 64. Well, now it's OK if I drink exactly 64 ounces, so I'm going to fill in the circle now. Here I opened it because 64 was not a cool number. Now, 64 is completely OK. I can drink exactly 64 ounces of water in the day or more, and then I just go up the number line just like that.."
Math,"I'll start here at 0, so 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And we could go below 0. We'd have negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4. I could keep going. Now, we want to graph all of the x's that are less than 4, but we're not including 4. It's not less than or equal to 4. It's just less than 4. And to show that we're not going to include 4, what we're going to do is we're going to draw a circle around 4. So this shows us that we're not including 4. If we were including 4, I would make that a solid dot."
Math,"And to show that we're going to do all the values less than 4, we want to shade in the number line below 4, going down from 4, just like that. And then we can just shade in the arrow just like that. So this right here is all of the values less than 4. And you could test it out. Take any value where there's blue. So there's blue over here, negative 2. Negative 2 is definitely less than 4. If you take this value right here, this 2, it's definitely less than 4. 4 is not included because 4 is not less than 4."
Math,It's equal to 4. 5 is not included because 5 is not less than 4..
Math,"Pause this video and see if you can do that. Alright, so we have Eric's height, which we are using the variable capital E for, And how does it compare? It says Eric is shorter than Priti. So Eric's height is going to be less than whatever Priti's height is, which is 158 centimeters. You could think about it on a number line too. If I were to draw a number line like this, and this is 158 centimeters, Priti's height, Eric's is gonna be less than that 'cause he is shorter."
Math,"So it would be all of the values that are to the left of, let me do this in another color, that are less than that. Just like that. Let's do another example. Here we are told that Sydney wears skirts when the temperature is warmer than 25 degrees Celsius. Write an inequality that describes T, the temperatures at which Sydney wears skirts. So again, pause this video and see if you can have a go at that. Alright. So when does Sydney wear skirts? When the temperature is warmer than 25 degrees Celsius."
Math,"Now, warmer means that the temperature is higher than 25 degrees Celsius, or that the temperature is greater than 25 degrees Celsius. And we're using capital T to denote temperature. So we would say capital T, this needs to be higher than 25 degrees, or greater than 25 degrees Celsius. So T is greater than 25. Let's do one last example here. So here we are told that Lola and Hayley are running a race. Lola finishes the race in 53 seconds. Hayley finishes after Lola."
Math,"Write an inequality that represents H, Hayley's finish time in seconds. Pause the video and see if you can think about this. Alright, so how does Hayley compare to Lola? Hayley finishes after Lola. So what does that mean about Hayley's time? Well, that means that Hayley is going to take more time than Lola to finish the race. So whatever Lola's time is, Hayley's time is going to be longer, or more, or greater than."
Math,"So Hayley's time is going to be greater than Lola's time, which is 53 seconds, because Hayley finishes after.."
Math,"Another way that we could rewrite this if we were to divide both sides of this by two, we would get that the number of apples is equal to cost over two. These are equivalent expressions I should say these are equivalent equations, but the way they've been written, make it useful for different scenarios."
Math,"For example, on the left-hand side here, it's really easy to try out different As and then think about how that will affect the cost, and so when it's written like this, we would call the variable that it's easy to try out different values, we would call that the independent variable, independent variable, and then the one that we are essentially solving for that we then spit out a value after we compute using the independent variable, you call that the dependent variable."
Math,"You could view it as, look in this situation, the cost is dependent on the number of apples you choose to eat. Now, when we wrote it over here, this looks a little bit different. Now the number of apples is solved for, and we compute how many apples based on the cost, so this would be a scenario where you have a budget and you tell me what the budget is and I could tell you the number of apples."
Math,"So in this situation, C is the independent variable, and since we have solved for a, a is the dependent variable. This is useful if I give you a number of apples and you want to know the total cost, and this is useful if you have a certain cost and then you want to find out the number of apples.."
Math,"Graph the equation below. So you could look at a couple of your points. You could say, well, look, if I got 0 questions right I'm going to have 0 points. So you could literally graph that point-- if I got 0 questions right, I get 0 points. And then if I get one question right, and the table tells us that, or we could logically think about it, every question I would get right I'm going to get 5 more points. So if I get one question right, I'm going to get 5 more points, and we saw that in our table as well."
Math,"We saw that right over here-- one question, 5 points. We could also plot it two questions, 10 points, any of these. But you only have to do two points to define a line. So it looks like we are actually done here.."
Math,"All right, now let's work through this together. So you might be familiar with the notion that distance is equal to rate times time. For example, if you were to walk at a rate of five kilometers per hour for two hours, you would say five times two, five kilometers per hour, times two hours, would give you 10 kilometers. Now in this situation, they've given us the number of kilometers or the distance in this situation, so in this situation d is equal to 20."
Math,"So 20 is going to be equal to our rate, which we are told is going to be r kilometers per hour, times our time, which is t hours. Now they're asking us for an equation that represents how many hours the walk will take if Amad walks at a constant rate of r. So the way that it's phrased, it sounds like they want us to solve for t, where t is going to be equal to some expression here that deals with r and probably some other things, so if we put in any r here, then we can get the time."
Math,"So if we know what the rate is, if you put that in here, because it's already solved for t, we'll be able to solve for that time. You could think of r as the independent variable that you could try different values out for, and that t is the dependent variable. It's the thing that we have solved for. So let's do that. Let's rewrite this expression here by solving for t and I could do it right over here."
Math,"If I have 20 is equal to rt, if I wanna solve for t, what can I do? Well, I could divide both sides by r. If I do that on the right-hand side, then I'm just left with a t here, because an r divided by r is just one. And on the left, I have 20 over r, so I have t is equal to 20 over r and we're done. This will tell us how many hours Amad will take to walk based on the rate. You give me a rate. I'm just gonna divide 20 by that and I'm going to give you t."
Math,"You might say, why is this useful? Well, this is useful because now that we have it written this way, any time someone gives an r to you, you just take 20 divided by that and it essentially is already gonna solve for what your time is, how long Amad's gonna have to walk. Question two, how many hours will the walk take if Amad walks at a constant rate of 6 kilometers per hour? Well, here is an example of that, where they are giving us the actual rate and they want the time."
Math,"So we just take the 6 and replace it in for r, so we get t is equal to 20 over 6, which is 3 and 1/3 hours, which would be the same thing as 3 hours and 20 minutes, depending on how you wanna view it. Let's do another example here. So here we're told at the end of each day, a restaurant makes soup with whatever amount of vegetable stock is unused that day. Let me re-center this a little bit. The soup recipe calls for 400 milliliters of water for every 500 milliliters of vegetable stock."
Math,"Write an equation that represents how much water the restaurant should use, and we'll use the variable w, with any amount of vegetable stock, v. All right, and then we'll do part two right after that, so let's look at this, 400 milliliters of water for every 500 milliliters of vegetable stock. And so to get my head around this, I like just to think about, let's put a little table here, and so you could say amount of water, let me write it this way, water and vegetable stock, vegetable stock."
Math,"So for every 500 milliliters of vegetable stock, so if you had 500 milliliters of vegetable stock, and I won't write the milliliters, then you're going to have 400 milliliters of water. If you had 1,000 here, which is two times that, well, you're gonna have twice as much water, which is going to be 800. And so you can see this relationship that's forming. No matter what the vegetable stock is, if you essentially take 4/5 of that, that is the amount of water. You take 4/5, that is the amount of water."
Math,"So if you had only 5 milliliters of vegetable stock, you take 4/5, you get the amount of water. So another way to think about it is the water that you need to use is going to be 4/5 of the amount of vegetable stock that you are going to be using, and so actually we just did part one. We wrote an equation that represents how much water the restaurant should use with any amount of vegetable stock and the way that they phrased it, we're solving for w given some v that you might have."
Math,"And since we're solving for w here, we would consider w the dependent variable and v as the independent variable. You can give me different vs and then I can put that into this little equation here, and I can solve for the w, so we've done the first part. If there are 800 milliliters of unused vegetable stock, how much water should the restaurant use to make soup? Well, we can just take this 800 and substitute it in for v to figure that out."
Math,"In this situation, the amount of water to use is 4/5 times 800, and that's going to be, let's see, 800 divided by 5, 100 divided by 5 is 20 and so, and then you're gonna have 8 of those, so it's 160, so this was 160 times 4 is equal to 640 milliliters, and we are done.."
Math,"You just multiply the base times the height. Now, let's look at a parallelogram. And in this parallelogram, our base still has length b and we still have a height h. So when we talk about the height, we're not talking about the length of these sides that, at least, the way I've drawn them, moved diagonally."
Math,"We're talking about if you go from, that's from this side up here and you were to go straight down, if you were to go at a 90 degree angle, if you were to go perpendicularly straight down, you get to this side, that's going to be, that's going to be our height."
Math,"So in a situation like this, when you have a parallelogram, you know it's base and its height, what do we think its area is going to be? So at first, it might seem, well, you know, this isn't as obvious as if we're dealing with a rectangle, but we can do a little visualization that I think will help."
Math,"So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna take a chunk of area from the left hand side, actually this triangle on the left hand side that helps make up the parallelogram and then move it to the right and then we will see something somewhat amazing. So I'm gonna take this, I'm gonna take this little chunk right there. Actually, let me copy it, let me do it a little bit better."
Math,"So this, I'm gonna take that chunk right there and let me cut and paste it, so it's still the same parallelogram, but I'm just gonna move this section of area. Remember we're just thinking about how much, how much is space is inside of the parallelogram. And I'm gonna take this area right over here and I'm gonna move it to the right hand side. And what just happened? What just happened? Let me see if I can move it a little bit better."
Math,"What just happened when I did that? Well, notice it now looks just like my previous rectangle. That just by taking some of the area, by taking some of the area on the left and moving it to the right, I have reconstructed this rectangle. So they actually have the same area. The area of this parallelogram or what used to be the parallelogram before I moved that triangle from the left to the right is also going to be the base times the height. So the area here is also, the area here is also base times height."
Math,"'Cause once again, I just took this chunk of area that was over there and I moved it to the right. So the area of a parallelogram, the area, let me make this look even more like a parallelogram again. The area of a parallelogram is just going to be, if you have the base and the height, it's just going to be the base times the height. So the area for both of these, the area for both of these are just base times height.."
Math,"This side has length six, this side has length five. And we wanna find the missing height. And they gave us the area. So, pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well the key to solving this, is to realize how the area relates to a base and height. An area of a parallelogram, area of a parallelogram is going to be equal to the base, times the height. Now, what's the base in this scenario? Well, you could view this length, right over here as the base."
Math,"Which is also going to be the same as that length. In a parallelogram, opposite sides have the same length. The parallel sides have the same length. So this going to be six. So our base is going to be six. And our height is what we wanna figure out. So that, I will just write as, this is the H that we're trying to figure out. And we know the area. The area is 24 square units. So there we go, we have 24 is equal to six. Is equal to...six times the height."
Math,"So six times what, is equal to 24? Well six times four is equal to 24. So we know that H is going to be equal to four units. H is equal to four units.."
Math,"Now it's not as obvious when you look at the parallelogram, but in that video we did a little manipulation of the area. We said, ""Hey, let's take this little section right over here."" So we took that little section right over there and then we move it over to the right-hand side. And just like that, you see that as long as the base and the height is the same as this rectangle here, I'm able to construct the same rectangle by moving that area over."
Math,"And that's why the area of this parallelogram is base times height. I didn't add or take away area, I just shifted area from the left-hand side to the right-hand side to show you that the area of that parallelogram was the same as this area of the rectangle. It's still going to be base times height. So hopefully that convinces you, that convinces you that the area of a parallelogram is base times height because we're now going to use that to get the intuition for the area of a triangle."
Math,"So let's look at some triangles here. So that is a triangle and we're given the base and the height. And we're gonna try to think about, well what's, what's this area? What's the area of this triangle going to be? And you can imagine it's going to be dependent on base and height. Well, to think about that, let me copy and paste this triangle. So let me copy and then let me paste it. And what I'm gonna do is, so now I have two of the triangles. So this is now going to be twice the area."
Math,"And I'm gonna rotate it around. I'm gonna rotate it around like that, rotate it around like that, and then add it to the original area. And you see something very interesting is happening. I have now constructed a parallelogram. I have now constructed a parallelogram that has twice the area of our original triangle 'cause I have two of our original triangles right over here. You saw me do it. I copied and pasted it and then I flipped it over and I constructed the parallelogram."
Math,"Now why is this interesting? Well, the area of the entire parallelogram, the area of the entire parallelogram is going to be the length of this base, base times this height. You also have the height written on the h upside down over here was going to be base times height. That's gonna be for the parallelogram, for the entire, lemme draw a parallelogram right over here. That's gonna be the area of the entire parallelogram."
Math,"So what would be the area of our original triangle? What would be the area of our original triangle? Well, we already saw that this area of the parallelogram, it's twice the area of our original triangle. So our original triangle is just going to have half the area. So this area right over here is going to be one half the area of the parallelogram, one half base, lemme do those same colors. One half base times height, one half base times height."
Math,"And you might say, ""Okay, maybe it worked for this triangle, but I wanna see it work for more triangles."" And so to help you there, I've added another triangle right over here. You could view this as an obtuse triangle. This angle right over here is greater than 90 degrees. But I'm gonna do the same trick. We have the base and then we have the height here. You can think of if you start at this point right over here and if you drop a ball, the length that the ball goes."
Math,"Or if you had a string here to kinda get to the ground level, you could view this as the ground level right over there. That that's going to be the height. It's not sitting in the triangle like we saw last time, but it's still the height of the triangle. If this was a building of some kind, you say, ""Well, this is the height. How far off the ground is it?"" Well, what's the area of this going to be? Well you can imagine, it's gonna be one half base times height."
Math,"How do we feel good about that? Well, let's do the same magic here. So let me copy and paste this. So I'm gonna copy and then paste it. Whoops, that didn't work. Let me, so let me copy and then paste it. And so I have two of these triangles now, but I'm gonna flip this one over so that I can construct a parallelogram. So I'm gonna flip it over and move it over here. I'm gonna have to rotate it a little bit more. So I think you get the general idea."
Math,"So now I've constructed a parallelogram that has twice the area of our original triangle. It has twice the area of our original triangle. And so if I talked about the area of the entire parallelogram, it would be, it would be base times the height of the parallelogram, base times the height of the parallelogram. But if we're only talking about the area of, if we're only, if we're only talking about this area right over here, which is our original triangle, it's gonna be half the area of the parallelogram."
Math,So it's gonna be one half of that. So our area of our original triangle is one half base times height. So hopefully that makes you feel pretty good about this formula that you will see in geometry. That area of a triangle is one half base times height while the area of a rectangle or a parallelogram is going to be base times height..
Math,"So we know that the area of a triangle is going to be equal to 1/2 times our base times our height. Let me do the height in a different color. Times, times our height. So, what is the length of our base in this scenario? Well, the base is this 18 right over here. Let me highlight it. This length right over here is our base. So the base is 18. And what is the height? Well, the height, we see, is six. They give it to us. They don't always give it to you, but in this example they do."
Math,"So the height is, the height... The height is, I'm having trouble with my pen, is six. So now we just have to compute what 1/2 times 18 times six is. Well, let's think about this a little bit. Well, 1/2 times 18 is nine. Nine times six is equal to what? Nine times six is equal to 54. And we are done. This is 54 square units.."
Math,"Alright, now let's work through this together. They give us the area, they give us this side, right over here, this 11, they give us this length 10, which if we rotate this triangle, you could view it as an altitude. And in fact, let me do that. Let me rotate this triangle because then I think it might jump out at you how we can tackle this. So let me copy and let me paste it. So if I move it here, but I'm gonna rotate it."
Math,"So if I rotate the, oh, that is our rotated triangle and now it might be a little bit clearer what we're talking about. This length x that we want to figure out. This is our base and they give us our height and they give us our area. And we know how base, height and area relate for a triangle. We know that area is equal to 1/2 times the base times the height. And they tell us, they tell us that our area is 75 unit squared. So this is 75 is equal to 1/2. What is our base? Our base is the variable x."
Math,"So let's just write that down. 1/2 times x. And then what is our height? Well, our height is actually the 10. If x is the length of our base, then the height of our triangle is gonna be 10. We actually don't even need to use this 11. They're putting that there just to distract you. So this is going to be our height, times 10. So 75 is equal to 1/2 times x times 10. Or lemme just rewrite it this way."
Math,"We could say 75 is equal to 1/2 times 10 is equal to 5 times x, is equal to 5 times, lemme do the x in that same color is equal to 5 times x. So what is x going to be? There's a couple of ways you could think about it. You could say 5 times what is equal to 75 and you might be able to figure that out. You might say, okay, let's see, 5 times 10 is 50. And then let's see, I need another 25. So I'd put another 5 there. So it's really 5 times 15. Or you could do it a little bit more systematically."
Math,"You can divide both sides by what you're multiplying by x. So if you divide this side by 5, 5 times x divided by 5, well you're just going to have an x leftover. But you can't, these two things were equal. So you can't just do it to one side, you have to do it to both sides. So you have to divide both sides by 5. And what's 75 divided by 5? Well that is 15. So you get x is equal to, x is equal to 15."
Math,"And you can verify that, if x is equal to 15, base times height, times 1/2, well it's 15 times 10 times 1/2 or 15 times 5, which is going to be 75 square units.."
Math,"then we know from here to here is two, and then from here to here is seven, and then they're giving us this dimension right over here is 3.5. And so given that, let's see if we can find the area of this entire figure. And I encourage you to pause the video right now and try this on your own. So I assume you've given a go at it and there might be a few things that jump out at you immediately."
Math,"The first thing is that they have these two triangles up here and they give us all of the dimensions for 'em, or at least they give us the base and the height for it, which is enough to figure out the area. If I had a triangle or if I had a rectangle that was 2 X 3.5 or two wide, two units wide and 3.5 units high. If had a rectangle like that, we know that it would have an area of 2 X 3.5."
Math,"Now a triangle is just going to be, or especially a triangle like this, a right triangle is just gonna be half of a rectangle like this. We just care about half of its area. So this area is going to be 1/2 X 2 X 3.5. And 1/2 X 2 = 1, 1 X 3.5 is 3.5 square units. So the area of that part is going to be 3.5 square units. Now let's think about the area of this triangle right over here. Well, once again, we have its height as 3.5, its base is seven. So its area is going to be 1/2 X 7 X 3.5."
Math,"1/2 X 7 is 3.5 X 3.5, so this part is 3.5, and then I'm gonna multiply that times 3.5 again. So let's figure out what that product is equal to. So 3.5 X 3.5. 5 X 5 is 25. 3 X 5 is 15 + 2 is 17. Let's cross that out, move one place over to the left. 3 X 5 is 15. 3 X 3 is 9 + 1 is 10. So that gets us to 5 + 0 is five, 7 + 5 is 12. Carry the one, 1 + 1 is two, and we have a one. And we have two digits to the right of the decimal."
Math,"One, two, so we're gonna have two digits to the right of the decimal in the answer. So the area here is 12.25 square units. Now this region might seem a little bit more maybe, maybe a little bit more difficult because it's kind of a, it's this weird trapezoid-looking thing. But one thing that might pop out at you is that you can divide it very easily into a rectangle and a triangle. And we can actually figure out the dimensions that we need to figure out the areas of each of these."
Math,"We know what the width of this rectangle is, right? Or the length of this rectangle, whatever you want to call it. It's going to be two units plus seven units. So this is going to be nine. We know that this distance is 3.5. So if this distance right over here is 3.5, then this distance down here has to add up with 3.5 to 6.5. So this must be three. So now we can actually figure out the area. So the area of this rectangle is just going to be its height times its length, or 9 X 3.5. 9 X 3.5."
Math,"And one way you could do it, we could even try to do this in our head. This is gonna be 9 X 3 + 9 X 0.5. So 9 X 3 is 27. 9 X 0.5, that's just half of nine, so it's gonna be 4.5. 27 + 4 would get us to 31. So that's going to be equal to 31.5. Or you could multiply it out like this if you like. But the area of this region is 31.5. And then the area of this triangle right over here, it's gonna be 9 X 3 X 1/2, we're looking at a triangle. 9 X 3 is 27, 27 X 1/2 is 13.5."
Math,"And so to find the area of the entire thing, we just have to sum up these areas. So we have 31.5, 31.5 + 13.5, 13.5, plus 12.25, 12.25, plus 3.5, plus 3.5 here. So we just have a five here in the hundredths. That's the only one. 5 + 5 is 10 + 7 is 17. 1 + 1 is 2 + 3 is 5 + 2 is 7 + 3 is 10. 1 + 3 is 4 + 1 is 5 + 1 is six. So we get a total area for this figure of 60.75 square units.."
Math,"And we know that this side and this side that they're parallel to each other. You can see that they both form right angles with this dotted line. So pause this video and see if you can find the area. All right. Now, if you had a little bit of trouble with that I'll give you a hint. What if we were to take this quadrilateral and divide it into two triangles? So let me do this in a color that you are likely to see. So if I were to draw a line like this it now divides the quadrilateral into two triangles."
Math,"If I were to take this triangle right over here I could take it out and reorient it, so it looks something like this, where the base has length 8, and then the height right over here, the height this has length 5. So that would be that triangle. And then, this triangle over here if you were to take it out and reorient it a little bit it could look like this, where the base is 4, and the triangle looks something like, looks something like this. So the base is 4, and then the height is going to be 5."
Math,"So this height right over here, this height, we notice this is a right angle. So from here to here, which is the same thing as from here to right over here, we know that this is 5. So that's my fairly big hint to you, if you know how to find the area of a triangle. The area of a triangle we know is 1/2 base times height. So the area of this one right over here is gonna be 1/2 times 8 times 5. And the area of this one over here is going to be 1/2 times the base, which is 4 times the height, which is 5."
Math,"And we could evaluate each of these, or we could just add them together. That the area of the entire thing is going to be 1/2 times this base right over here which is 8, times the height, which is 5, plus 1/2 times this side, you could do that as the other base, times 4 times that same height, times 5. And obviously, you could just evaluate this or we could see some interesting things about it. We could express this as well if we were to factor out 1/2 and the 5 here."
Math,"This could be rewritten as 1/2, 1/2 times 8 plus 4, 8 plus 4. And then, all of that, all of that times 5 right over here. And so, another way you could think about it is the average of the length of these two bases. You could view this as base 1 and base 2, you multiply that times the height and you have the area of this quadrilateral. Well, what's that going to be? 8 plus 4 is 12. 1/2 times 12, this is all going to be 6. 6 times 5 is going to be equal to 30 square units."
Math,"You could have figured it out here too. 1/2 times 8 is 4, times 5 is 20. And then, this would've been 1/2 times 4 is 2, times 5 is 10. 20 plus 10 is 30 square units once again.."
Math,"Then we'll do one more problem. So let's figure out what are the coordinates of these points? So you have this point right here, A. So its x-coordinate, you can see it right there. You just drop down. Where does it intersect the x-axis? x is equal to 5. So it's the point 5 comma and y is going to be equal to 6. 5 comma 6. Now this point B here, what's the x-coordinate? It is 5 to the left. 5 to the left of the x-axis. This is negative 5. Its x-coordinate is negative 5."
Math,"y-coordinate is, if you just go straight to the right, you're going to hit y is equal to 5. y is equal 5. Let me switch colors. I think you're getting the hang of this. Let's do the y-coordinate first. The y-coordinate is 3. You see that right there. And then the x-coordinate is negative 2. Negative 2. You always put the x-coordinate first. That's just the convention we use. D, x-coordinate negative 2. You see that right there. y-coordinate negative 2, as well. Let me get another color."
Math,"E, let's do the y-coordinate. We'll figure it out first, but you always have to write it second. It's negative 4. You see that right there, the y-coordinate. The x-coordinate is 3. And then finally, F. The x-coordinate is 2. And the y-coordinate is negative 6. Hopefully that gives you a sense of at least figuring out the coordinates. Now let's go the other way. Let's start with coordinates and figure out where those points are. So you have this first one."
Math,"I'll do it lowercase case a in parentheses to differentiate it from this uppercase A. So it's at 4 comma 2. x is equal to 4. y is equal to 2. So that's that point right there. Let's do the next one. Let me do it in a color that you'll be able to read. x is equal to negative 3. y is equal to 5.5. So you go all the way up to 5.5. y is equal to 5.5. So that is the point lowercase b with parentheses around it. Then c, 4 negative 4. x is equal to 4. y is equal to negative 4. Right over there."
Math,"And then one last one. I'll do it in orange. d, x is negative 2, y is negative 3. Right there. That's the d with parentheses. And you could have gone the other way. You could have said, hey, y is equal to negative 3. x is equal to negative 2. So you could go to the left and down. Or you could go down and to the left. And you're still going to get to the same point. So hopefully that gives you a good sense of how to figure out coordinates."
Math,"Or if you're given coordinates, how to figure out where to plot something on the x,y-coordinate plane. Now let's do a slightly more involved problem. So it says the following 3 points are 3 vertices of square A, B, C, D. Plot them on a graph. Then determine what the coordinates of the fourth point, D, would be. All right, let's plot these on a graph, as they tell us to do. All right. That'll be my y-axis. That's my y-axis. The vertical axis. That'll be my x-axis. And let me put some-- let me mark it."
Math,"So that's x equals 1, 2, 3, 4. This is x is equal to negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4. That's y is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4. This is y is equal to negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4. I could write that this y equals 4. This y equals negative 4. x is equal to 4. x is equal to negative 4. And let's see. Let's plot these points. So first, we have the point A is equal to negative 4, negative 4. So we go x is negative 4. And then y is negative 4. So we drop down 4 right there."
Math,"And that is our point A. Negative 4, negative 4. And just to familiarize yourself with a labeling scheme that you may or may not have seen before, is that people label these sections of the coordinate plane. They call this the first quadrant. They call this the second quadrant. They call this the third quadrant. And they call this the fourth quadrant. And these are just the Roman numerals for I, II, III, and IV, So this point is in the third quadrant."
Math,"When we looked up at this stuff over here, these points are in the fourth quadrant. These are in the third, second, first. Just an interesting thing to know. Sometimes someone might ask you, what quadrant is that point in? And you just say, OK, I see. If they're both negative, they're going to be in the third quadrant. If just the y is negative, but the x is positive, you're going to be in the fourth. If they're both positive, you're in the first. If y is positive, but x is negative, you're in the second."
Math,"And we'll talk a little bit about that as we plot these points. So point B, x is positive. It's 1, 2, 3. And y is negative 4. So we drop down here into the fourth quadrant. That is the point B. It's 3, negative 4. So we can already see the bottom of our rectangle that they're talking about, right there. And notice, both of these have the exact same y. They're both at the same level below the x-axis. And then what's the next point? Point C is 3 comma 3. So 3 comma 3. It's in the first quadrant."
Math,"Both of its coordinates are positive. 3 comma 3. Both x and y are positive. And notice, it's on the same vertical as B. It has the same x value. They both have an x value of 3. So it's right above it. Right above it. Now we have to figure out the last point here. Well, the point is going to have to be on the same vertical as this point. It's going to have to be on the same vertical as this point, which means it's going to have the same x value as this point. So its x value is going to be negative 4."
Math,"And then it's going to have to be on the same horizontal as this point. It's going to have to be on the same horizontal as that point. So it's going to have to have the same y value at the same height above the x-axis. So it's going to have to be 3. So that is our point D. Notice it's at negative 4, right above A. And it's at y is equal to 3. Right to the left of point C. And we are done.."
Math,"The vertical axis here is the y-axis. And the convention, when we get an ordered pair like this, is that the first coordinate is the x-coordinate, and the second coordinate is the y-coordinate. So they're telling us that we have an x-coordinate of 6. That means we count up 6 on the x-axis. So let's count up 1. I could even write it down-- 1, and then we have 2. That's right there. Then we have 3. Then we have 4. Then we have 5. And then we've moved up 6 along the x-axis. We started at the origin, at 0, 0."
Math,"That's the origin. And we moved 6 to the right. That's this part right over here. Now, our y-coordinate is negative 8. That means we move down 8 in the vertical direction. So we can see it right over here. So this right here, I'll just do that every two. So this is down 1. This right here is negative 2, negative 3. This right here is negative 4, negative 5, negative 6, negative 7, negative 8. So we move to the right 6, and then we move down 8."
Math,"We move to the right 6, and then we move down 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. And we are right over there. So that is the point , 6 negative 8. You could also look at it this way. The x-coordinate is 6. So you move 6 there. And so we're going to be along this line right over here. And then you can go, and then the y-coordinate is negative 8. So you go down to negative 8. And you say, we're going to be along this line over here. And the place that they intersect is this coordinate."
Math,"The easiest way I'd like to think of it, move 6 to the right, move along the x-axis, and then move along in the vertical direction along the y-axis. So you go down 8.."
Math,"So 3 comma negative 2, well, actually, that looks like that first one is not graphed. So 3 comma negative 2 isn't graphed. And you can verify that all of these others do seem to be graphed. 4 comma negative 8 is right there. Negative 8 comma 3 is right over here. 4 comma 6 is right there. And negative 1 comma 0 is right there. So let's do a couple more of these. So is negative 5 comma 0 graphed? It's right over there. Negative 4 comma positive 5 should be there. So that's not graphed."
Math,"So let me just select that one. Let's do one more of these. Negative 8 comma 4, so negative 8 comma 4, we got lucky. The first one is not graphed-- negative 8 comma 4. And we're done.."
Math,"And you can see it divides a coordinate plane into four sections. We call each of these sections quadrants. This one over here, where both the x-values and the y-values are positive, we call the first quadrant. And we use the Roman numeral I. Then if we kind of move counterclockwise around the coordinate plane, this quadrant where the x-values are negative and the y-values are positive, we call this the second quadrant. I could write it. We call this the second quadrant."
Math,"Then we go down here where both the x-values are negative and the y-values are negative. We call this the third quadrant, once again using Roman numerals. Then finally the quadrant where the x-values are positive but the y-values are negative, we call this the fourth quadrant. So let's see which quadrant the point negative 7 comma 7 is located. So there's two ways to think about it. You could just say, look, we have a negative x-value. Our x-value is negative, so we're going to move to the left."
Math,"So we're going to be on this side. We're going to be on this side right here of the coordinate plane. Just by the fact that the x-value is negative, we're going to be either in the second or the third quadrant. Now, we know that the y-value is positive. We know that the y-value is positive. So if the x-value is negative and the y-value is positive, we're going to land someplace right over here in the second quadrant."
Math,"The other way to think about it is you could literally just plot this point and see that it falls in the second quadrant. So let's do that. If x is negative 7. So that's negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6, negative 7. Did I do that right? 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6, 7. So this is x is negative 7. And then we have to go up 7 because y is equal to positive 7. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7. So the point negative 7 comma 7 is right over here, clearly lies in the second quadrant.."
Math,"It's a positive 4. So I'm going to go 4 to the right. And then the second coordinate says, what do we do in the vertical direction or in the y-direction? It's a negative 1. Since it's negative, we're going to go down. And it's a negative 1, so we're going to go down 1. So that right over there is the point 4 comma negative 1. So I've plotted it, but now I have to select which quadrant the point lies in. And this is just a naming convention. This is the first quadrant. This is the second quadrant."
Math,"This is the third quadrant. And this is the fourth quadrant. So the point lies in the fourth quadrant, quadrant IV. And I guess you have to know your Roman numerals a little bit to know that's representing quadrant IV. Let's do a couple more of these. Plot 8 comma negative 4, and select the quadrant in which the point lies. Well, my x-coordinate is 8 so I go 8 in the positive x-direction. And then my y-coordinate is negative 4, so I go 4 down."
Math,"And this is sitting, again, in not the first, not the second, not the third, but the fourth quadrant, in quadrant IV. Let's do one more of these. Hopefully we get a different quadrant. So we want to plot the point negative 5 comma 5. So now my x-coordinate is negative. It's negative 5. So I'm going to move to the left in the x-direction. So I go to negative 5. And my y-coordinate is positive so I go up 5, so negative 5 comma 5. And this is sitting not in the first quadrant, but the second quadrant."
Math,"And of course, this is the third and the fourth. So this is sitting in the second quadrant. Check answer, and we got it right.."
Math,"Plot the two points, and find the distance between Milena's home and the mall. So let's see, she's riding her bicycle from her home at the point negative 3, 4. So let's plot negative 3, 4. So I'll use this point right over here. So negative 3 is our x-coordinate. So we're going to go 3 to the left of the origin 1, 2, 3. That gets us a negative 3. And positive 4 is our y-coordinate. So we're going to go 4 above the origin. Or I should say, we're going to go 4 up."
Math,"So we went negative 3, or we went 3 to the left. That's negative 3, positive 4. Or you could say we went positive 4, negative 3. This tells us what we do in the horizontal direction. This tells us what we do in the vertical direction. That's where her home is. Now let's figure out where the mall is. It's at the point negative 3, negative 7. So negative 3, we went negative 3 along the horizontal direction and then negative 7 along the vertical direction. So we get to negative 3, negative 7 right over there."
Math,"And now we need to figure out the distance between her home and the mall. Now, we could actually count it out, or we could just compute it. If we wanted to count it out, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 blocks. So we could type that in. And another way to think about it is they have the exact same x-coordinate. They're both at the x-coordinate negative 3. The only difference between these two is what is happening in the y-coordinate. This is at a positive 4. This is at a negative 7."
Math,"Positive 4, negative 7. So we're really trying to find the distance between 4 and negative 7. So if I were to say 4 minus negative 7, we would get this distance right over here. So we have 4 minus negative 7, which is the same thing as 4 plus 7, which is 11. Let's do a couple more. Carlos is hanging a poster in the area shown by the red rectangle. He is placing a nail in the center of the blue line. In the second graph, plot the point where he places the nail."
Math,"So he wants to place a nail in the center of the blue line. The blue line is 6 units long. The center is right over here. That's 3 to the right, 3 to the left. So he wants to put the nail at the point x equals 0, y is equal to 4. So he wants to put it at x is equal to 0, y is equal to 4. That's this point right over here. So let's check our answer. Let's do one more. Town A and Town B are connected by a train that has a station at the point negative 1, 3. I see that. The train tracks are in blue."
Math,"Fair enough. Which town is closer to the station along the train route, Town A or Town B? So they're not just asking us what's the kind of crow's flight, the distance that if you were to fly. They're saying, which town is closer to the station along the train route? So if you were to follow the train route just like that. So the A right over here, A if you were going along the train route, you would have to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the x-direction, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 along the y-direction."
Math,"So you'd have to go a total of 11. If you're going from B, you're going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 9, 10, 11 along the x-direction, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so 6 along the vertical direction. So you're going to go a total 17. So it's pretty obvious that A is closer along the tracks. Now, you could also think about it in terms of coordinates because A is at the coordinate of negative 7, 8."
Math,"And if you were to think about negative 7, 8, to get from negative 7 to negative 1 along the x-coordinate, you're going to go 6. And then to go from 8 to 3, you're going to go 5 more. So you could also not necessarily count it out, you can actually just think about the coordinates. But either way, you see that town A is closer.."
Math,"So one is at the point 0,9. So our x-coordinate is 0, so we're at 0, and then our y-coordinate or our vertical coordinate is 9. So we have to have, we need to have a vertex right over here. Now the next one is at 0,-7. So 0,-7. So lemme just put something here. We can later rearrange it to see what actually makes sense. Then we have 8,-7. So 8,-7. 8,-7 is right over here. It feels like this might be the right edge. So I'll put its other point right at 8,-7. And then finally, 8,0."
Math,"Well, 8,0 is right over here. So it looks like I have a point on every one of the vertices. So now I just have to connect to these two and I'll have a four-sided figure. So let me take this there, bring this one over, and then let me move this one up, and then bring this one down, and there you have it. I think I've got my quadrilateral.."
Math,"So let me write the base of the parallelogram times the height of the parallelogram. Times the height of the parallelogram. Area is equal to base times height. So what could we consider to be the base of this parallelogram? Well, we could imagine it to be one of these sides. So we could go from here, and so I could say, well, I could consider this to be the base. And so what's the length of that base? Well, we're just going in the vertical direction."
Math,"We go from y equals five to y is equal to negative seven. So this has length 12. We have five above the x-axis and seven below the x-axis, adding up to 12. Or you could count it, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. So this is our base. And we could say that base is equal to 12. And now what could we view as our height? Well, we could view this dimension right over here as our height. And what is that going to be? Well, you can see very clearly that the height is equal to four."
Math,"And this might be a little counterintuitive, 'cause normally when you're talking about height, you're used to thinking about how high something is. But you can imagine rotating this around so that this is laying, the base is laying flat and then the height is the height in the traditional sense of the word. But we could say h is equal to four. And now it's pretty straightforward. Our area is going to be equal to 12, the length of our base, times our height, times four, times four, which is clearly just 48."
Math,"48 whatever, square, 48 square units.."
Math,"Let's just plot these, the three vertices that they give us. So it looks like they're all in the first quadrant. So I'm gonna focus my coordinate axes on the first quadrant. So that's going to be my y-axis. And let me now, that's gonna be my x-axis. And let's see, the highest x value that I have, we have a 2, I have a 5, I have a 5. It looks like it goes up to 5. So I could say and 5. So that's 5. I can just number them 1, 4, and 5. And let's see the highest y value of 1, 1, and a 6. It goes up to 6."
Math,"and 6. I can number them and 6. Now let's plot the points. So let's first plot point A, which is at 2,1. x equals 2, y is equal to 1. So that's that point right over there. Now let's plot point B. Point B is at 5,1. So x equals 5, y is equal to 1. That's right over there. Now let's plot point C. Point C, and you can find another color here, point C is at x is equal to 5, y is equal to 6. x is equal to 5, y is equal to 6. So it sticks us roughly right over there."
Math,"And so we need to figure out what D is going to be. Well, D is going, this is a rectangle, the sides are parallel, all the vertices, we have right angles at all the vertices. So point D is going to have the same, the same x-coordinate as this point right over here. So it's gonna have the same x-coordinate, and so it's going to have an x-coordinate, so lemme write this, D is gonna have an x-coordinate of 2, and it's gonna have the same y-coordinate as this point up here."
Math,"So it's gonna have a y-coordinate of 6, So D is going to be at the point 2,6. And you see when we do that, we have set up a nice, a nice rectangle here. And we can draw the rectangle. So that's one side, that's the top side, that's another side, another side, and then we have that just like that. There you go. We have our rectangle. But most importantly, we answered our question: What are the coordinates of point D? All right.."
Math,"And so let's just go point by point and plot the green points at those points. So the first one is one comma one. And remember the first coordinate is our X coordinate. The second coordinate is our Y coordinate. So the first coordinate tells us how far do we move to the right of the origin. So it's one, and then the second coordinate, the Y coordinate, tells us how far to move up from the origin. So that's also a one. So one comma one. The next point is one comma six. X coordinate is one."
Math,"So we move one to the right of the origin, and then the Y coordinate is six. So we move six up and notice it's at the intersection of the line, or it's at the intersection of when Y equals six and X equals one. This is one comma six, all right. Now we have nine comma six. So let's see if we take our, if we have X equals nine right over there and Y is equal to six. So we'd go up six. So notice Y is now equal to six. And we have one last point to plot, nine comma one. So when X is nine, Y is one."
Math,"We go nine to the right, or we're right above X equals nine. And then we go up one. This is nine comma one. And there you have it. We have the four corners of our rectangle. Then they say what is the height of the rectangle? Well, if you imagine a rectangle right over here, the height would be the distance between that point and this point, or the distance between that point and that point. And so what is the distance between these points? Let's see."
Math,"They both have the same X coordinate and this one is at Y equals six. This is at Y equals one. So this is five higher than this one. So the height is five. And we could also count it. You could see one, two, three, four, five.."
Math,"That's one way that we could tackle it. So let's, let me see all of these are actually in the first coordinate. So I can focus on the first coordinate. So let's say that's my y-axis. That's my y-axis. And let me draw my x-axis, my x-axis. And actually I wanna really focus in on the points A and D because we just need to find the length of the side from point A to point D. So point A, lemme just use another color, so point A is at x equals 7, y is equal to 1. 7, so that's x equals 7. y is equal to 1."
Math,"y is equal to 1, so that is point A right over there, point A, let me label it, point A. And then where's point D? Point D has the exact same, has the exact same x-coordinate, but its y-coordinate is a little bit higher. Its y-coordinate is 6, it's actually 5 higher. So point D is that x equals 7, y is equal to 6. So y is equal to 1, and 6. So that's y is equal to 6. And so we can draw the point. It is going to be right over here."
Math,"This is point D, and we can actually connect them with a line if we like to show that this is a side of a rectangle. So let me draw that. I can just draw this like this. And there you have it. I haven't even drawn the whole rectangle yet, but just by plotting these two points, we can think about how long side AD is. We can see, look, the x doesn't change going from A to D, but we do increase in the y direction by 5. We go from y is equal to 1 to y is equal to 6. So our change in y is equal to 5."
Math,"So what's the length of this line? Well, it's gonna be 5. It's gonna be 5, whatever the units are. So that's the length of side AD. It's going to be equal to 5. We went from the point 7,1 to the point, to the point 7,6. Now they said that this was a rectangle, now just for satisfaction, we can draw the entire rectangle. We have the point B. That is at x equals 5, y is equal to 1. So let me draw that. And I'm just doing this just for fun now. At this point, we're done with the problem."
Math,"So x equals 5, y equals 1. That's right over here. That's point B. Let me write B, that's the point 5,1. And then we have the point C. I'll use another color. The point C is at x equals 5, y equals 6. x equals 5, y equals 6. Point C is right over here. Point C is the point x equals 5, y equals 6. And then we can connect all the dots if we like and clearly see that it is a rectangle. So I could connect those, I could connect these two, and then I could connect these two."
Math,"And then we see that we indeed have a rectangle. But we answered it a while ago that the length of side AD is equal to 5. If we cared about the other sides, the length of BA, well, this is 2, a difference of 2 along the x direction, the horizontal direction, this difference of 2 along the x direction, difference of 5 in the y direction, we go from y equals 1 to y equals 6. So there you have it. We are actually able to figure out all of the dimensions of this rectangle.."
Math,"Let's look at Y. And this is a little bit counterintuitive because they're using the variable Y to represent the X-coordinate of this point. So let's see if we can figure out what the X-coordinate of this point is. Well, it's a rectangle. The X-coordinate of this point right over here is gonna be the same as the X-coordinate of this point."
Math,"They sit on the same vertical line, the way that it's drawn, so if this has an X-coordinate of X equals four, then this is going to have an X-coordinate of four, and now we use the variable Y for the X-coordinate, which is a little strange, but this is going to be the point (4,7). So Y is equal to four. Now let's see what we could figure out about Z. Well, Z is the Y-coordinate for, let me use another color here. Z is the Y-coordinate for this point."
Math,"Now what other point has the same Y-coordinate? Well, it's gonna be at the same level, I guess you could say in the vertical direction. It's gonna sit on the same horizontal line. So it's gonna have the same Y-coordinate as this point. Now this point has a Y-coordinate of three, so this point's Y-coordinate needs to be three or we could say that Z is equal to three. So this is going to be equal to three. And then last but not least, we need to figure out what X is. And X is the X-coordinate."
Math,"Let me just in another color. X is the X-coordinate for this point. Well, this X-coordinate is gonna be the same thing as the X-coordinate for this point up here, which is equal to two. They sit on the same vertical line, they both sit on the line X equals two. And so X is going to be two. It is the X-coordinate and it is also the variable X, so this is going to be two. If we wanna sort them from least to greatest, X is the least, then we would go, it's actually the exact opposite of what we have here."
Math,"It'd be X, then Z, then Y. Two, then three, then four. So actually lemme get the exercise out and just check our answer. So X is the least, then Z is in the middle and then Y is the largest. We could check our answer and we got it right.."
Math,"So vertex A is at the point one comma one. So one comma one, it puts us right over there. That is vertex A. Vertex C is at the point 4.5 comma four. So 4.5 along the horizontal axis, comma four, comma four. So we go all the way, we go all the way up to, all the way up to four. So that right over there is point C. Point D is that negative 1.5 comma four, so negative 1.5 along the horizontal, or I guess we know the x-axis, we could say. Negative 1.5 comma four, so four along the vertical or the y-axis."
Math,"So we go right up, go right over there. That's close enough. So that of course is our y-axis. This is point D. And we need to figure out what are the coordinates of point B if B must be in Quadrant 1. And they tell us that the distance from A to B must be the same as the length of segment D to C, and both are horizontal. So let's draw what we know to draw. So DC, segment DC, segment DC is this segment right over here, is this segment right over here. And we see it's horizontal."
Math,"Both of the vertical coordinates are four at both vertex D and vertex C. So both of the vertical coordinates are four. Now what is the length of this? Because we're gonna have to construct another segment that has the same length. Well, along the horizontal direction, we went from negative 1.5 to 4.5. So how far did we go? Well, to go from negative 1.5 to zero, you go 1.5 and then you have to go another 4.5. So this is going to be 4.5 plus 1.5, which is equal to four plus one is 5, .5 plus .5 is one."
Math,"So five plus one is six. So this distance right over here is six of our units. Another way of thinking about it, and actually let me put the coordinates in here just so it becomes a little bit clearer. This was the point four point... Lemme do that in something easier to see. This right over here is the point 4.5 comma four. And this right over here is the point negative 1.5 comma four."
Math,"And so another way of thinking about this distance is you could take the end point, and we're really thinking about the distance just along, it's a horizontal line, so the y value does not change. It doesn't change in the vertical direction, only the horizontal."
Math,"So you really wanna say, well, how far is, if you start at negative 1.5 and you get to 4.5, how far have you gone? So you can just take your end point, your end value, your end horizontal value, your end x value, and from that you can subtract your starting x value. So you subtract negative 1.5. And this of course is equal to 4.5 plus positive 1.5, which once again is equal to six. So, fair enough, and lemme draw some of the rest of the polygon just so that we see it is indeed a polygon."
Math,"So we have this side right over here, and it looks like it's gonna be a parallelogram. So we have this side right over here and we have to replace point B. And point B is gonna be someplace out here. It's going to have the same vertical value or the same y value is point A. So its y-coordinate is going to be one. So point B is going to be out here someplace, point, lemme just in a new color. So point point B. I haven't used this orange yet. Actually, I have used the orange yet. I haven't used the yellow."
Math,"No, I've used the yellow. Let's see, I haven't used this green. Point B is going to be someplace out here. So point B is gonna be someplace out here. We already know what its y-coordinate is. It's a horizontal line, so it's gonna have to have the same exact y-coordinate as point A. Point A's y-coordinate was one. So this is going to have to have a y-coordinate of one. Now the big question is, what is its x-coordinate going to be? Well, it's going to have to be... Let me do that in a different color."
Math,"It's going to have to be whatever A's x-coordinate was. It's gonna have to be whatever A's x-coordinate was. And we see that A's x-coordinate was one. It's gonna have to be that plus six 'cause we're gonna move the same distance in the horizontal direction. This thing has to be six. So if we start at one, we add six, we get to seven. So what are the coordinates of point B? And especially if point B must be in Quadrant 1. And notice we are definitely in Quadrant 1."
Math,"This is Quadrant 1, this is Quadrant 2, this is Quadrant 3, and this is Quadrant 4. Coordinate for point B is seven comma one.."
Math,"So we have this face over, whoops. Let me do it in this other tool. So you have this face over here in the back. So that's one face. So that's one. Then you have this face right over here. Also in the back. The only way we can see this is because they've drawn it so that it is transparent. So that is the second face. Now you have this triangular face on top. So let me color that in. So you have this triangular face on top. So that that's going to be our third face. Third face."
Math,"And then you have this triangular face on the bottom. That's gonna be our fourth face. And that's going to be our fourth face. And then the key question is, are we done? It looks like I've colored all the ones that I can see, but there's one a little bit tricky here. There's the one that we are actually seeing through, there's the face, there's, let pick a color. There's the face out front that we can see through so that we can see faces one, two, and four. So that's actually going to be our fifth face."
Math,"The way they've drawn it, it's like it's made out of glass. So we can see faces one, two, and four. But that is our fifth face. And so this thing has five faces. All right, let's do another example. But instead of faces, let's gonna think about, we're gonna think about edges. So how many edges does the following shape have? Pause the video and see if you can work through this. Okay, let's work through this together now. And I'm just gonna count these edges. So the edges are where two faces meet."
Math,"So this is an edge right over there. So that's one edge. There's an edge back here, we can see 'cause it's transparent. That is our second edge. We have this one over here. That is our third edge. We have this one over there. That is our fourth edge. Then we have this one over here. That is our fifth edge. Now we have this here. This is our sixth edge. Let's see. All we have left is this one, which is edge number seven. And then last but not least, this edge over here, which is edge number eight."
Math,"And I actually found this very valuable to color 'em in to make sure that I wasn't missing an edge or double counting an edge. So this thing has eight, eight edges. Actually, if you're curious, just for extra practice, how many faces does this have? Well, we can count those as well. This has one face back there, another face back there. So that's two faces. And then you have a third face, which is the base, this rectangular face. So that's three faces. And then you have your two faces out front."
Math,"You have this face that we're seeing through, and then we have that face that we're seeing through. So even though they're asking edges just for practice, we figured out that this thing has five faces. One for the square base, and then four triangular faces for these sides to make this square pyramid. So it has eight edges and five faces.."
Math,"So first let's start, let's think about which one is the square pyramid. So this shape here on the right clearly looks like a pyramid. And the thing that makes it a square pyramid is the idea that its base is a square. Let me see if I can shade this in. So the base of this right over here is a square. So that's where the square pyramid comes from. If it's a triangular pyramid, then the base would only have three sides, but this is a square pyramid. So let me move this over there."
Math,"So that is a square pyramid. All right, let's do the next one. Which one is a rectangular prism? A prism you can view as a three dimensional object. And since it's saying rectangular prism, well the best one here that is rectangular, notice this shape right over here is rectangular on every side. And it's three dimensions. It is a prism. And so this is the rectangular prism. So let's move that over. So that is our rectangular prism. Now, triangular prism, so this one is interesting."
Math,"If you look at this shape right over here, it has sides that are triangles. You see this up here is a triangle. And you see this down here is a triangle, although they're connected by these rectangular sides. And this is actually what's called a triangular prism. In a square pyramid, the faces which are triangles all meet at a point. In a triangular prism, you have two opposite facing sides that are triangles."
Math,"And you'll see all of these in different orientations, in different, you know, sometimes it'll be resting like this, sometimes it'll be on its side. But this is a triangular prism. Let me- so that is a triangular prism. And so we have two left. You might be able to figure these out. Which one is a sphere? Well, when I think sphere, I think of like a globe. And so this choice right over here is clearly a sphere. So let me move that over. Let me move it over. Okay, so that one is a sphere."
Math,"And then last but not least, a thing that looks like a can is a cylinder. So let me move that over. So that is a cylinder and we're all done. And so these are just useful names to know for shapes. Cylinder is, you're connecting, you have these two faces that are circular and then they're opposite each other. It's kind of like a triangular prism. But instead of having these hard edges, 'cause you have a triangle, you have a base that is a circle and a top that is a circle.."
Math,"Those are its length, height, and width or depth, whatever you want to call it. So given that, what is the volume of this entire rectangular prism going to be? So I'm assuming you've given a go at it. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. You could first think about the volume of each unit cube, and then think about how many unit cubes there are. So let's do that. The unit cube, its volume is going to be 1/4 of a foot times 1/4 of a foot times 1/4 of a foot."
Math,"Or another way to think about it is it's going to be 1/4 times 1/4 times 1/4 cubic feet, which is often written as feet to the third power cubic feet. So 1/4 times 1/4 is 1/16 times 1/4 is 1/64. So this is going to be 1/64 cubic feet, or 1/64 of a cubic foot. That's the volume of each of these. That's the volume of each of these unit cubes. Now, how many of them are there? Well, you could view them as kind of these two layers. The first layer has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
Math,"That's this first layer right over here. That's this first layer right over here. And then we have the second layer down here, which would be another eight. So it's going to be 8 plus 8 or 16. So the total volume here, the total volume is going to be 16 times 1/64 of a cubic foot, which is going to be equal to 16/64. 16/64 cubic feet, cubic feet, which is the same thing, 16/64 is the same thing as 1/4, divide the numerator and the denominator by 16."
Math,"This is the same thing as 1/4 of a cubic foot, of a cubic foot, and that's our volume. Now, there's other ways that you could have done this. You could have just thought about the dimensions of the length, the width, and the height. The width right over here is going to be two times 1/4 feet, which is equal to one half of a foot. The height here is the same thing, it's two times, so it's gonna be two times 1/4 of a foot, which is equal to 2/4 or 1/2 of a foot."
Math,"And then the length, the length here is 4 times 1/4 of a foot. 4 times 1/4 of a foot, well, that's equal to 4/4 of a foot, which is equal to one foot. So to figure out the volume, we could multiply. We could multiply the length times the width, the length times the width times the height. Times the height, and I mean these little dots here, these aren't decimals, I've written them a little higher. These are another way, it's a shorthand for multiplication."
Math,"Instead of writing a, this kind of X looking thing, this cross looking thing. so the length is one, the width is half of a foot, so times one half. And then the height is another half. Let me do it this way. The height is another half. So what's 1 times 1/2 times 1/2? Well, that's going to be equal to 1/4. And this is a foot, this is a foot, this is a foot. So foot, times foot, times foot, that's gonna be feet to the third power or cubic feet, 1/4 of a cubic foot."
Math,"Either way, we got the same result, which is good.."
Math,"The length here is 1 and 1/6th units, and the height here is 3/7ths of a unit. So I encourage you to pause this video and try to figure out the volume of this figure on your own before we work through it together. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. One way to think about it is you're trying to pack unit cubes in here. And one way to think about how many unit cubes could fit in here is to think about the area, is to think about the area of this base right over here."
Math,"So sometimes you'll see volume is equal to the area of the base times the height, times the height. This right over here is the height. And let me make it clear, this is the area of the base. Area of the base times the height. Well, what's the area of the base? Well, the area of the base is the same thing as the length times the width. So you might see it written like that. You might see it written as area of base is going to be your length times your width, times your width."
Math,"Width, length times width is the same thing as your area of the base. So that's that right over there. And, of course, you still have to multiply times the height. Or another way of thinking about it, you're gonna multiply your length times your width times your height. You're gonna multiply the three dimensions of this thing to figure out how many unit cubes could fit into it to figure out the volume. So let's calculate it."
Math,"The volume here is going to be, what's our length? Our length is 1 and 1/6th units. Now, when I multiply fractions as I'm about to do, I don't like to multiply mixed numbers. I like to write them as improper fractions. So let me convert 1 and 1/6th to an improper fraction. So 1 is the same thing as 6/6ths plus 1 is 7/6ths. So this is going to be 7/6. That's my length times 3/5ths, that's my width. So times 3/5ths, times the height, which is 3/7ths times the height, which is 3/7ths."
Math,"And we know when we multiply fractions, we can multiply the numerators. So it's gonna be 7 times 3 times 3 times 3. And the denominator, we can just multiply the denominators. So it's going to be 6 times 5, 6 times 5 times 7 times 7. Now, we could just multiply these out, but just to try to get an answer that is as simplified as I can make it. Let me, see, we have a 7 in the numerator and a 7 in the denominator. So let's divide the numerator and the denominator by 7."
Math,"So let's divide the numerator and the denominator by 7. And what that does is that becomes 1 and those become 1. And we also see both the numerator denominator has 3. They're both divisible by 3. We see a 3 up here. We see a 3 over here. So let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3. So we divide by 3, divide by 3. 3 divided by 3 is 1. 6 divided by 3 is going to be equal to 2."
Math,"So in our numerator, what are we left with? This is going to be equal to, where we're just left with that green 3, it's going to be equal to 3/2 times 5. 2 times 5 is 10, 2 times 5, right over here. So the volume over here is 3/10ths units cubed. Or we could fit 3/10ths of a unit cube inside of this brick or this fish tank or whatever you want to call it.."
Math,"And what we're gonna do in this video is think about how does the volume of this rectangular prism change as we change the height? So let's make a little table here. So let me make my table. So this is going to be our height and this is going to be our volume, V for volume. And so let's say that the height is 5. What is the volume going to be? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out."
Math,"Well, the volume is just going to be the base times height, times depth, or you could say it's gonna be the area of the square. So it's the width times the depth, which is 6 times the height. So that would be 2 times 3 times 5, so 2 times 3 times 5, which is equal to 6 times 5, which is equal to 30, 30 cubic units. We're assuming that these are given in some units, so this would be the units cubed."
Math,"All right, now let's think about it if we were to double the height, what is going to happen to our volume? So if we double the height, our height is 10, what is the volume? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Well, in this situation we're still gonna have 2 times 3, 2 times 3 times our new height, times 10. So now, it's going to be 6 times 10, which is equal to 60. Notice when we doubled the height, if we just double one dimension, we are going to double the volume."
Math,"Let's see if that holds up. Let's double it again. So what happens when our height is 20 units? Well, here our volume is still gonna be 2 times 3 times 20, 2 times 3 times 20, which is equal to 6 times 20, which is equal to 120. So once again, if you double one of the dimensions, in this case, the height, it doubles the volume. And you could think of it the other way. If you were to halve, if you were to go from 20 to 10. So if you halve one of the dimensions, it halves the volume, you go from 120 to 60."
Math,"Now, let's think about something interesting. Let's think about what happens if we double two of the dimensions. So let's say, so we know, I'll just draw these really fast. We know that if we have a situation where we have 2 by 3 and this height is 5, we know the volume here is 30, 30 cubic units. But now let's double two of the dimensions. Let's make this into a 10 and let's make this into a 4. So it's gonna look like this, and then this is gonna be a 4."
Math,"This is still going to be a 3, and our height is going to be a 10. So it's gonna look something like this. So our height is going to be a 10. I haven't drawn it perfectly to scale, but hopefully, you get the idea. So this is our height at 10. What is the volume gonna be now? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Well, 4 times 3 is 12 times 10 is 120. So notice when we doubled two of the dimensions, we actually quadrupled. We actually quadrupled our total volume."
Math,"Think about, pause this video and think about why did that happen? Well, if you double one dimension, you double the volume, but here we're doubling one dimension and then another dimension. So you are multiplying by 2 twice. So think about what would happen if we doubled all of the dimensions. How much would that increase the volume? Pause the video and see if you can do that on your own."
Math,"In general, if you double all the dimensions, what does that do to the volume? Or if you halve all of the dimensions, what does that do to the volume?."
Math,"So let's try to imagine that. So it's a right rectangular prism. This is a fish tank. Let me actually do it in blue. So it, one of the dimensions, that's not blue, that's orange. One of the dimensions is 15.6 centimeters. 15.6 centimeters. And then the other dimension of the base is 7.2 centimeters. 7.2 centimeters. So this is the base right over here. So let me draw this, try to put some perspective in there. And, of course, it is a right rectangular prism, this fish tank that Mario has."
Math,"So it looks something like this. So this is his fish tank. Try to draw it as neatly as I can. So that's the top of the fish tank, just like that. I think this does a decent, respectable job of what this fish tank might look like. And let me erase this thing right over here. And there we go. There is Mario's fish tank. There is his fish tank, and we can even make it look like glass. There you go, that looks nice. All right, the bottom of the tank is filled with marbles."
Math,"And the tank is then filled with water to a height of 6.4 centimeters. So the water is filled to a height of 6.4 centimeters. So this is the water when it's all filled up, 6.4 centimeters. So let's draw that. And I'll make the water, well, maybe I should have made it a little more blue than this, but this gives you the picture. So the height of the water right over here, actually, let me do that in a blue color. The height of the water right over here is 6.4, 6.4 centimeters."
Math,"So that means that the distance from the bottom of the tank to the top of, not the tank, but to the top of the water, is 6.4 centimeters. 6.4 centimeters. Fair enough. So that's the top of the water. When the marbles were removed, and it started off with some marbles on the bottom. They don't tell us how many marbles. When the marbles are removed, the water level drops to a height of 5.9 centimeters. So when they're removed, the water level drops by a little bit, to 5.9 centimeters. 5.9 centimeters."
Math,"So it drops. It drops to 5., it drops to 5.9, from 6.4 to 5.9 centimeters. What is the volume of the water displaced by the marbles? So when you took the marbles out, the water dropped from 6.4. So it dropped from 6.4 centimeters down to 5.9 centimeters. 5.9 centimeters. So how much did it drop? Well, it dropped .5 centimeters, So it dropped, it dropped 0.5 centimeters."
Math,"So what does that tell us about the volume of water displaced by the marbles? Well, the volume of water displaced by the marbles must be the amount of the, must be equivalent to this volume. This volume of this, I guess this, I guess this is another rectangular prism that is the same, where the top area is the same as the base of this water tank. And then the height is the height of the water drop. When you put the marbles in, it takes up more volume, it pushes the water up by that amount, by that volume."
Math,"When you take it out, then that volume gets replaced with the water down here, and then that volume goes back down, the water level goes down to 5.9 centimeters. So we're essentially trying to find the volume of a rectangular prism that is, that is equal to, so it's gonna be 15.6 by 7.2 by .5. And I haven't drawn it to scale yet, but I wanna see all of the measurements."
Math,"So it's going to be 15.6 centimeters in this direction, it's going to be 7.2 centimeters in this direction, and it's going to be .5 centimeters high, 0.5 centimeters high. So we know how to find volume, we just multiply the length times the width times the height. So the volume in centimeter cubed, and we're (indistinct) scale, we're multiplying centimeters, times centimeters, times centimeters, so it's gonna be centimeters cubed, is going to be, so lemme write this down."
Math,"The volume is going to be 15.6 times 7.2 times 0.5, and it's gonna be in centimeters cubed, or cubic centimeters, I guess we could call them. Well, let's first multiply 7.2 times 0.5. We can do that in our head. This part right over here is going to be 3.6, essentially just half of 7.2. So then this becomes 15.6 times 3.6. So let me just multiply that over here. So 15.6 times 3.6. So I'll ignore the decimals for a second. 6 times 6 is 36, 5 times 6 is 30, plus 3, is 33. 1 times 6 is 6, plus 3, is 9."
Math,"And then let's place a zero here. We're down in the 1s place, but I'm ignoring the decimals for now. 3 times 6 is 18, 3 times 5 is 15, plus one is 16, 3 times 1 is 3, plus 1 is four. And then we get 6, 3 plus 8 is 11, 16, 5. Now, if this was 156 times 36, this would be 5,616, but it's not. We have two numbers to the right of the decimal point, one, two, so it's going to be 56.16. So the volume, the volume, and we deserve a drum roll now, is 56.16 cubic, cubic centimeters.."
Math,"A cube is a polyhedron. All the surfaces are flat. All the surfaces are flat. And all of the edges, all of the edges are straight. So this right over here is a polyhedron. Once again, polyhedra is plural. Polyhedron is when you have one of them. This is a polyhedron. A rectangular pyramid is a polyhedron. So let me draw that. I'll make this one a little bit more transparent. And lemme do this in a different color just for fun. I'll make it a magenta, rectangular pyramid."
Math,"So once again, here I have one flat surface. And then I'm gonna have four, four triangular flat surfaces. So this right over here, this is a rectangular pyramid. Now, it clearly looks like a pyramid. Why is it called a rectangular pyramid? Because the base right over here is a rectangle. So these are just a few examples of polyhedra. Now, what I wanna think about are nets of polyhedron. Actually, let me draw and make this transparent too. So we get full appreciation of the entire polyhedron."
Math,"Polyhedron, this entire cube. So now let's think about nets of polyhedron, nets. So what is a net of a polyhedron? Well, one way to think about it is if you kind of viewed this as made up of cardboard and you were to unfold it in some way so it would become flat."
Math,"Or another way of thinking about it is if you were to cut out some cardboard or some paper and you wanted to fold it up into one of these figures, how would you go about doing it? And each of these polyhedra has multiple different nets that you could create. So that can be folded up into this three dimensional figure. So let's take an example. And maybe the simplest example would be a cube like this. And I'm gonna color code it."
Math,"So let's say that the bottom of this cube, the bottom of this cube was this green color. And so I can represent it like this. That's the bottom of the cube. It's that green color. Now let's say that this back surface of the cube is orange. Well, I could represent it like this. And notice I've kind of folded it out. I'm folding it out. And so if I were to flatten it out, it would look like this. Would look like that. Now, this other backside, I'll shade it in yellow."
Math,"This other backside right over here, I could fold it backwards and keep it connected along this edge. Keep it connected along this edge, fold it backwards, it would look like this. It would look like that. I think you get the general idea here. And just to be clear, this edge right over here is this edge right over there. Now I have to worry about this top part. The top part of the cube. Maybe it is in, lemme do it in a pink color."
Math,"This top part of the cube is in this pink color, and it needs to be attached to one of these sides. I could attach it to this side or this side. Let's attach it over here. So let's say it's attached to that yellow side back here. So then when we fold it out, when we really unpack the thing, so we folded that yellow part back, then we're folding this part back, then it would be right over here. It would be right over there."
Math,"And then we could fold, we could fold this front face, this front face right over here, we could fold that out and this along this edge and it would go right over there. It would go right over there. And then we have one face of the cube left. We have this side right over here. And we could, well, we could do actually several things. We could fold it out along this edge and then we would draw, we would draw the surface right over there. Or if we wanna do something interesting, we could fold it out."
Math,"We could fold this out along the edge that it shares with the yellow, that backside. So we could fold it out like this. So if we folded it out like this, it would be connected to the yellow square right over here. So you see that there's many, many ways. There's many, many ways to construct a net or a net that when you fold it all back up will turn into this polyhedron, in this case, a cube. Let's do one more example."
Math,"Let's do the rectangular pyramid 'cause all of these had rectangles, or in particular these had squares as our surfaces. Now, the most obvious one might be to start with your base right over here. Start with your base. And then take the different sides and then just fold them straight out. So for example, we could take this side right over here, fold it out, and it would look like, it would look like that. We could take this side back here. And once again, just fold it out."
Math,"Fold it out, it'll look like that. It should be the same size as that orange side, but I'm hand drawing it so it's not gonna be perfect. So that's that right over there. And then you could take this front side right over here and once again, fold it out along this edge so it would look like this. And then finally, you could take this side right over here and once again, fold it out along this edge and it would go right there. But this isn't the only net for this rectangular pyramid."
Math,"There's other options, for example. And just to explore one of them, instead of folding that green side out that way, instead, instead, we might have wanted to fold it out along this edge, along this edge with the yellow side that you can't see. Actually, let's make it a little bit different. Let's fold it out along this side since we can see the edge. And let me label, let me color the edge. So this is the edge right over here on the blue triangle. So this is the edge."
Math,"And when you fold the green triangle out, it would look like this. If you fold the green triangle out, it would look like this. So hopefully this gives you an appreciation. This gives you appreciation. There's multiple ways to unfold these three dimensional figures, these polyhedra, or multiple ways to, if you wanted to do a cardboard cutout and then fold things back together to construct them. And these flattened versions of them, these things, these unpacking of these polyhedra, we call nets.."
Math,"So let's think about it. So, what's, first of all, the surface area? What's the surface area of this right over here? Well, in the net that corresponds to this area. It's a triangle. It has a base of 12 and a height of eight. So this area right over here is going to be 1/2 times the base, so times 12, times the height, times eight. So this is the same thing as six times eight, which is equal to 48 whatever units, square units. This is gonna be units of area. So that's gonna be 48 square units."
Math,"And up here is the exact same thing. That's the exact same thing. You can't see it in this figure. If it was transparent, if it was transparent, it would be this back side right over here. But that's also going to be 48, 48 square units. Now we can think about the areas of, I guess you could consider them to be the side panels. So that's a side panel right over there. It's 14 high and 10 wide. This is the other side panel."
Math,"It's also, this length right over here is the same as this length, so it's also 14 high and 10 wide. So this side panel is this one right over here. And then you have one on the other side. And so the area of each of these, 14 times 10, they are 140 square units. This one is also 140 square units. And then finally we just have to figure out the area of, I guess you could say the base of this figure. So this whole region right over here, which is this area, which is that area right over there."
Math,"And that's going to be 12 by 14. So this area is 12 times 14, which is equal to, let's see, 12 times 12 is 144, plus another 24, so it's 168. So the total area is going to be, let's see, if you add this one and that one, you get 96, 96 square units. The two magenta, I guess you could say, side panels, 140 plus 140, that's 280. And then you have this base that comes in at 168. Want me do that same color? 168, 168."
Math,"Add them all together and we get the surface area for the entire figure, and it was super valuable to open it up into the net 'cause we could make sure we got all of the sides. We didn't have to kind of rotate it in our brains, although you could do that as well. So six plus zero plus eight is 14. Regroup the one 10 to the tens place. So it's now one 10. So one plus nine is 10, plus eight is 18, plus six is 24. And then you have, oops. And then you have two plus two plus one is five."
Math,"So the surface area of this figure is 544, 544 square units.."
Math,"And then add them all together. So let's do that. So the front of the box is 20 centimeters tall and 10 centimeters wide. It's a rectangle. So to figure out its area, we can just multiply 20 centimeters times 10 centimeters, and that's going to give us 200 centimeters, 200 centimeters or 200 square centimeters, I should say, 200 square centimeters. That's the area of the front. And lemme write it over here as well, 200."
Math,"Now we also know there's another side that has the exact same area as the front of the box, and that's the back of the box. And so let's write another 200 square centimeters for the back of the box. Now let's figure out the area of the top of the box. The top of the box is, we see it's three. The box is three centimeters deep. So this right over here is three centimeters. Three, it's three centimeters deep and it's 10 centimeters wide. We see that the box is 10 centimeters wide."
Math,"So the top of the box is gonna be three centimeters times 10 centimeters, which is 30 square centimeters of area. So that's the top of the box. 30 square centimeters. Well, the bottom of the box is gonna have the exact same area. We just can't see it right now. So that's gonna be another 30. And then we have two more sides 'cause this box has six sides. We have this side panel that is 20 centimeters tall. We see that the height of the box is 20 centimeters and three centimeters deep."
Math,"So three times, three times 20, 3 times. Let me write that a little bit neater. Three times 20, that's 20 centimeters right there. Three centimeters times 20 centimeters is gonna give us 60 square centimeters, 60 square centimeters. Now that's this side panel, but there's another side panel that has the exact same air that's on the other side of the box. So it's 60 centimeters squared or squared centimeters for this side. And then another 60 for the corresponding side opposite to it that we can't see."
Math,"And now we can just add up all of these together. And so we get zero. Let's see, this is going to be, let's see, carry the one or regroup the one. It's a 100 and then we have 500. So we get 580 square centimeters is the surface area of this box.."
Math,"So what am I talking about? Well, what we have here, we could imagine making a cut in the box and the cut could be, see, I could make a cut back here so I could make a cut right over there. I could cut it. I could cut it right like this. I could cut it like that. So if I just did that, this top flap would flap open. So that would be able to come out like that. And then I could also make a cut for this side so I can make a cut back there. And I could make a cut right over here."
Math,"And now this side could flap forward, and I could do the same thing on this other side right over here. Then that could flap forward. And then the backside, I could draw it. So I would also have a cut, I'll draw it as a dotted line. 'Cause you're not be able to, you're not supposed to be able to see this cut, but the corresponding cut to this one on this side that we can't see. Lemme draw it a little bit neater than that. The corresponding cut would be right back here, right back there."
Math,"And then a cut right over here. And so what would happen if we were to flatten all of this out? Well, we would have the front of the box. I'll try to draw this as neatly as I can. So the front of the box looks like this. We would have this top flap, which looks like this. If we were to flatten it all out, we have these two side flaps. So that's a side flap. That's a side flap. And this is another, this side flap right over here. That's a side flap. Then we would have the bottom of the box."
Math,"So the bottom of the box is gonna look like this, bottom of the box. And then we have the back of the box that the bottom is going to be connected to, we didn't cut that. So that we have the back of the box. The back of the box looks like this. And there we have it. We've made the net. This is what would happen if you made the cuts that I talked about and then flatten the box out. It would look like this."
Math,"Now how could we use this net to find the surface area? Well, we just need to figure out the surface area of this shape now. So how do we do that? Well, we know a lot about the dimensions. We know that this width right over here, that this is 10 centimeters. 10 centimeters from there to there. We know the height actually going all the way from here all the way up, because the height of the box is 20 centimeters."
Math,"So this is going to be 20 centimeters, right over here, then you have another 20 centimeters, you have another 20 centimeters right over here and right over here if you like. And then you have, see the depth of the box is three centimeters. So this is three centimeters. Three centimeters. And then this is three centimeters. And so what is the area, actually, let me just do one region first."
Math,"What is the area of this entire region that I am, that I am shading in with this blue color? Well, it's 10 centimeters. That is, I'll do a color that you can see a little bit more easily. It is 10 centimeters wide. 10 centimeters, times, what's the height? 20 plus three plus 20 plus three. So that's going to be 40 plus six. So times 46 centimeters. That's this blue area. So that's gonna be 460 square centimeters, 460 square centimeters. And now we just have to figure out the area of the two flaps."
Math,"So this flap right over here is 20 centimeters by three centimeters, so that's 60 centimeters squared. So 60 centimeters squared, or 60 square centimeters I should say. And then this flap is gonna have the exact same area, another 60 square centimeters, 60 square centimeters. And you add everything together. We deserve a little bit of a drum roll. We get, well this is gonna add up to 580 square centimeters, which is the exact thing we got in the other video where we didn't use a net."
Math,"And you should just, it's nice to be able to do it either way to be able to visualize the net or be able to look at this and think about the different sides, even the sides that you might not necessarily see.."
Math,"How much gold foil did it take to cover the trophy, including the bottom? And so they give us some dimensions and we want how much gold foil, and it's an inches squared, so it's really going to be an area. So pause this video and see if you can figure that out. How much gold foil did it take to cover the trophy? All right, now let's work through this together."
Math,"And so essentially, what they're asking is what is the surface area of this square pyramid? And we're gonna include the base, 'cause that surface area is how much, it's the area of the gold foil that is needed. Now, sometimes, some of you might be able to think about this just by looking at this figure, but just to make sure we don't miss any area, I'm gonna open up this square pyramid and think about it in two dimensions."
Math,"So what we're gonna do is imagine if I were to unleash, or if I were to cut the top and, let me do this in red, if I were to cut this edge, if I were to cut this edge, if I were to cut that edge, and that edge, so the edges that connect the triangular sides, and if I were to just open it all up, what would this look like? So if I were to open it all up. Well at the bottom, you would have your square base. Let me color that in. So you have your square base. So let me draw that. So you have your square base."
Math,"This is gonna be a rough drawing. And what are the dimensions there? It's three by three. We know this is a square pyramid, so the base, all the sides are the same length. They give us one side, but then if this is three inches, and this is gonna be three inches as well. And let me color that same color, just so we recognize that we're talking about this same base. And if we open up the triangular faces, what's it going to look like? Well, this is going to look like this."
Math,"This is a rough hand drawing, but hopefully it makes sense. This is going to look like this. And each of these triangular faces, they all have the exact same area, and the reason why I know that, they all have the same base, three, and they all have the same height, six inches, but I'll draw that in a second. So they all look something like this, just hand drawing it. And all of their heights, all of their heights are six inches. So this right over here is six inches. This over here is six inches."
Math,"This over here is six inches. And this over here is six inches. So to figure out how much gold foil we need, we're trying to figure out the surface area, which is really just gonna be the combined area of these figures. Well, the area of this central square is pretty easy to figure out. It's three inches by three inches, so it would be nine inches, nine inches squared."
Math,"Now, what are the area of the triangles? Well, we could figure out the area of one of the triangles and then multiply by four since there are four triangles. So the area of this triangle right over here, it's gonna be one half times our base, which is three times three times our height, which is six. Let's see, one half times three times six. That's one half times 18, which is equal to nine, nine square inches or nine inches squared."
Math,"So what's gonna be our total area? Well, you have the area of your square base plus you have the four sides, which each have an area of nine, so I could write it out. I could write four times nine, or I could write nine. Do that black color, or I could write nine plus nine plus nine plus nine. And just to remind ourselves, this is, that right over there, is the area of one triangular face. Triangular face. So this is all of the triangular faces."
Math,"Triangular faces, and of course ,we have to add that to the area of their square base. So this is nine plus nine times four. You could view this as nine times five, which is gonna be 45 square inches, nine plus nine plus nine plus nine.."
Math,"It's involving collecting data, collecting data. You could present data in tables or charts, or just as lists of numbers, or however you might do it. It is analyzing the data, analyzing, analyzing, presenting and analyzing data. So this whole class of just all this stuff that you might do with data to answer a question or try to figure out what's going on, or just to learn about the world, the whole class of things is called statistics."
Math,"Now an idea that will come up very frequently in statistics is the notion of variability. Variability. In everyday language, variability, it's how much something is ... How much does it vary? How much does it change? It's the same notion in statistics. In statistics, variability is the degree to which data points are different from each other, the degree to which they vary."
Math,"Just as an example of that to just make it a little bit more concrete, let's say you were to go to five people, and you were to ask them, how many bricks did you eat yesterday? Each of the people say, well I ... Person one says, ""I don't eat bricks at all. ""I don't even know how to do that. ""I ate zero bricks."" Then next person says zero, the next person says zero, fourth person says zero, and the fifth person says zero. Fair enough, so that was our data point on the different data points on ..."
Math,"And I'm already doing statistics just by going out there and asking them how many bricks they ate. Then I ask them how many grapes did you eat yesterday? The first person says ""I ate zero grapes."" But the next person says ""I survive on grapes. ""I ate 235 grapes."" The next person says, ""Yeah I like grapes. ""I ate 17 grapes."" Then the person after that says that they five grapes. Then next person also survives on grapes, even to a larger degree. They ate 318 grapes."
Math,"So if you look at these two data sets, one is the number of bricks someone ate yesterday, the other one is how many grapes they ate yesterday, you immediately see that there's more variability here. All of these data points are zero, while these, they change a good bit from data point to data point. So we have a sense that there is more variability in this data set. Now one of the things we will start doing a lot in statistics is try to measure how much more, how much variability is."
Math,"How can we can quantify that? How can we put a number on it? How can we measure variability? This is a big aspect of statistics, but we won't do that in this video. There are future videos for doing that."
Math,"But just as we go into the world of statistics, we should think about when should our brain even start getting into statistics mode, thinking about the tools that we have at our disposal, about collecting data and measuring variability, and measuring and finding numbers that somehow represent a pool of data that has variability. So the question we should ask ourselves is what questions in the world are statistical questions? So statistical, statistical questions."
Math,"So let's come up with a definition for statistical questions, the type of question where we would want to start bringing out our statistical toolkit. One possible way to think about when you need to bring out your statistical toolkit is these are questions that to answer them, to answer, you need to collect data with variability. To answer, you need to collect data with variability. I apologize for my handwriting. Data with variability. That's W-I-T-H. Data with variability."
Math,"So you're saying, okay that kinda makes sense, but I need to see some tangible questions or tangible examples of things that are statistical questions and things that are not statistical questions. I would say fair enough. Let's look at some examples. So here I have six questions, and I encourage you to pause this video right now. Before I work through it, think about it."
Math,"Based on this definition of a statistical question, which of these questions are statistical, would require your statistical toolkit, and which of these are not statistical? So assuming you had a go at it, let's go through these one by one. So the first question, how much does my pet grapefruit weigh? You know, it's bizarre to begin with to have a pet grapefruit, but is this a statistical question? What do I need to do to answer it? I have to take my pet grapefruit out. I have to weigh it."
Math,"Then I have to just write that down. Just doing that I am collecting data, so you could argue that maybe I'm kinda starting to mess with statistics a little bit, but I'm just getting one data point. So I might weigh it and I might see my grapefruit weighs one pound, but that's not data with variability. That's just one data point. In order to have variability you have to have multiple data points and should be at least possible that they could vary."
Math,"So, for example, all of these folks ate zero bricks but maybe it was possible that someone actually ate a brick. But here I have just one data point. With one data point, you can't have variability, so this is not a statistical question. I just collect a data point."
Math,"Next question, what is the average number of cars in a parking lot on Monday mornings? To think about whether it is a statistical question, we just have to think about what do I have to do to answer that question? I would have to go out to the parking lot on multiple Monday mornings, and measure the number of cars. So on the first Monday morning I might see there are 50 cars. The next Monday morning I might go out there and count there's 49 cars. The next Monday morning I might see 50 cars again."
Math,"The next Monday morning I might see 63 cars. So I'm collecting multiple data points to answer this question. Then I'm going to take the average of all these, but I'm collecting multiple data points to answer this question. It's definitely possible that there could be variation here, that there could be variability, so this is a statistical question. Next question, am I hungry? It's an important question. We ask it to ourselves multiple times. In fact, sometimes our bodies just tell it to us."
Math,"But I am definitely not collecting ... I guess you could say I'm collecting some type of feelings from my stomach or how weak I feel or not, but it's definitely not data with variability. I'm either hungry or not hungry on a given day. I mean if you said broader, how does my hunger change from day to day and you came up some type of a scale for rating your hunger, all right maybe that's more statistical. But just am I hungry, a yes-no question. This is not ..."
Math,"To answer this I do not have to collect data with variability, so this is not a statistical question. How many teeth does my mother have? To do this I would have to go find my mother, and then I would have to ask her to open her mouth, and count the teeth in her mouth. Maybe I'd get a number like 30. So it's kind of like how much does my pet grapefruit weigh."
Math,"I do have to collect one data point, but one data point is not going to have variability, so I am not collecting data with variability, so this is not a statistical question. If I said how many teeth do all of the mothers that I know have on average, or what's the range of number of teeth of the mothers I know have, that would be statistical. But this is just one data point, so not statistical."
Math,"How much time do the members of my family spend eating per year? Once again, what do I need to do to answer this question? I would have to go either observe or survey my family members, maybe my mom, my wife, my children, and my uncles, aunts, whoever else, and I would say how much do you eat each day? I would add them all up to figure out how much they eat in a year. Maybe family member A eats 813 hours in a year. Family member B ate, I don't know, 732 hours in the year."
Math,"So you see the general notion that I will be collecting multiple data points from the different family members. There very well, and in fact, there's very likely to be variation in that. In fact, I might even see variation from year to year. Person A is probably going to eat a different number of hours in the next year. So I'm definitely going to collect data with variability in order to answer this question. So that is a statistical question."
Math,"Then finally, I have the question, how many times have I watched Star Wars? This is very similar to how many teeth does my mother have, or how much does my pet grapefruit weigh. I just have to count the number of times that I watched Star Wars. Maybe I watched it seven times. Just one data point. No variability here. If I said on average how many times have my co-workers watched Star Wars, then I'm gonna have to collect data with variability."
Math,"I'm gonna collect multiple data points, and it's definitely possible that my co-workers have watched it different numbers of times. But for this question in particular, where it's just one data point to answer it, how many times have I watched Star Wars? My answer in this case actually I think is seven. Then not a statistical question. So hopefully that gives you a sense of statistics variability and what a statistical question even is.."
Math,"Remember, data is just recorded information, and it could be numeric like this, it could be quantitative, so you're recording actual numbers, or it could even be things you could record data on how do they like the test, and they could have scored it based on, I really liked it, I kind of liked it, I didn't like it, or they might have rated it on a scale of zero to five, which would have been numbers, but it's numbers that are measuring peoples' opinions, as opposed to, here, we have numbers that are measuring their actual scores."
Math,"So there's all different types of data, and I don't want to get into all of that, but let's just start thinking about different ways to represent this data. So this is one way, you could view this as a table where you have the name, and then you have the score. So you have your name column, and then you have your score column. And I can construct it as a table, so clearly, it looks like a table. Like that, that's one way, one very common way of representing data, just like that."
Math,"That's actually how most traditional databases record data, in tables like this. But you could also do it in other ways. So you could record it as a... Often times called a bar graph, or sometimes, a histogram, so you could put score on the vertical axis here, and then you could have your names over here. And let's see the scores, let's see, maybe we'll make this a 50. Actually, let me just mark them off. So this is 10, 20, 30, that's too big. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, so that's..."
Math,"And then 100, so that's 100. One, two, three, four, five, that would be 50 right over there, and then you can go person by person. So Amy got a 90 on the exam, so the bar will go up to 90. So that is Amy, and then you have Bill, got a 95, so it's going to be between 90 and 100, so it's going to be right over there. Bill got a 95, and so it'll look like this. Bill, so that is Bill. And then you have Cam, who got 100, on the exam."
Math,"So, make sure, you see I'm hand drawing it, so it's not as precise as if I were to do it on a computer. So this right over there, that is Cam's score. Efra got the same score as Cam, so her score is going to be, let me do that in Efra's color, and that's Efra's score right there. She also got 100. So, Efra... Efra, and then finally, Farah got an 80, so 60, 70, 80, so Farah got an 80. So this is Farah's score right over here."
Math,"So this is another way of representing the data, and here we see it in visual form, but it has the same information. You can look up someone's name, and then figure out their score. Amy scored a 90, Bill scored a 95, Cam scored 100, Efra also scored 100, Farah scored an 80. And there's even other ways you can have some of this information. In fact sometimes, you might not even know their names, and so then it would be less information but (mumbles) a list of scores."
Math,"The professor might say, ""Hey, here are the five scores ""that people got on the exam."" And they were listed 90, 95, 100... 100, and 80, now, if it was listed, this was all the data you got, this is less information than the data that's in this bar graph, or this histogram, or the data that's given in this table right over here, because here, not only do we know the scores, but we know who got what score."
Math,"Here, we only know the list of scores, but there's even other ways, and this is not an exhaustive video of all of the different ways you can represent data. You can also represent data by looking at the frequency of scores. So, the frequency of scores right over here, so instead of writing the people, you could write the scores. So let's see, you could say this is 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100, and then you could record the frequency that people got these scores."
Math,"So how many times do we have a score of an 80? Well, Farah is the only person with a score of 80, so you put one data point there. No one got an 85, one person got a 90, so you put a data point there. One person got a 95, so you can put that data point right over there. And then two people got 100. So this is one and two. Let's see the other 100 is in this color, so I'll just do it in the color. You wouldn't necessarily have to color code it like this."
Math,"So this is another way to represent, and this axis, you could just view it as the number. So this tells you how many 80s there were, how many 90s there are, how many 95s, and how many 100s. So this right over here, has the same data as this list of numbers. It's just another way of looking at it. And once you have your data arranged in any of these ways, we can start to ask interesting questions."
Math,"We can ask ourselves things like, well, what is the range of data? What is the range in the data? And the range is just the spread between the lowest point and the highest point. So the range in this data, is going to be the difference between the highest score, and the highest scores are 100, and the lowest score, an 80, so the range is going to be the difference between the max, minus the min. The maximum score minus the minimum score."
Math,"So it's going to be 100 minus 80 is equal to 20, so that gives you a sense of things, it kind of gives you a sense of spread. You could also ask yourself, well, how many people scored below 100? And these are just interesting questions. Below 100, and you can actually answer that question, well, actually, you could have answered either of these questions with any of these different ways of looking at the data."
Math,"If you say, how many people scored below 100? Well, one, two, three? How many people scored below 100? Well, 100 is up here, so it's giong to be one, two, three. How many people scored below 100? One, two, three. How many people scored below 100? One, two, three. And so, any way you look at it, you would have gotten three. And you could also ask yourself, what is the most frequent score? So, most frequent. And once again, you could answer that question with any of these ways of representing this data."
Math,"You could look at our original table and you say, look, there's only one 90, one 95, one 80, there's two 100s. So you'd say look, the most frequent score is 100. You'd see that over here too, you actually have two 100s, there's only one of each of the other scores. Here you also see the 200s, and here is probably the clearest if you're looking at frequency. Sometimes this might be called a frequency plot. It's often called a frequency plot."
Math,"And you see here, the most frequent one is the one that has the most dots on it which is 100. So anyway, that's just a very, high level overview of how you can look at data in different ways to represent data, but the one thing I really want you to get from this, is that these are all different ways of representing the same data. And we could probably invent other ways of doing it as well.."
Math,"Frequency table. Frequency table. What we're gonna do is, we're gonna look at each ... for each age, for each possible age that we've measured here, see how many students in the class are of that age. So we could say, the age is one column, and then the number, the number of students of that age ... Or we could even say, the frequency. Frequency. When people say, ""How frequent do you do something?"" They're saying, ""How often does it happen? ""How often do you do that thing?"" Frequency."
Math,"Or we could also say ... Actually, I'll just write ""number."" I'm always a fan of the simpler. Number at age, which we could also consider the frequency at that age. Frequency of students. All right. So what's the lowest age that we have here? Well, the lowest age is five. So I'll start with five. And how many students in the class are age five? How frequent is the number five? Let's see, there is one, two. Let me keep scanning. Looks like there's only two fives. So I could write a two here."
Math,"There are two fives. And now let's go to six. How many sixes are there? Let's see, there is one six. There's only one six-year-old in the class. All right. Seven-year-olds. See, there's one, two, three, four seven-year-olds. Four seven-year-olds. Now, what about eight-year-olds? Eight-year-olds, I'm gonna use a color that I have not used yet. Eight-year-olds, we have no eight-year-olds. Zero eight-year-olds. And then we have nine-year-olds. Let's see."
Math,"Nine-year-olds, we have one, two, three, four nine-year-olds. Four nine-year-olds. 10-year-olds? What do we have? We have one 10-year-old, right over there. And then 11-year-olds. 11-year-olds, there are no 11-year-olds. And then, let me scroll up a little bit. And then finally, 12-year-olds. 12-year-olds, there are one, two 12-year-olds. So what we have just constructed is a frequency table. It's a frequency table."
Math,"You can see, you can see for each age, how many students are at that age? So it's giving you the same information as we have up here. You could take this table and construct what we have up here. You would just write down two fives, one six, four sevens, no eights, four nines, one 10, no 11s, and two 12s, and then you would just have this list of numbers. Now, a way to visually look at a frequency table is a dot plot. So let me draw a dot plot right over here. A dot plot."
Math,"And a dot plot, we essentially just take the same information, and even think about it the same way. But we just show it visually. In a dot plot, what we would have ... In a dot plot, what we would have ... Actually, let me just not draw an even arrow there. We have the different age groups, so five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, and 12, and we have a dot to represent, or we use a dot for each student at that age. So there's two five-year-olds, so I'll do two dots. One, and two."
Math,"There's one six-year-old, so that's gonna be one dot, right over here. There's four seven-year-olds, so one, two, three, four dots. There's no eight-year-olds. There's four nine-year-olds, so one, two, three, and four. There's one 10-year-old. So let's put a dot, one dot, right over there for that one 10-year-old. There's no 11-year-olds. I'm not gonna put any dots there. And then there's two 12-year-olds. So one 12-year-old, and another 12-year-old."
Math,"So there you go, we have a frequency table, dot plot, list of numbers. These are all showing the same data, just in different ways. Once you have it represented in any of these ways, we can start to ask questions about it. So we could say, ""What is the most frequent age?"" Well, the most frequent age, when you look at it visually, or the easiest thing might be just to look at the dot plot because you see visually, the most frequent age are the two highest stacks."
Math,"There's actually seven and nine are tied for the most frequent age. You'd have also seen it here, where seven and nine are tied at four. And if you just had this data, you would actually, you'd have to count all of them to kind of come up with this again and say, ""Okay, there's four sevens, four nines. ""That's the largest number."" So this is, if you're looking for, what's the most frequent age? When you just visually inspect here, probably pops out at you the fastest."
Math,"But there's other questions we can ask ourselves. We can ask ourselves, ""What is the range? ""What is the range of ages in the classroom?"" And this is once again where maybe the dot plot jumps out at you the most, because the range is just the maximum age ... or, the maximum data point minus the minimum data point. So what's the maximum age here? Well, the maximum age here, we see it from the dot plot, is 12. And the minimum age here, you see, is five. So there's a range of seven."
Math,"The difference between the maximum and the minimum is seven. But you could have also done that over here. You could say, ""The maximum age here is 12. ""Minimum age here is five. ""And so let's subtract ..."" You find the difference between 12 and five, which is seven. Here, you'd have done ... You still could have done it. You'd say, ""Okay, what's the lowest? ""Let's see, five. Are there any fours here? ""Nope, there's no fours. ""So five's the minimum age. ""And what's the largest? ""Is it seven? No."
Math,"""Is it nine? Nine, maybe 10. ""Oh, 12. 12. ""Are there any 13s? No. ""12 is the maximum."" So you say, ""12 minus five is seven"" to get the range. But then we could ask ourselves other questions. We could say, ""How many ... ""How many older ... ""older than nine?"" is a question we could ask ourselves. And then, if we were to look at the dot plot, we'd say, ""Okay, this is nine."" And we'd care about how many are older than nine. So that would be this one, two and three. Or you could look over here."
Math,"How many are older than nine? Well, it's the one person who's 10 and then the two who are 12. So there are three. And over here, if you said, ""How many are older than nine?"" Well, then you'd just have to go through the list and say, ""Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ""okay, here, one, two, three."" And then not that person right over there. So hopefully you ... This is just an appreciation for yet another two ways of looking at data, frequency tables and dot plots.."
Math,"And so you're interested in somehow presenting this, somehow visualizing the distribution of the ages, because you want just say, well, are there more young people? Are there more teenagers? Are there more middle-aged people? Are there more seniors here? And so when you just look at these numbers it really doesn't give you a good sense of it. It's just a bunch of numbers."
Math,"And so how could you do that? Well one way to think about it, is to put these ages into different buckets, and then to think about how many people are there in each of those buckets? Or sometimes someone might say how many in each of those bins? So let's do that. So let's do buckets or categories. So, I like, sometimes it's called a bin. So the bucket, I like to think of it more of as a bucket, the bucket and then the number in the bucket. The number in the bucket. Number, I'll just write the number, oops."
Math,"It's the, oops. It's the number (laughing), it's the number in the bucket. Alright. So let's just make buckets. Let's make them 10 year ranges. So let's say the first one is ages zero to nine. So how many people... Why don't we just define all of the buckets here? So the next one is ages 10 to 19, then 20 to 29, then 30 to 39, and 40 to 49, 50 to 59, let me make sure you can read that properly, then you have 60 to 69. And I think that covers everyone. I don't see anyone 70 years old or older here."
Math,"So then how many people fall into the zero to nine-year-old bucket? Well it's gonna be one, two, three, four, five, six people fall into that bucket. How many people fall into the... How many people fall into the 10 to 19-year-old bucket? Well, let's see. One, two, three. Three people. And I think you see where this is going. What about 20 to 29? So that's one, two, three, four, five people. Five people fall into that bucket. Alright, what about 30 to 39? We have one, and that's it."
Math,"Only one person in that 30 to 39 bin or bucket or category. Alright, what about 40 to 49? We have one, two people. Two people are in that bucket. And then 50 to 59. Let's see, you have one, two people. Two people. And then finally, finally, ages 60-69. Let me do that in a different color. 60 to 69. There is one person, right over there. So this is one way of thinking about how the ages are distributed, but let's actually make a visualization of this."
Math,"And the visualization that we're gonna create, this is called a histogram. Histogram. Histogram. We're taking data that can take on a whole bunch of different values, we're putting them into categories, and then we're gonna plot how many folks are in each category. How big are each of those? How big are each of those categories? And actually, I wrote histogram. I wrote histograph, I should have written histogram. So a histogram. So let's do this. Alright."
Math,"So on this axis, let's see, the largest category has six. So this the number, number of folks. And it's gonna go one, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. This is the number. And on this axis I'm gonna make the buckets. The buckets, and let me scroll up a little bit. Now that I have my data here, I don't have to look at my data set again. So I have one bucket. This is going to be the zero to nine bucket, right over here. Zero to nine. Then I'm going to have the three..."
Math,"Actually, let me just plot them, since I have my pen that color. So in zero to nine there are six people. Zero to nine, there are six people. So I'll just plot it like that. And then we have the 10 to 19. There are three people. So 10 to 19, there are three people. So I'll do a bar, like this. Then, 20 to 29, I have five people. 20 to 29, which is gonna be this one, just getting, I'm writing too big. So 20 to 29 is gonna be this bar. There's five people. Five people there. So it'll look like this."
Math,"I should have made the bars wide enough so I could write below them. But I've already, that train has already left. (laughing) Alright, alright. Then 30 to 39, I'll try to write smaller. 30 to 39, that's gonna be this bar right over here. We have one person. One person. And then we have 40 to 49. We have two people. 40 to 49, two people. So, it looks like this. 40 to 49, two people. Almost there. 50 to 59. We have two people. 50 to 59, we also have two people. So that's that right over there."
Math,"That's this category. And then finally, 60 to 69 we have one person. 60 to 69, we have one person. We have one person. And what I have just constructed, I took our data. I took our data. I put it into buckets that are kind of representative of the categories I care about. Zero to nine is kind of young kids. 10 to 19, I guess you could call them adolescents or roughly teenagers, although, obviously if you're 10 you're not quite a teenager yet. And then all the different age groups."
Math,"And then when I counted the number in each bucket and I plotted it, now I can visually get a sense of how are the ages distributed in this restaurant. This must be some type of a restraunt that gives away toys or something, because there's a lot of younger people. Maybe it's very family-friendly. So every adult that comes in, maybe there's a lot of young adults with kids, or maybe grandparents up here, and they just bring a lot of kids to this restaurant. So it gives you a view of what's going on here."
Math,"Just a lot of kids here, a lot fewer senior citizens. So once again, this is just a way of visualizing things. We took a lot of data that can take multiple data points. Instead of plotting each data point, like we might do in a dot plot, instead of saying how many one-year-olds are there? Well there's only one one-year old. How many three-year-olds are there? There's only one three-year old. That wouldn't give us much information. We would just have these single dots if we were doing a dot plot."
Math,"But as a histogram, we're able to put them into buckets. Everybody was like, hey, you know generally between the ages zero and nine we have six people. And so you see that plotted out, just like that. And obviously this doesn't apply just to ages of people in a restaurant, it applies to all sorts of data that you might want to collect and observe.."
Math,"So what you're curious about is what is the distribution, how many of different types of pies do you have? how may pies do you have that have a lot of cherries, how many pies that have a few cherries, how many pies are in between? So, to do that, you set up a histogram. what you do is you take each pie in your store, (See I can draw a pie in some kind) it's a cherry pie, I don't know if this is adequate of drawing of a pie. You take each pie in your store, and you count the number of cherries on it."
Math,"This pie has 1,2,3,4,5 6,7,8,9,10,keep counting Let's say it has 32 cherries. And you are going to do it for every pie. and then you create buckets. Because you don't want to create just a graph I'm not having exactly 32. You just want to get a general sense of things."
Math,"So you create buckets of 30 you say how many pies have between 0 and 29 cherries? how many pies are between 30 and 59, including 30 and 59? how many pies have at least 60 at most 89 cherries? how many pies have at least 90 at most 119? and then how many pies have at least 120 and at most 149? you know that you don't have any pie that have more than 149 cherries so this should account for everything."
Math,"Then you count them so for example, 5 pies have more than 30 to 59 cherries and so we create a histogram when you create a histogram, you make this magenta bar go up to 5 so that's how you would construct this histogram that's what the pies at different cherry levels histogram is telling us. so now we have construct it; Let's see if we can interpret it based on the information given in the histogram."
Math,So the first question is: based on just this information can you figure out the total number of pies in your store? soon be there all accounted for by this histogram and I encourage you to pause this video and try to figure it out on your own What was the total number of pies? Let's see. There's five pies there's five pies that have ... at least 30 cherries but no more than 59. you have eight pies in this blue bucket you have four pies in this green bucket and then you have ...
Math,"three pies that have at least 120 but no more than 149 cherries this accounts for all the pies so the total number of pies you have at the store 5 plus 8 plus 4 plus 3 which is what, 5 plus 8 is 13 plus 4,=17, plus 3 is twenty. So there are 20 pies in this store. Then you can ask more a more nuance question. what if you want to know the number of pies with more than 60 cherries the number of pies with more than 60 number of pies with I'll say this 60 or more 60 or more cherries so let's think about it."
Math,"well this magenta bar doesn't apply because these all have less than 60 but all these other bars are accounting pies that have 60 or more cherries this is 60 to 89, this is 90 to 119 this is a 120 to 149 so it's going to be these eight cherries sorry, these eight pies that are in this bucket plus these four pies, plus these three pies so it is going to be essentially everything but this first bucket everything but all the pies except for these five pies have 60 or more cherries so should be five less than 20 Let's see."
Math,"8+4=12,plus 3 is 15 which is five less than 20. So using this histogram we can answer really interest question, which would say how many more pies do we have that have 60-89 cherries than 120 to 149 cherries? We have eight pies at 60-89 60-89 cherries, three that have a 120-149 We have five more pies in the 60 to 89 category that we do in the 120 to 149 categories A lot of questions that we can start to answer hopefully this gives you a sense of how you can interpret histograms.."
Math,"So if we have a bunch of data, and if we want to tell something about all of that data without giving them all of the data, can we somehow describe it with a smaller set of numbers? So that's what we're going to focus on. And then once we build our toolkit on the descriptive statistics, then we can start to make inferences about that data, start to make conclusions, start to make judgments. And we'll start to do a lot of inferential statistics, make inferences."
Math,"So with that out of the way, let's think about how we can describe data. So let's say we have a set of numbers. We can consider this to be data. Maybe we're measuring the heights of our plants in our garden. And let's say we have six plants. And the heights are 4 inches, 3 inches, 1 inch, 6 inches, and another one's 1 inch, and another one is 7 inches."
Math,"And let's say someone just said-- in another room, not looking at your plants, just said, well, you know, how tall are your plants? And they only want to hear one number. They want to somehow have one number that represents all of these different heights of plants. How would you do that? Well, you'd say, well, how can I find something that-- maybe I want a typical number. Maybe I want some number that somehow represents the middle. Maybe I want the most frequent number."
Math,"Maybe I want the number that somehow represents the center of all of these numbers. And if you said any of those things, you would actually have done the same things that the people who first came up with descriptive statistics They said, well, how can we do it? And we'll start by thinking of the idea of average. And in every day terminology, average has a very particular meaning, as we'll see. When many people talk about average, they're talking about the arithmetic mean, which we'll see shortly."
Math,"But in statistics, average means something more general. It really means give me a typical, or give me a middle number, or-- and these are or's. And really it's an attempt to find a measure of central tendency. So once again, you have a bunch of numbers. You're somehow trying to represent these with one number we'll call the average, that's somehow typical, or middle, or the center somehow of these numbers. And as we'll see, there's many types of averages."
Math,"The first is the one that you're probably most familiar with. It's the one-- and people talk about hey, the average on this exam or the average height. And that's the arithmetic mean. Just let me write it in. I'll write in yellow, arithmetic mean. When arithmetic is a noun, we call it arithmetic. When it's an adjective like this, we call it arithmetic, arithmetic mean."
Math,"And this is really just the sum of all the numbers divided by-- this is a human-constructed definition that we've found useful-- the sum of all these numbers divided by the number of numbers we have. So given that, what is the arithmetic mean of this data set? Well, let's just compute it. It's going to be 4 plus 3 plus 1 plus 6 plus 1 plus 7 over the number of data points we have. So we have six data points. So we're going to divide by 6."
Math,"And we get 4 plus 3 is 7, plus 1 is 8, plus 6 is 14, plus 1 is 15, plus 7. 15 plus 7 is 22. Let me do that one more time. You have 7, 8, 14, 15, 22, all of that over 6. And we could write this as a mixed number. 6 goes into 22 three times with a remainder of 4. So it's 3 and 4/6, which is the same thing as 3 and 2/3. We could write this as a decimal with 3.6 repeating. So this is also 3.6 repeating. We could write it any one of those ways. But this is kind of a representative number."
Math,"This is trying to get at a central tendency. Once again, these are human-constructed. No one ever-- it's not like someone just found some religious document that said, this is the way that the arithmetic mean must be defined. It's not as pure of a computation as, say, finding the circumference of the circle, which there really is-- that was kind of-- we studied the universe. And that just fell out of our study of the universe. It's a human-constructed definition that we found useful."
Math,"Now there are other ways to measure the average or find a typical or middle value. The other very typical way is the median. And I will write median. I'm running out of colors. I will write median in pink. So there is the median. And the median is literally looking for the middle number. So if you were to order all the numbers in your set and find the middle one, then that is your median. So given that, what's the median of this set of numbers going to be? Let's try to figure it out. Let's try to order it."
Math,"So we have 1. Then we have another 1. Then we have a 3. Then we have a 4, a 6, and a 7. So all I did is I reordered this. And so what's the middle number? Well, you look here. Since we have an even number of numbers, we have six numbers, there's not one middle number. You actually have two middle numbers here. You have two middle numbers right over here. You have the 3 and the 4. And in this case, when you have two middle numbers, you actually go halfway between these two numbers."
Math,"You're essentially taking the arithmetic mean of these two numbers to find the median. So the median is going to be halfway in-between 3 and 4, which is going to be 3.5. So the median in this case is 3.5. So if you have an even number of numbers, the median or the middle two, the-- essentially the arithmetic mean of the middle two, or halfway between the middle two. If you have an odd number of numbers, it's a little bit easier to compute. And just so that we see that, let me give you another data set."
Math,"Let's say our data set-- and I'll order it for us-- let's say our data set was 0, 7, 50, I don't know, 10,000, and 1 million. Let's say that is our data set. Kind of a crazy data set. But in this situation, what is our median? Well, here we have five numbers. We have an odd number of numbers. So it's easier to pick out a middle. The middle is the number that is greater than two of the numbers and is less than two of the numbers. It's exactly in the middle. So in this case, our median is 50."
Math,"Now, the third measure of central tendency, and this is the one that's probably used least often in life, is the mode. And people often forget about it. It sounds like something very complex. But what we'll see is it's actually a very straightforward idea. And in some ways, it is the most basic idea. So the mode is actually the most common number in a data set, if there is a most common number."
Math,"If all of the numbers are represented equally, if there's no one single most common number, then you have no mode. But given that definition of the mode, what is the single most common number in our original data set, in this data set right over here? Well, we only have one 4. We only have one 3. But we have two 1's. We have one 6 and one 7. So the number that shows up the most number of times here is our 1. So the mode, the most typical number, the most common number here is a 1."
Math,"So, you see, these are all different ways of trying to get at a typical, or middle, or central tendency. But they do it in very, very different ways. And as we study more and more statistics, we'll see that they're good for different things. This is used very frequently. The median is really good if you have some kind of crazy number out here that could have otherwise skewed the arithmetic mean."
Math,"The mode could also be useful in situations like that, especially if you do have one number that's showing up a lot more frequently. Anyway, I'll leave you there. And we'll-- the next few videos, we will explore statistics even deeper.."
Math,"Sometimes it's called the arithmetic mean because you'll learn that there's other ways of actually calculating a mean. But it's really you just sum up all the numbers and you divide by the numbers there are. And so it's one way of measuring the central tendency. The average, I guess, we could say. So this is our mean. We want to average 23 plus 29-- or we're going to sum 23 plus 29 plus 20 plus 32 plus 23 plus 21 plus 33 plus 25, and then divide that by the number of numbers."
Math,"So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 numbers. So you want to divide that by 8. So let's figure out what that actually is. Actually, I'll just get the calculator out for this part. I could do it by hand, but we'll save some time over here. So we have 23 plus 29 plus 20 plus 32 plus 23 plus 21 plus 33 plus 25. So the sum of all the numbers is 206. And then we want to divide 206 by 8. So if I say 206 divided by 8 gets us 25.75. So the mean is equal to 25.75."
Math,"So this is one way to kind of measure the center, the central tendency. Another way is with the median. And this is to pick out the middle number, the median. And to figure out the median, what we want to do is order these numbers from least to greatest. So it looks like the smallest number here is 20. Then, the next one is 21. There's no 22 here. Let's see, there's two 23's. 23 and a 23. So 23 and a 23. And no 24's. There's a 25. There's no 26, 27, 28. There is a 29. Then you have your 32."
Math,"And then you have your 33. So what's the middle number now that we've ordered it? So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 numbers. We already knew that. And so there's actually going to be two middles. If you have an even number, there's actually two numbers that qualify for close to the middle. And to actually get the median, we're going to average them. So 23 will be one of them. That, by itself, can't be the median because there's three less than it and there's four greater than it."
Math,"And 25 by itself can't be the median because there's three larger than it and four less than it. So what we do is we take the mean of these two numbers and we pick that as the median. So if you take 23 plus 25 divided by 2, that's 48 over 2, which is equal to 24. So even though 24 isn't one of these numbers, the median is 24. So this is the middle number. So once again, this is one way of thinking about central tendency. If you wanted a number that could somehow represent the middle."
Math,"And I want to be clear, there's no one way of doing it. This is one way of measuring the middle. Let me put that in quotes. The middle. If you had to represent this data with one number. And this is another way of representing the middle. Then finally, we can think about the mode. And the mode is just the number that shows up the most in this data set. And all of these numbers show up once, except we have the 23, it shows up twice. And since because 23 shows up the most, it shows up twice."
Math,"Every other number shows up once, 23 is our mode.."
Math,"And at first you're really worried, your whole system of keeping records seems to... you know, you've lost information. But then you remember that every time you wrote down a new age that month, you recalculated the mean. And so you have the mean here of being four, the mean age is four for the six children."
Math,"So given that, given that you know the mean, and that you know five out of six of the ages, can you figure out what the sixth age is? And I encourage you to pause the video and try to figure it out on your own. So assuming you've had a shot at it. So let's just call this missing age, let's call that question mark. So let's just think about how do we calculate, how would we calculate a mean if we knew what question mark is? Well, we would take the total."
Math,"We would take the total of ages, of ages, we would then divide that by the number of children. We then divide that by the number of ages that we had, and then that would be equal to, that would be equal to the mean."
Math,"Or another way to think about it, if you multiply both sides times the number of ages, the number of ages on that side and the number of ages on that side, then this is gonna cancel with that, and we're gonna be left with the total The total is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to the mean times the number of ages. Mean times, and I'll just write times the number, times number of data points, or number of ages."
Math,"So maybe we can use this information, 'cause we're just going to have this missing question mark here and we know the mean and we know the number of ages. So we just have to solve for the question mark. So let's do that. So let's go back to the beginning here, just so this makes sense with some numbers. The total of ages, that's going to be five plus two plus question mark, plus question mark, plus two, this two, plus two plus four plus eight. We're gonna divide by the number of ages."
Math,"We're gonna divide it by the number of ages. Well we have six ages here. One, two, three, four, five, six. Six ages. And that's going to be equal to the mean. This is going to be equal to the mean. The mean here is four. So let's see, and this is just how you calculate the mean. So let's see if we can simplify this. So five plus two is seven. Let me do this, that's the wrong color. Five plus two, five plus two is seven. Two plus four is six plus eight is 14. And then seven plus 14 is 21."
Math,"So we're left with 21 plus question mark over six is equal to four. Now we can do what we did when we just wrote it all out. We can multiply both sides times the number of ages, the number of data points we have. So we can multiply both sides times six. We can multiply both sides, both sides times six. So six on that side, six on this side. Six in the numerator, six in the denominator, those cancel. So all we're left is, on the left-hand side we're left with 21 plus question mark. Alright."
Math,"All of these other green numbers, those just simplified, five plus two plus two plus four plus eight is 21 and we still have the question mark. So we get 21 plus question mark, I want to do that green color, 21 plus this question mark, the thing that we're trying to solve for. The missing number is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to four times six. Well what's four times six? That's 24."
Math,"And so what's the question mark? 21 plus what is equal to 24? And we could, of course, you might just say, well it's gonna be three. Or, if you want to, you could say well, question mark is going to be, question mark is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to 24 minus 21. Which is, of course, three. Which of course, so let me just write this down, so the question mark is equal to three."
Math,"So the missing age, you were able to figure it out based on the information you had, because you had the mean, you were able to figure out that behind this blotch, that behind this blotch you had a three. It's exciting.."
Math,"The lowest round she scores an 80, she also scores a 90 once, a 92 once, a 94 once, and a 96 once. ""It was discovered that Ana broke some rules when she scored ""80, so that score"", so I guess cheating didn't help her, ""so that score will be removed from the data set."" So they removed that 80 right over there. We're just left with the scores from the other four rounds. ""How will the removal of the lowest round ""affect the mean and the median?"" So let's actually think about the median first."
Math,So the median is the middle number. So over here when you had five data points the middle data point is gonna be the one that has two to the left and two to the right. So the median up here is going to be 92. The median up there is 92. And what's the median once you remove this? Now you only have four data points. When you're trying to find the median of an even number of numbers you look at the middle two numbers. So that's a 92 and a 94. And then you take the average of them.
Math,"You go halfway between them to figure out the median. So the median here is going to be, let me do that a little bit clearer. The median over here is going to be halfway between 92 and 94 which is 93. So the median, the median is 93. Median is 93. So removing the lowest data point in this case increased the median. So the median, let me write it down here. So the median increased by a little bit. The median increases."
Math,"Now what's going to happen to the mean? What's going to happen to the mean? Well one way to think about it without having to do any calculations is if you remove a number that is lower than the mean, lower than the existing mean, and I haven't calculated what the existing mean is, but if you remove that the mean is going to go up. The mean is going to go up. So hopefully that gives you some intuition."
Math,"If you removed a number that's larger than the mean your mean is, your mean is going to go down cause you don't have that large number anymore. If you remove a number that's lower than the mean, well you take that out, you don't have that small number bringing the average down and so the mean will go up. But let's verify it mathematically. So let's calculate the mean over here. So we're gonna add 80, plus 90, plus 92, plus 94, plus 96. Those are our data points."
Math,"And that gets us: two plus four is six, plus six is 12. And then we have one plus eight is nine, and this is, so these are nine and then you have another nine, another nine, another nine, another nine. You essentially have, this is five nines right over here. So this is going to be 452. So that's the sum of the scores of these five rounds, and then you divide it by the number of rounds you have. So it would be 452 divided by five."
Math,"So 452 divided by five is going to give us, five goes into, it doesn't go into four, it goes into 45 nine times. Nine times five is 45, you subtract, get zero, bring down the two. Five goes into two zero times, zero times five is, zero times five is zero, subtract. You have two left over, so you can say that the mean here, the mean here is 90 and 2/5. Not nine and 2/5, 90 and 2/5. So the mean is right around here. So that's the mean of these data points right over there."
Math,"And if you remove it what is the mean going to be? So here we're just going to take our 90, plus our 92, plus our 94, plus our 96, add 'em together. So let's see, two plus four plus six is 12. And then you add these together you're gonna get 37. 372 divided by four, cause I have four data points now, not five. Four goes into, let me do this in a place where you can see it. So four goes into 372, goes into 37 nine times. Nine times four is 36, subtract, you get a one."
Math,"Bring down the two, it goes exactly three times. Three times four is 12. You have no remainder. So the median and the mean here are both, so this is also the mean. The mean here is also 93. So you see that the median, the median went from 92 to 93, it increased. The mean went from 90 and 2/5 to 93. So the mean increased by more than the median. They both increased but the mean increased by more. And it makes sense cause this number was way, way below all of these over here."
Math,"So you could imagine if you take this out the mean should increase by a good amount. But let's see which of these choices are what we just described. ""Both the mean and the median will decrease"", nope. ""Both the mean and the median will decrease"", nope. ""Both the mean and the median will increase, ""but the mean will increase by more than the median."" That's exactly, that's exactly, what happened. The mean went from 90 and 2/5 or 90.4, went from 90.4 or 90 and 2/5 to 93."
Math,And then the median only increased by one. So this is the right answer..
Math,"Their high scores are all between 180 and 220, except for Adam, whose high score is 250. Adam then bowls a great game and has a new high score of 290. How will increasing Adam's high score affect the mean and median? Now, like always, pause this video and see if you can figure this out yourself. All right, so let's just think about what they're saying."
Math,"We have four friends, and they each keep track of their all-time high score, so we're gonna have four data points, an all-time high score for each of the friends. So let's see, this is the lowest score of the friends, this is the second lowest, second to highest, and this is the highest scoring of the friends. So let's see. Their high scores are all between 100 and 220, except for Adam, whose high score is 250. So before Adam bowls this super-awesome game, the scores look something like this."
Math,"The lowest score is 180. Adam scores 250. And if you take Adam out of the picture, the highest score is a 220. And we actually don't know what this score right over there is. Now, after Adam bowls a great new game and has a new high score of 290, what does the data set look like? Well, this guy's high score hasn't changed. This guy's high score hasn't changed. This guy's high score hasn't changed. But now Adam has a new high score. Instead of 250, it is now 290."
Math,"So my question is, well, the first question is, does this change the median? Well, remember the median is the middle number. And if we're looking at four numbers here, the median is going to be the average of the middle two numbers. So we're gonna take the average of whatever this question mark is and 220. That's going to be the median."
Math,"Now, over here, after Adam has scored a new high score, how do we calculate the median? Well, we still have four numbers, and the middle two are still the same two middle numbers. Whatever this friend's highest score was, it hasn't changed, and so we're gonna have the same median. It's gonna be 220 plus question mark, divided by two. It's gonna be halfway between question mark and 220. So our median won't change. So median, no change. Median, no change. So let's think about the mean now."
Math,"Well, the mean, you take the sum of all these numbers and then you divide by four, and then you take the sum of all these numbers and divide by four. So which sum is going to be higher? Well, the first three numbers are the same, but in the second list you have a higher number. 290 is higher than 250. So if you take these four and divide by four, you're going to have a larger value than if you take these four and divide by four, because their sum is gonna be larger. And so the mean is going to go up."
Math,"The mean will increase. The mean will increase. So median, no change, and mean, increase. All right, so this says both increase. No, that's not right. The median will increase. No, median doesn't change. The mean will increase. Yep. And the median will stay the same. Yep, that's exactly what we're talking about. And if you wanna make it a little bit more tangible, you can replace question mark with some number. You could replace it, maybe this question mark is 200."
Math,"And if you try it out with 200, just to make things tangible, you're going to see that that is indeed going to be the case. The median would be halfway between these two numbers. And I just arbitrarily picked 200. It could be any number some place between 180 and 220, but you see, for this example, it's very tangibly that the median does not change. But the mean increases, 'cause we increase the sum. We increase the sum by 40, because we've increased this last number, and only the last number, by 40.."
Math,"Sort the data from least to greatest and then find the interquartile range of the data set and I encourage you to do this before I take a shot at it. Alright, so let's first sort it and if we were actually doing this on the Khan Academy exercise, you could just drag these, you could just click and drag these numbers around to sort 'em but I'll just do it by hand. So let's see, the lowest number here looks like it's a four."
Math,"So I have that four then I have another four and then I have another four and let's see, are there any fives? No fives but there is a six. So then there is a six and then there's a seven. There doesn't seem to be an eight or a nine but then we get to a 10 and then we get to 11, 12. No 13 but then we got 14 and then finally we have a 15. So the first thing we wanna do is figure out the median here. So the median's the middle number."
Math,"I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine numbers so there's going to be just one middle number. I have an odd number of numbers here and it's going to be the number that has four to the left and four to the right and that middle number, the median is going to be 10. Notice I have four to the left and four to the right and the interquartile range is all about figuring out the difference between the middle of the first half and the middle of the second half."
Math,"It's a measure of spread, how far apart all of these data points are and so let's figure out the middle of the first half. So we're gonna ignore the median here and just look at these first four numbers and so out of these first four numbers, since I have an even number of numbers, I'm gonna calculate the median using the middle two numbers so I'm gonna look at the middle two numbers here and I'm gonna take their average."
Math,"So the average of four and six, halfway between four and six is five or you could say four plus six is, four plus six is equal to 10 but then I wanna divide that by two so this is going to be equal to five. So the middle of the first half is five. You can imagine it right over there and then the middle of the second half I'm gonna have to do the same thing. I have four numbers. I'm gonna look at the middle two numbers. The middle two numbers are 12 and 14."
Math,"The average of 12 and 14 is going to be 13, is going to be 13. If you took 12 plus 14 over two, that's going to be 26 over two which is equal to 13 but an easier way for numbers like this, you say hey, 13 is right exactly halfway between 12 and 14. So there you have it. I have the middle of the first half is five. I have the middle of the second half, 13. To calculate the interquartile range, I just have to find the difference between these two things."
Math,"So the interquartile range for this first example is going to be 13 minus five. The middle of the second half minus the middle of the first half which is going to be equal to eight. Let's do some more of these. This is strangely fun. Find the interquartile range of the data in the dot plot below. Songs on each album in Shane's collection and so let's see what's going on here and like always, I encourage you to take a shot at it."
Math,"So this is just representing the data in a different way but we could write this again as an ordered list so let's do that. We have one song or we have one album with seven songs I guess you could say. So we have a seven. We have two albums with nine songs so we have two nines. Let me write those, we have two nines then we have three 10s. Cross those out. So 10, 10, 10 then we have an 11. We have an 11."
Math,"We have two 12s, two 12s and then finally, we have, I used those already and then we have an album with 14 songs. So all I did here is I wrote this data like this so we could see, okay, this album has seven songs, this album has nine, this album has nine and the way I wrote it, it's already in order so I could immediately get, I can immediately start calculating the median. Let's see, I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 numbers."
Math,"I have an even number of numbers so to calculate the median, I'm gonna have to look at the middle two numbers. So the middle two numbers look like it's these two 10s here because I have four to the left of them and then four to the right of them and so since I'm calculating the median using two numbers, it's going to be halfway between them. It's going to be the average of these two numbers. Well, the average of 10 and 10 is just going to be 10. So the median is going to be 10."
Math,"Median is going to be 10 and in a case like this where I calculated the median using the middle two numbers, I can now include this left 10 in the first half and I can include this right 10 in the second half. So let's do that. So the first half is going to be those five numbers and then the second half is going to be these five numbers and it makes sense 'cause I'm literally just looking at first half it's gonna be five numbers, second half is gonna be five numbers."
Math,"If I had a true middle number like the previous example then we ignore that when we look at the first and second half or at least that's the way that we're doing it in these examples but what's the median of this first half if we look at these five numbers? Well, if you have five numbers, if you have an odd number of numbers, you're gonna have one middle number and it's going to be the one that has two on either sides. This has two to the left and it has two to the right."
Math,"So the median of the first half, the middle of the first half is nine right over here and the middle of the second half, I have one, two, three, four, five numbers and this 12 is right in the middle. You have two to the left and two to the right so the median of the second half is 12. Interquartile range is just going to be the median of the second half, 12 minus the median of the first half, nine which is going to be equal to three."
Math,"So if I was doing this on the actual exercise, I would fill out a three right over there.."
Math,"This is really a way of seeing the spread of all of the different data points, which are the age of the trees, and to also give other information like, what is the median? And where do most of the ages of the trees sit? So this whisker part, so you could see this black part is a whisker, this is the box, and then this is another whisker right over here. The whiskers tell us essentially the spread of all of the data. So it says the lowest to data point in this sample is an eight-year-old tree."
Math,"I'm assuming that this axis down here is in the years. And it says at the highest-- the oldest tree right over here is 50 years. So if we want the range-- and when we think of range in a statistics point of view we're thinking of the highest data point minus the lowest data point. So it's going to be 50 minus 8. So we have a range of 42. So that's what the whiskers tell us. It tells us that everything falls between 8 and 50 years, including 8 years and 50 years."
Math,"Now what the box does, the box starts at-- well, let me explain it to you this way. This line right over here, this is the median. And so half of the ages are going to be less than this median. We see right over here the median is 21. So this box-and-whiskers plot tells us that half of the ages of the trees are less than 21 and half are older than 21. And then these endpoints right over here, these are the medians for each of those sections."
Math,So this is the median for all the trees that are less than the real median or less than the main median. So this is in the middle of all of the ages of trees that are less than 21. This is the middle age for all the trees that are greater than 21 or older than 21. And so we're actually splitting all of the data into four groups. This we would call the first quartile. So I'll call it Q1 for our first quartile. Maybe I'll do 1Q. This is the first quartile.
Math,"Roughly a fourth of the tree, because the way you calculate it, sometimes a tree ends up in one point or another, about a fourth of the trees end up here. A fourth of the trees are between 14 and 21. A fourth are between 21 and it looks like 33. And then a fourth are in this quartile. So we call this the first quartile, the second quartile, the third quartile, and the fourth quartile. So to answer the question, we already did the range."
Math,"There's a 42-year spread between the oldest and the youngest And then the median age of a tree in the forest is at 21. So even though you might have trees that are as old as 50, the median of the forest is actually closer to the lower end of our entire spectrum of all of the ages. So if you view median as your central tendency measurement, it's only at 21 years. And you can even see it. It's closer to the left of the box and closer to the end of the left whisker than the end of the right whisker.."
Math,"So here are all the distances traveled. He wants to create a graph that helps him understand the spread of the distances-- this is a key word-- the spread of distances and the median distance that people traveled or that people travel. What kind of graph should he create? So the answer of what kind of graph he should create, that might be a little bit more straightforward than the actual creation of the graph, which we will also do. But he's trying to visualize the spread of information."
Math,"And at the same time, he wants the median. So what a graph captures both of that information? Well, a box and whisker plot. So let's actually try to draw a box and whisker plot. And to do that, we need to come up with the median. And we'll also see the median of the two halves of the data as well. And whenever we're trying to take the median of something, it's really helpful to order our data. So let's start off by attempting to order our data. So what is the smallest number here? Well, let's see."
Math,"There's one 2. So let me mark it off. And then we have another two. So we've got all the 2's. And then we have this 3. Then we have this 3. I think we've got all the 3's. Then we have that 4. Then we have this 4. Do we have any 5's? Do we have any 6's? We have that 6. And that looks like the only 6. Any 7's? We have this 7 right over here. And I just realized that I missed this 1. So let me put the 1 at the beginning of our set. So I got that 1 right over there. Actually, there was two 1's."
Math,"I missed both of them. So both of those 1's are right over there. So I have the 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, no 5's. This is one 6. There was one 7. There's one 8 right over here. And then, let's see, any 9's? No 9's. Any 10s? There's a 10. Any 11s? We have an 11 right over there. Any 12s? 13, 14? Then we have a 15. And then we have a 20 and then a 22. So we've ordered all our data. Now it should be relatively straightforward to find the middle of our data, the median."
Math,"So how many data points do we have? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. So the middle number is going to be a number that has 8 numbers larger than it and 8 numbers smaller than it. So let's think about it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So the number 6 here is larger than 8 of the values. And if I did the calculations right, it should be smaller than 8 of the values. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So it is, indeed, the median."
Math,"Now, when we're trying to construct a box and whisker plot, the convention is, OK, we have our median. And it's essentially dividing our data into two sets. Now, let's take the median of each of those sets. And the convention is to take our median out and have the sets that are left over. Sometimes people leave it in. But the standard convention, take this median out. And now, look separately at this set and look separately at this set."
Math,"So if we look at this first bottom half of our numbers essentially, what's the median of these numbers? Well, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 data points. So we're actually going to have two middle numbers. So the two middle numbers are this 2 and this 3, three numbers less than these two, three numbers greater than it. And so when we're looking for a median, you have two middle numbers. We take the mean of these two numbers. So halfway in between two and three is 2.5."
Math,"Or you can say 2 plus 3 is 5 divided by 2 is 2.5. So here we have a median of this bottom half of 2.5. And then the middle of the top half, once again, we have 8 data points. So our middle two numbers are going to be this 11 and this 14. And so if we want to take the mean of these two numbers, 11 plus 14 is 25. Halfway in between the two is 12.5. So 12.5 is exactly halfway between 11 and 14."
Math,"And now, we've figured out all of the information we need to actually plot or actually create or actually draw our box and whisker plot. So let me draw a number line, so my best attempt at a number So that's my number line. And let's say that this right over here is a 0. I need to make sure I get all the way up to 22 or beyond 22. So let's say that's 0. Let's say this is 5. This is 10. That could be 15. And that could be 20. This could be 25. We could keep going-- 30, maybe 35."
Math,"So the first thing we might want to think about-- there's several ways to draw it. We want to think about the box part of the box and whisker essentially represents the middle half of our data. So it's essentially trying to represent this data right over here, so the data between the medians of the two halves. So this is a part that we would attempt to represent with the box. So we would start right over here at this 2.5."
Math,"This is essentially separating the first quartile from the second quartile, the first quarter of our numbers from the second quarter of our numbers. So let's put it right over here. So this is 2.5. 2.5 is halfway between 0 and 5. So that's 2.5. And then up here, we have 12.5. And 12.5 is right over-- let's see. This is 10. So this right over here would be halfway between, well, halfway between 10 and 15 is 12.5. So let me do this. So this is 12.5 right over here."
Math,"So that separates the third quartile from the fourth quartile. And then our boxes, everything in between, so this is literally the middle half of our numbers. And we'd want to show where the actual median is. And that was actually one of the things we wanted to be able to think about when the owner of the restaurant wanted to think about how far people are traveling from. So the median is 6. So we can plot it right over here. So this right here is about six. Let me do that same pink color."
Math,"So this right over here is 6. And then the whiskers of the box and whisker plot essentially show us the range of our data. And I can do this in a different color that I haven't used yet. I'll do this in orange. So essentially, if we want to see, look, the numbers go all the way up to 22. So they go all the way up to-- so let's say that this is 22 right over here. Our numbers go all the way up to 22. And they go as low as 1. So 1 is right about here. Let me label that. So that's 1. And they go as low as 1."
Math,"So there you have it. We have our box and whisker plot. And you can see if you have a plot like this, just visually, you can immediately see, OK, what is the median? It's the middle of the box, essentially. It shows you the middle half. So it shows you how far they're spread or where the meat of the spread is."
Math,"And then it shows, well, beyond that, we have the range that goes well beyond that or how far the total spread of our data So this gives a pretty good sense of both the median and the spread of our data.."
Math,"So, we have a bunch of data, here, and they say if it helps, you might drag the numbers to put them in a different order. So, we can drag these numbers around, which is useful, because we will want to order them. The order isn't checked with your answer, and I'm doing this off of the Khan Academy exercises, so I don't have my drawing tablet here."
Math,"I just have my mouse, and I'm interacting with the exercise, which I encourage you to do too, because the best way to learn any of this stuff is to actually practice it, and at Khan Academy, we have 150,000 exercises for you to practice with. Anyway, so, let's do this. Let's order this thing, so we can figure out the range of numbers. What's the lowest and what's the highest? Let's see, there's a seven here. Then, let's see, we have some eights. We've got some eights goin' on."
Math,"Then we have some nines, actually we have a bunch of nines, we have four nines here. We have some nines, and then, let's see, 13 is the largest number. There we go, we've ordered the numbers. So, our smallest number is seven, and this is what the whiskers are useful for. For helping us figure out the entire range of numbers. Our smallest number is seven. Our largest number is 13, so we know the range."
Math,"Now, let's plot the median, and this'll help us once getting this center line of our box, but then also we need to do that, to figure out what these other lines are, that kind of define the box. To define the middle two fourths of our number. Of our data, or the middle two quartiles. Roughly the middle two quartiles, it depends how some of the numbers work out. But this middle line is going to be the median of our entire data set. Now, the median is just the middle number."
Math,"If we sort them in order, median is just the middle number. We have 11 numbers here. So, the middle one is gonna have five on either side. It's just gonna be this nine. If we had 10 numbers here, if we had an even number of numbers, you actually would of had two middle numbers, and then to find the median, you'd found the mean of those two. If that last sentence was confusing, watch the videos on Khan Academy, on median, and I go into much more detail on that."
Math,"But here, I have 11 numbers, so my median is going to be the middle one. It has five larger, five less, it's this nine, right over here. If I had my pen tablet, I would circle it. So, it's this nine. That is the median. Now, we need to figure out what number is half way, what number is the median of the numbers in this bottom half? They told us to exclude the median when we compute the quartiles. So, this was the median. Let's ignore that. So, let's look at all of the numbers below that."
Math,"So, this nine, eight, eight, eight, and seven. So, we have five numbers. What's the median of these five numbers? Well the median's the middle number. That is eight. So, the beginning of our second quartile is gonna be an eight, right over there. We do the same thing for our third quartile. Remember, this was our median of our entire data set. Let's exclude it. Let's look at the top half of the numbers, so to speak. There's five numbers here, in order. So, the middle one, the median of this is 10."
Math,"So, that's gonna be the top of our second quartile. Just like that, we're done. We have constructed our box-and-whisker plot.."
Math,"And they say the order isn't checked, and that's because I'm doing this on Khan Academy exercises. Up here in the top right, where you can't see, there's actually a check answer. So I encourage you to use the exercises yourself, but let's just use this as an example. So the first thing, if I'm going to do a box-and-whiskers, I'm going to order these numbers. So let me order these numbers from least to greatest. So let's see. There's a one here, and we've got some twos."
Math,"We've got some twos here and some threes, some threes, some four-- I have one four and fives. I have a six. I have a seven. I have a couple of eights, and I have a 10. So there you go. I have ordered these numbers from least to greatest, and now, well just like that, I can plot the whiskers, because I see the range. My lowest number is one. So my lowest number is one. My largest number is 10. So the whiskers help me visualize the range. Now let me think about the median of my data set is."
Math,"So my median here is going to be, let's see. I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 numbers. Since I have an even number of numbers, the middle two numbers are going to help define my median, because there's no one middle number. I might say this number right over here, this four, but notice, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven above it, and there's only one, two, three, four, five, six below it. Same thing would have been true for this five."
Math,"So this four and five, the middle is actually in between these two. So when you have an even number of numbers like this, you take the middle two numbers, this four and this five, and you take the mean of the two. So the mean of four and five is going to be four-and-a-half. So that's going to be the median of our entire data set, four-and-a-half, four-and-a-half. And now, I want to figure out the median of the bottom half of numbers and the top half of numbers. And here they say exclude the median."
Math,"Of course I'm going to exclude the median. It's not even included in our data points right here, because our median is 4.5. So now let's take this bottom half of numbers. Let's take this bottom half of numbers right over here and find the middle. So this is the bottom seven numbers. And so the median of those is going to be the one which has three on either side, so it's going to be this two right over here."
Math,"So that right over there is kind of the left boundary of our box, and then for the right boundary, we need to figure out the middle of our top half of numbers. Remember, four and five were our middle two numbers. Our median is right in between at four-and-a-half. So our top half of numbers starts at this five and goes to this 10. Seven numbers. The middle one's going to have three on both sides. The seven has three to the left, remember of the top half, and three to the right."
Math,"And so the seven is, I guess you could say the right side of our box. And we're done. We've constructed our box-and-whiskers plot, which helps us visualize the entire range but also you could say the middle, roughly the middle half of our numbers.."
Math,"Pause the video, look at these statements, and think about which of these, based on the information in the box and whiskers plot, which of these are for sure true, which of these are for sure false, and which of these we don't have enough information, it could go either way. Alright, so let's work through these. So the first statement is that all of the students are less than 17 years old. Well we see, right over here, that the maximum age, that's the right end of this right whisker is 16."
Math,"So it is the case that all of the students are less than 17 years old. So this is definitely going to be true. The next statement. At least 75% of the students are 10 years old or older. So, when you look at this, this feels right, because 10 is, 10 is the value that is at the beginning of the second quartile. This is the second quartile right over there. And actually, let me do this, let me do this in a different color. So, this is the second quartile."
Math,"So 25% of the value of the numbers are in the second, or roughly, sometimes it's not exactly, so approximately, I'll say roughly 25% are going to be in this second quartile, approximately 25% are going to be in the third quartile, and approximately 25% are going to be in the fourth quartile. So it seems reasonable for saying 10 years old or older that this is going to be, this is going to be true. In fact, you could even have a couple of values in the first quartile that are 10."
Math,"But to make that a little more tangible, let's look at some, so I'm feeling, I'm feeling good that this is true, but let's look a few more examples to make this a little more concrete. So they don't know, we don't know, based on the information here exactly how many students are at the party. We'll have to construct some scenarios. So we could do a scenario, let's see if we can do..."
Math,"We could do a scenario where well let's see, let's see if I can, I can construct something where, let's see, the median is 13. We know that for sure. The median is 13, so if I have an odd number, I would have 13 in the middle, just like that, and maybe I have three on either side. And I'm just making that number up. I'm just trying to see what I can learn about different types of data sets that could be described by this box and whiskers plot. So 10 is going to be the middle of the bottom half."
Math,"So that's 10 right over there. And 15 is going to be the middle of the top half. That's what this box and whiskers plot is telling us. And they of course tell us what the minimum, the minimum is seven. And they tell us that the maximum is 16. So we know that's seven and then that is 16. And then this, right over here, could be anything. It could be 10, it could be 11, it could be 12, it could be 13. It wouldn't change what these medians are. It wouldn't change this box and whiskers plot."
Math,"Similarly, this could be 13, it could be 14, it could be 15, and so any of those values wouldn't change it. And so 75% are 10 or older, well, this value, in this case, six out of seven are 10 years old or older. And we could try it out with other, other scenarios where... let's try to minimize the number of 10s given this data set. Well we could do something like, let's say that we have eight. So let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
Math,"And so here we know that the minimum, we know that the minimum is seven, we know that the maximum is 16. We know, we know that the, we know that the mean of these middle two values, we have an even number now so, the median is going to be the mean of these two values. So, it's going to be the mean of this and this, is going to be 13. And we know that the mean of, we know that the mean of this and this is going to be 10 and that the mean of this and this is going to be, is going to be 15."
Math,"So what could we construct? Well actually, we don't even have to construct to answer this question. We know that, we know that this is going, this is going to have to be 10 or larger. And then all of these other things are going to be 10 or larger, so this is exactly 75%. Exactly 75% if we assume that this is less than 10, are going to be 10 years old or older. So feeling very good, very good, about this one right over here. And actually, just to make this concrete, I'll put in some values here."
Math,"You know this could be, this could be a nine and an 11. This could be a 12 and a 14. This could be a 14 and a 16. Or, it could be, it could be a 15 and a 15. You could think about it and in any of those, in any of those ways. But feeling very good that this is definitely going to be true based on the information given in this plot. Now they say there's only one seven-year-old at the party. One seven-year-old at the party. Well this first, this first possibility that we looked at, that was the case."
Math,"There was only one seven-year-old at the party and there was one 16-year-old at the party. And actually, that was the next statement, there's only one 16-year-old at the party. So both of these seem like we can definitely construct data that's consistent with this box plot, box and whiskers plot, where this is true. But could we construct one where it's not true? Well sure. Let's imagine, let's see, we have our median at 13. Median at 13. And then we have, let's see, one, two, three, four, five."
Math,"One, two, three, four, five. This is gonna be, this is gonna be the 10, the median of this bottom half. This is going to be 15. This is going to be seven. This is going to be 16. Well this could also be seven. It doesn't have to be. It could be seven, eight, nine, or ten. This could also be 16. Doesn't have to be. It could be 15 as well. But just like that, I've constructed a data set, and these could be, you know this could be 10, 11, 12, 13. This could be 10, 11, 12, 13. This could be 13, 14, 15."
Math,"This one also could be 13, 14, 15. But the simple thing is, or the basic idea here, I can have a data set where I have multiple sevens and multiple 16s, or I could have a data set where I only have one seven or only one 16. So both of these statements, we just plain don't know. We just don't, we just don't know. Now the next statement, exactly half the students are older than 13. Well if you look at this possibility up here, we saw that three out of the seven are older than 13. So that's not exactly half."
Math,"3/7 is not 1/2. But in this one over here, we did see that exactly half are over, are older than 13. In fact, if you're saying exactly half... Well, in this one we're saying that exactly half are older than 13. We have an even number right over here. And so it is exactly half. So it's possible that it's true, it's possible that it's not true based on the information given. We once again, we once again don't, we once again do not know. Anyway, hopefully you found this interesting."
Math,"This is, the whole point of me doing this is when you look at statistics, sometimes it's easy to kind of say, okay I think it roughly means that, and that's sometimes okay. But it's very important to think about what types of actual statements you can make and what you can't make and it's very important when you're looking at statistics to say, well you know what, I just don't know. That the data actually is not telling me that thing for sure.."
Math,"We'll do this on the right side of the screen. A one, a one, a six, and a four. Now, the first thing I wanna think about is, ""Well, how do I ... ""Is there a number that can give me ""a measure of center of each of these data sets?"" And one of the ways that we know how to do that is by finding the mean. So let's figure out the mean of each of these data sets. This first data set, the mean ... Well, we just need to sum up all of the numbers. That's gonna be two plus two plus four plus four."
Math,"And then we're gonna divide by the number of numbers that we have. So we have one, two, three, four numbers. That's that four right over there. And this is going to be, two plus two is four, plus four is eight, plus four is 12. This is gonna be 12 over four, which is equal to three. Actually, let's see if we can visualize this a little bit on a number line. Actually I'll do kind of a ... I'll do a little bit of a dot plot here so we can see all of the values."
Math,"If this is zero, one, two, three, four, and five. We have two twos. Why don't I just do ... So for each of these twos ... Actually, I'll just do it in yellow. So I have one two, then I have another two. I'm just gonna do a dot plot here. Then I have two fours. So, one four and another four, right over there. And we calculated that the mean is three. The mean is three. A measure of central tendency, it is three. So I'll just put three right over here. I'll just mark it with that dotted line."
Math,"That's where the mean is. All right. Well, we've visualized that a little bit. That does look like it's the center. It's a pretty ... It makes sense. So now let's look at this other data set right over here. The mean, the mean over here is going to be equal to one plus one plus six plus four, all of that over, we still have four data points. And this is two plus six is eight, plus four is 12, 12 divided by four ... This is also three. So this also has the same mean."
Math,"We have different numbers, but we have the same mean. But there's something about this data set that feels a little bit different about this. And let's visualize it, to see if we can see a difference. Let's see if we can visualize it. I have to go all the way up to six. Let's say this is zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, and I'll go one more, seven. So we have a one. We have a one, we have another one. We have a six. And then we have a four. And we calculated that the mean is three."
Math,"So we calculated that the mean is three. So the mean is three. When we measure it by the mean, the central point, or measure of that central point which we use as the mean, well, it looks the same, but the data sets look different. How do they look different? Well, we've talked about notions of variability or variation. And it looks like this data set is more spread out. It looks like the data points are on average further away from the mean than these data points are."
Math,"That's an interesting question that we ask ourselves in statistics. We just don't want a measure of center, like the mean. We might also want a measure of variability."
Math,"And one of the more straightforward ways to think about variability is, well, on average, how far are each of the data points from the mean? That might sound a little complicated, but we're gonna figure out what that means in a second, (chortles) not to overuse the word ""mean."" So we wanna figure out, on average, how far each of these data points from the mean. And what we're about to calculate, this is called Mean Absolute Deviation. Absolute Deviation."
Math,"Mean Absolute Deviation, or if you just use the acronym, MAD, mad, for Mean Absolute Deviation. And all we're talking about, we're gonna figure out how much do each of these points, their distance, so absolute deviation. How much do the deviate from the mean, but the absolute of it? So each of these points at two, they are one away from the mean. Doesn't matter if they're less or more. They're one away from the mean. And then we find the mean of all of the deviations."
Math,"So what does that mean? (chuckles) I'm using the word ""mean,"" using it a little bit too much. So let's figure out the Mean Absolute Deviation of this first data set. We've been able to figure out what the mean is. The mean is three. So we take each of the data points and we figure out, what's its absolute deviation from the mean? So we take the first two. So we say, two minus the mean. Two minus the mean, and we take the absolute value. So that's its absolute deviation."
Math,"Then we have another two, so we find that absolute deviation from three. Remember, if we're just taking two minus three, taking the absolute value, that's just saying its absolute deviation. How far is it from three? It's fairly easy to calculate in this case. Then we have a four and another four. Let me write that. Then we have the absolute deviation of four from three, from the mean. Then plus, we have another four. We have this other four right up here. Four minus three."
Math,"We take the absolute value, because once again, it's absolute deviation. And then we divide it, and then we divide it by the number of data points we have. So what is this going to be? Two minus three is negative one, but we take the absolute value. It's just going to be one. Two minus three is negative one. We take the absolute value. It's just gonna be one. And you see that here visually. This point is just one away. It's just one away from three. This point is just one away from three."
Math,"Four minus three is one. Absolute value of that is one. This point is just one away from three. Four minus three, absolute value. That's another one. So you see in this case, every data point was exactly one away from the mean. And we took the absolute value so that we don't have negative ones here. We just care how far it is in absolute terms. So you have four data points. Each of their absolute deviations is four away."
Math,"So the mean of the absolute deviations are one plus one plus one plus one, which is four, over four. So it's equal to one. One way to think about it is saying, on average, the mean of the distances of these points away from the actual mean is one. And that makes sense because all of these are exactly one away from the mean. Now, let's see how, what results we get for this data set right over here. And I'll do it ... Let me actually get some space over here."
Math,"At any point, if you get inspired, I encourage you to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation on your own. So let's calculate it. The Mean Absolute Deviation here, I'll write MAD, is going to be equal to ... Well, let's figure out the absolute deviation of each of these points from the mean."
Math,"It's the absolute value of one minus three, that's this first one, plus the absolute deviation, so one minus three, that's the second one, then plus the absolute value of six minus three, that's the six, then we have the four, plus the absolute value of four minus three. Then we have four points. So one minus three is negative two. Absolute value is two. And we see that here. This is two away from three. We just care about absolute deviation. We don't care if it's to the left or to the right."
Math,"Then we have another one minus three is negative two. It's absolute value, so this is two. That's this. This is two away from the mean. Then we have six minus three. Absolute value of that is going to be three. And that's this right over here. We see this six is three to the right of the mean. We don't care whether it's to the right or the left. And then four minus three. Four minus three is one, absolute value is one. And we see that. It is one to the right of three."
Math,"And so what do we have? We have two plus two is four, plus three is seven, plus one is eight, over four, which is equal to two. So the Mean Absolute Deviation ... Let me write it down. It fell off over here. Here, for this data set, the Mean Absolute Deviation is equal to two, while for this data set, the Mean Absolute Deviation is equal to one. And that makes sense. They have the exact same means. They both have a mean of three. But this one is more spread out."
Math,"The one on the right is more spread out because, on average, each of these points are two away from three, while on average, each of these points are one away from three. The means of the absolute deviations on this one is one. The means of the absolute deviations on this one is two. So the green one is more spread out from the mean.."
Math,"I'm gonna do that by calculating the mean absolute deviation. Pause this video now. Try to calculate the mean of the number of bubbles blown. And then, after you do that, see if you can calculate the mean absolute deviation. Step one, let's figure out the mean. The mean is just going to be the sum of the number of bubbles blown divided by the number of datapoints. Manueala blew four bubbles. She blew four bubbles. Sophia blew five bubbles. Jada blew six bubbles. Tara blew one bubble."
Math,"We have one, two, three, four datapoints. So let's divided by four. And so, this is going to be equal to four plus five is nine, plus six is 15, plus one is 16. So it's equal to 16 over four, which is 16 divided by four is equal to four. The mean number of bubbles blown is four. Lemme actually do this with a bold line right over here. This is the mean number of bubbles blown. Now what I wanna do is I wanna figure out the mean absolute deviation. MAD: Mean Absolute Deviation."
Math,"What we wanna do is we wanna take the mean of how much do each of these datapoints deviate from the mean. I know I just used the word mean twice in a sentence, so it might be a little confusing, but as we work through it, hopefully, it'll make a little bit of sense. How much does Manueala's, the number of bubbles she blew, how much does that deviate from the mean? Well, Manueala actually blew four bubbles, and four is the mean. So her deviation, her absolute deviation from the mean is zero. Is zero."
Math,"Actually, lemme just write this over here. Absolute deviation, that's AD, absolute deviation from the mean. Manueala didn't deviate at all from the mean. Now let's think about Sophia. Sophia deviates by one from the mean. We see that right there, she's one above. Now, we would say one whether it's one above or below, 'cause we're saying absolute deviation. Sophia deviates by one. Her absolute deviation is one. And then, we have Jada. How much does she deviate from the mean? We see it right over here."
Math,"She deviates by two. She is two more than the mean. And then, how much does Tara deviate from the mean? She is at one, so that is three below the mean. That is three below the mean. Once again, this is two, this is three. She deviates. Her absolute deviation is three. And then we wanna take the mean of the absolute deviation. That's the M in MAD, in Mean Absolute Deviation. This is Manueala's absolute deviation, Sophia's absolute deviation, Jada's absolute deviation, Tara's absolute deviation."
Math,"We want the mean of those, so we divide by the number of datapoints, and we get zero plus one, plus two, plus three, is six over four. Six over four, which is the same thing as 1 1/2. Or, lemme just write it in all the different ways. We could write it as three halves, or 1 1/2, or 1.5. Which gives us a measure of how much do these datapoints vary from the mean of four. I know what some of you are thinking. ""Wait, I thought there was a formula ""associated with the mean absolute deviation."
Math,"""It seems really complex. ""It has all of these absolute-value signs ""and whatever else."" That's all we did. When we write all those absolute-value signs, that's just a fancy way of looking at each datapoint, and thinking about how much does it deviate from the mean, whether it's above or below. That's what the absolute value does. It doesn't matter, if it's three below, we just say three. If it's two above, we just say two. We don't put a positive or negative on."
Math,"Just so you're comfortable seeing how this is the exact same thing you would've done with the formula, let's do it that way, as well. So the mean absolute deviation is going to be equal to. Well, we'll start with Manueala. How many bubbles did she blow? She blew four. From that you subtract the mean of four, take the absolute value. That's her absolute deviation. Of course, this does evaluate to this zero, to zero here. Then you take the absolute value. Sophia blew five bubbles, and the mean is four."
Math,"Then you do that for Jada. Jada blew six bubbles; the mean is four. And then you do it for Tara. Tara blew one bubble, and the mean is four. Then you divide it by the number of datapoints you have. Lemme make it very clear. This right over here, this four, is the mean. This four is the mean. You're taking each of the datapoints, and you're seeing how far it is away from the mean. You're taking the absolute value 'cause you just wanna figure out the absolute distance. Now you see, or maybe you see."
Math,"Four minus four, this is. Different color. Four minus four, that is a zero. That is that zero right over there. Five minus four, absolute value of that? That's going to be. Lemme do this in a new color. This is just going to be one. This thing is the same thing as that over there. We were able to see that just by inspecting this graph, or this chart. And then, six minus four, absolute value of that, that's just going to be two."
Math,"That two is that two right over here, which is the same thing as this two right over there. And then, finally, our one minus four, this negative three, but the absolute value of that is just positive three, which is this positive three right over there, which is this distance right over here. You divide it by four, you get 1.5 again. Hopefully you found this mean absolute deviation example as interesting as I did.."
Math,"Which display could be used to find the median? To find the median. All right, so let's look at these displays. So over here we see, this is the dot plot. We have a dot for each of the 14 films. So one film had a running time of 81 minutes. We see that there. One film had a running time of 92. One had a running time of 93. We see one had a running time of 95. We see two had running times of 96 minutes, and so on and so forth."
Math,"So I claim that I could use this to figure out the median, because I could make a list of all of the running times of the films, I could order them, and then I could find the middle value. I could literally make a list. I could write down 81, and then write down 92, then write down 93, then write down 95, then I could write down 96 twice, and then I could write down 98, then I could write down 100. I think you see where this is going."
Math,"I could write out the entire list, and then I could find the middle values. So the dot plot, I could definitely use to find the median. Now, what about the histogram? This is the histogram right over here. And the key here is, for a median, to figure out a median, I just need to figure out a list of numbers. I need to figure out a list of numbers. So here, I don't know, they say I have one film that's between 80 and 85, but I don't know its exact running time."
Math,"Its running time might have been 81 minutes, its running time might have been 84 minutes. So I don't know here, and so I can't really make a list of the running times of the films and find the middle values, so I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it using the histogram. Now, with the box plot right over here, so I'm not gonna click histogram. With the box plot over here, I might not be able to make a list of all the values, but the box plot explicitly tells us what the median is."
Math,"This middle line in the middle of the box, that tells us the median is, what is this, this median is, if this is 100, this is 99. So this is 95, 96, 97, 98, 99. It explicitly tells us the median is 99. This is actually the easiest for calculating the median. So I'll go with the box plot. So the histogram is of no use to me if I wanna calculate the median. Let's do a couple more of these. Nam owns a used car lot. He checked the odometers of the cars and recorded how far they had driven."
Math,"He then created both a histogram and a box plot to display the same data, both diagrams are shown below. Which display can be used to find how many vehicles had driven more than 200,000 kilometers? So how many vehicles had driven more than 200,000 kilometers? So it looks like here in this histogram, I have three vehicles that were between 200 and 250, and then I have two vehicles that are between 250 and 300."
Math,"So it looks pretty clear that I have five vehicles, three that had a mileage between 200,000 and 250,000, and then I had two that had mileage between 250,000 and 300,000. So I may be able to answer the question. Five vehicles had a mileage more than 200,000, and so I would say that the histogram is pretty useful. But let's verify that the box plot isn't so useful. So I wanna know how many vehicles had a mileage more than 200,000."
Math,"Well, I know that if I have a mileage more than 200,000, I'm going to be in the fourth quartile, but I don't know how many values I have sitting there in the fourth quartile just looking at this data over here, so that's not gonna be useful for answering that question. Let's look at the second question."
Math,"Which display can be used to find that the median distance, which display can be used to find that the median distance was approximately 140,000 kilometers? Well, to calculate the median, you essentially wanna be able to list all of the numbers and then find the middle number. And over here, I can't list all of the numbers. I know that there's three values that are between zero and 50,000 kilometers, but I don't know what they are. Could be 10,000, 10,000, 10,000. It could be 10,000, 15,000, and 40,000."
Math,"I don't know what they are, and so if I can't list all of these things and put them in order, I really am going to have trouble finding the middle value. The middle value, it's going to be in this range right around here, but I don't know exactly what it's going to be. The histogram is not useful, because throwing all the values into these buckets. While on the box plot, it explicitly, it directly tells me the median value."
Math,"This line right over here, the middle of the box, this tells us the median value, and we see that the median value here, this is 140,000 kilometers. Right, this is 100, 110, 120, 130, 140,000 kilometers is the median mileage for the cars. And so the box plot clearly... clearly gives us that data.."
Math,"So we don't have any guests that are under the age of 20, we have a reasonable number between 20 and 30, we have a lot of guests at 30, in that bucket between 30 and 40, reasonable number between 40 and 50, and then as we get older, we have fewer and fewer guests. So just when you look at something like this, a distribution like this, something might pop out at you."
Math,"It kind of looks like if you were to imagine this were an armadillo, this would be the body of the armadillo, and then what we see to the right kind of looks like the tail of the armadillo. We actually use those types of words to describe distributions. So this distribution right over here, it looks like it has a tail to the right. It doesn't have a tail to the left. In fact, we have no one under the age of 20."
Math,"But here when we have a few people between 60 and 70, even fewer between 70 and 80, even fewer between 80 and 90, and you know, if it just kind of keeps going like this, this is a tail and it's on the right side, it's a right-tailed distribution. So I'd call this distribution right-tailed. I'm using Khan Academy exercises because it's a good way to see a lot of examples, and frankly, you should too because it'll help you test your knowledge. But it's not left-tailed."
Math,"Left-tailed we would see a tail going like that. Frankly, if you're left-tailed and right-tailed, you're likely to be approximately symmetrical. Remember symmetry, you define a line of symmetry, and one type of symmetry is one where both sides of that line of symmetry are mirror images of each other. You could fold over the line of symmetry, and they'll roughly meet."
Math,"This one does not meet that because if you were to say, hey, maybe there's a line of symmetry here and you tried to fold this over, it wouldn't match up, the two sides would not match up. So I feel good saying that it is right-tailed. So let's see. Retirement of age of each guest. Well yeah, these names aren't that great, but let's actually see what they're saying. They're saying by age, they're telling us the number of guests. So this is the number of guests at Logan Assisted Living."
Math,"So we have a lot of guests that are between 60 and 70 years old, or reasonable that are between 50 and 60, or 70 or 80, and this distribution actually looks pretty symmetrical. If I were to draw a line of symmetry right down here, right at around an age of, you know, the line would be right at an age of 65, I guess you could say all this is a bucket for ages 60 to 70, then you could flip it over and it looks pretty symmetrical."
Math,"Not exactly, this bucket doesn't quite match up to this one, but it's pretty close. These roughly match each other. These roughly match each other. So I feel good about saying it is approximately symmetrical. Now just to know what these other words mean, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right."
Math,"These actually have fairly technical definitions when you get further in statistics, but a, I guess, easier to process version of them are when you're left tailed, you also tend to be skewed to the left, and when you are right-tailed, you tend to be skewed to the right. Another way to think about skewed to the left is that your mean is to the left of your median and mode. That might not make any sense to you. You might just want to off of the tail. If you're left-tailed, you're probably left skewed."
Math,"If you're right-tailed, you're probably right skewed. So let's keep going. Let's see another example. So this interesting. We're not given a histogram here. We're not given a bar graph. We're given a box and whiskers plot, which is really just telling us the different quartiles. So just to remind ourselves, this tells us the minimum of our data set, the bottom of our range, so the minimum value in our data set. We have at least one 11, and then the maximum value of our data set, we have at least one 25."
Math,"Now this line right over here is the median. The middle number is 21. Then the box defines the middle 50% of our numbers. So it's kind of the meat of our distribution. So if we were to try to visualize what this would look like as maybe a histogram, and we don't know for sure because we might have a whole bunch of 11s, not so much that it skews this, but we could have more than one."
Math,"But a distribution that this could match up with is something that looks like having a tail down here, and then you kind of bump up here. This is the meat of the distribution. It kind of looks something like that, and I can't draw because I'm doing this on the exercises right now. But for something like that, well something like that would have a tail to the left, would have a tail to the left. It's range goes fairly low to the left, but it might not have a lot of value there."
Math,"If I had more values on the left side, this box would have been shifted over because a larger percentage would have been on the left, so to speak. So this one, I feel pretty good about saying this is skewed to the left. It's definitely not symmetrical. If it was symmetrical, the median would be pretty close to the center, the box would be pretty centered. It's not skewed to the right."
Math,"If it was skewed to the right, you would have a tail to the right, you would have, this whisker would likely be much, much, much longer. And we're done.."
Math,"So the first statement is the distribution has an outlier. So an outlier is a data point that's way off of where the other data points are, it's way larger or way smaller than where all of the other data points seem to be clustered and if we look over here, we have a lot of data points between zero and six. And let's just think about what they're measuring: this is shelf time for each apple at Gorg's Grocier."
Math,"So, for example, we see there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven apples that have a shelf life of zero days, so (laughs), they're about to go bad. You see you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight apples that are gonna be good for another day. You have two apples that are gonna be good for another six days, and you have one apple that's gonna be good for 10 days, and this is unusual."
Math,"This is an outlier here, it has a way larger shelf life than all of the other data, so I would say this definitely does have an outlier. We just have this one data point sitting all the way to the right, way larger, way more shelf life than everything else, so it definitely has an outlier, and this one would be the outlier. The distribution has a cluster from four to six days. And we indeed do see a cluster from four to six days."
Math,"A cluster, you can imagine, it's a grouping of data that's sitting there, or you have a grouping of apples that have a shelf life between four and six days, and you definitely do see that cluster there. And since I already selected two things, I'm definitely not gonna select none of the above. Let me check my answer. Let me do a few more of these. Which of the following are accurate descriptions of the distribution below? And once again we're going to select all that apply."
Math,"So the distribution has an outlier. So let's see this distribution. I do have a data point here that is at the high end and I have another data point here that's at the low end, but I don't have any data points that are sitting far above or far below the bulk of the data."
Math,"If I had a data point that was out here, then yeah, I would say that was an outlier to the right, or a positive outlier, if I had a data point way to the left off the screen over here, maybe that would be an outlier, but I don't really see any obvious outliers. All of the data, it's pretty clustered together. So I would not say that the distribution has an outlier. The distribution has a peak at 22 degrees."
Math,"Yeah, it does indeed look like we have, and let's just look at what we're actually measuring: high temperature each day in Edgeton, Iowa in July. So it does indeed look like we have the most number of days that had a high temperature at 22, most number of days in July had a high tempurature at 22 degrees Celsius, so that is a peak. You can see it, if you imagine this as kind of a mountain this is a peak right here, this is a high point."
Math,"You have, at least locally, the most number of days at 22 degrees Celsius. So I would say it definitely has a peak there. Since I selected something, I'm not gonna select none of the above. Let's do a couple more of these. Which of the following are accurate descrptions of the distribution below? So the first one, the distribution has an outlier. number of guests by day at Seth's Sandwich Shop. So, let's see, the lowest... They have no days..."
Math,"No days where he had between zero and 19 guests, no days where he had between 20 and 39 guests, looks like there's about nine days where he had between 40 and 59 guests, looks like 20 days where he had between 60 and 79 guests, all the way where it looks like maybe 8 days that he had between 180 and 199 guests. But the question of outliers, there doesn't seem to be any day where he had an unusual number of guests. There's not a day that's way out here, where he had, like, 500 guests."
Math,"So I would say this distribution does not have an outlier. The distribution has a cluster from zero to 39 guests. So zero to 39 guests is right over here, zero to 39 guests. And there is no days where he had between zero and 39 guests neither zero to 19, or 20 to 39. So there's definitely not a cluster there. I would say that the cluster would be between days that had between 40 and 199 guests. Definitely not zero and 39, there was no days that were between zero and 39 guests."
Math,"So I would say none of the above very confidently. Let's do one more of these. Which of the following are accurate descriptions of the distribution below? (laughs) Alright. The distribution has a peak from 12 to 13 points. Let me see what this is measuring, what this data is about. Test scores by student in Mrs. Frine's class. So you had one student who got between a zero and a one on a 20-point scale, so got between, I guess out of 20 questions, got between zero and one point."
Math,"And then you see that there's no students got between two and three, or four and five, or six and seven. Then we have another student who got between eight and nine, looks like three students got between 10 and 11, and then we keep increasing, this looks like about 12 students got either a 16 or a 17, or something in between maybe, if you could get decimal points on that test. And then it looks like 10 students got from 18 to 19."
Math,"Alright, so this says the distribution has a peak from 12 to 13 points, 12 to 13 points, there were five students, but this isn't a peak. If you just go to 14 to 15 points, you have more students. So this is definitely not a peak. If you were looking at this as a mountain of some kind, you definitely wouldn't describe this point as a peak. You would say this distribution has a peak, it has the most number of students who got between 16 and 17 points, so that's the peak right there, not 12 to 13 points."
Math,"So I would not select that first choice. The distribution has an outlier. Well, yeah, look at this: you have this outlier. Most of the students scored between eight and 19 points, and then you have this one student who got between zero and one, it's really an outlier. You even see this when you look at it visually, it's not even connected to the rest of the distribution. It's way to the left. If something is way to the left or way to the right, that's an outlier if it's unusually low or unusually high."
Math,"So I would say this distribution definitely does have an outlier, and I'm not gonna pick none of the above since I found a choice. And I think we're all done.."
Math,"So let's say I'm looking at a recipe for some type of baked goods, maybe it's some type of pancakes, I've been making a lot of those lately, and we know that for a certain number of eggs how many cups of milk we need. So we have number of eggs, and then we're also going to have cups of milk."
Math,"And in this recipe, we know that if we're going to use one egg, then we would use two cups of milk, and if we use three eggs, then we're gonna use six cups of milk, and if we use, let's say, 12 eggs, then we're going to use 24 cups of milk. So is this a proportional relationship where the two variables are the cups of milk and the number of eggs? Well, to test that we just have to think about the ratio between these two variables."
Math,"And you can say that the ratio of the number of eggs to the cups of milk, or the ratio of the cups of milk to the number of eggs. But you just need to ensure that they are always equivalent in these scenarios. So let me make another column here, and I'm gonna think about the ratio of the eggs to the cups of milk. Well, in this first scenario one egg for two cups of milk. This second scenario is three to six. This third scenario is 12 to 24."
Math,"Are these equivalent ratios? Well, to go from one to three you multiply by three, and also, to go from two to six, you multiply by three. So you multiplied both the variables by three. Similarly, if you multiply the number of eggs by four, then you multiply the number of cups of milk by four as well. So these indeed are all equivalent ratios, one to two, three to six, 12 to 24. In every scenario you have twice as much cups of milk as you have number of eggs. So this would be proportional. So check."
Math,"Now what would be an example of a non-proportional relationship? We'll stay in this baked goods frame of mind. Let's say you're going to a cake store and you're curious about how much it would cost to buy a cake for different numbers of people. So let's say number of servings, number of servings in one column, and then the cost of the cake. And let me set up two columns right over here. And so let's say if you have 10 servings, the cake costs $20. If you have 20 servings, the cake costs $30."
Math,"And if you have 40 servings, the cake costs $40. Pause this video and see if you can figure out whether this is a proportional relationship. If it is, why? If it isn't, why not? Alright, well let's just think about the ratios again. And here our two variables are the number of servings and the cost of cake. So if we look at the ratio of the servings, servings, to cost, in this first situation it is 10 to 20, and then it is 20 to 30, and then it is 40 to 40."
Math,"And so to see if these are equivalent ratios, when we go from 10 to 20 on the number of servings, we're multiplying by two. But when we go from 20 to 30 on the cost of the cake, we aren't multiplying by two, we're multiplying by 1.5, or one and a half. And similarly, when we go from 20 to 40, we are multiplying by two again, but to go from 30 to 40 we aren't multiplying by two, we're multiplying by one and one third. By one and one third."
Math,"When we multiply our servings by a given amount, we're not multiplying our cost of cake by the same amount. This tells us that this is not proportional. One way to think about proportional relationships, we already said, that the ratio between the variables will be equivalent. Another way to think about it is one variable will always be some constant times the first variable. So in our first example right over here we said the cups of milk is always two times the number of eggs. We can write that down."
Math,"So cups of milk is always going to be equal to two times the number of eggs. And this number right over here, we call that the constant of proportionality. And you wouldn't be able to set up an equation like this in this scenario. It would have to be more complicated. And so a proportional relationship, the ratios are equivalent between the two variables and you can set it up with an equation like this where you have a constant of proportionality.."
Math,"If Y is proportionate, or is proportional to X, then that means we can say that Y is equal to some constant. Y is equal to some constant times X. And that constant, that is our constant of proportionality, right over there. Sometimes you'll see this expressed, if you divide both sides by X, sometimes you'll see this as Y over X, is equal to the constant of proportionality. It shows for any X-Y pair, if you take your Y divided by X, what do you get? That's the same, same thing."
Math,"So with that out of the way, see if you can answer their question. What is the constant of proportionality between Y and X in the graph? Well they very clearly give us a point right over here, this point is the point three, three comma two. And so we could set it up a few ways. We could say, look when Y is equal to two, X is equal to three, and so two would need to be equal to some constant of proportionality times three. And if you wanted to solve for this, you just divide both sides by the three."
Math,"So divide both sides by three, and you would get your constant of proportionality is two-thirds. Another way to do it, right over here. Well here, we've kind of already solved for our constant of proportionality. When Y, or we could say, when X is three, when X is three, Y is equal to two. In either case, our constant of proportionality is two-thirds. Let's do another example. So here we have which line has a constant of proportionality between Y and X of five over four."
Math,"So pause the video and see if you can figure that out. So the key realization is we should test points on these lines, we should test X-Y pairs, and say, look if we take our Y divided by X, do we get five-fourths? Because that would be our constant of proportionality. So let's first try, let's try line A right over here. So line A, let me find a point that sits on it. so that looks like a point that sits on it. And so if I take, this is the point two comma five."
Math,"And so if I took Y divided by X, I would get a constant of proportionality as five halves. So A is not going to be our answer. We wanna get to a constant of proportionality of five-fourths. Alright, let's try B. Okay B, let me find a point on B. Looks like this is a point on B. That is the point four comma five, four comma five. And so in this situation, K would be our Y, which is five, divided by our X, which is four. So it looks like B is our choice."
Math,"For kicks, you could also look at the constant of proportionality right over here. Now there is one interesting example that I just wanna touch on before we finish these examples. What about a situation where Y is equal to X? What is the constant of proportionality then? And what would it look like as a line? Pause this video and think about it. Well, there's really nothing new here. It's just, you might not really see the constant of proportionality when you see it expressed this way."
Math,"But Y is equal to X, is the same thing as Y is equal to one times X. And so then it might jump out at you that the constant of proportionality is one in this scenario right over here. Or if you took Y divided by X, Y over... Let me do it in that black color. Or if you took Y over X, you divided both sides by X, you would be left with the constant of proportionality, which would be equal to one. And if you wanted to graph it, well it would just look like this. Y would be equal to X, for all X's."
Math,"So that's what when your constant of proportionality is one, you would... Those would represent points on this orange line that I just constructed.."
Math,"If we know that there is a proportional relationship between y and x, then there will be a constant of proportionality between these variables, and what this is, is it is a number that I would have to multiply x by to get to y. So I could make a little table here, as we often do when we describe proportional relationships, x and y. We know that when x is zero, y is zero. But if I multiply zero by anything, I'm gonna get zero. But then when x is one, what is y? When x is one, y is three."
Math,"They mark it right over there. When x is two, what is y? X is two, we see that y is six. So our constant of proportionality is what are we multiplying x by to get to y? Well, let's see, to go from one to three, I have to multiply by three. To go from two to six, I have to multiply by three. Another way to think about it is we could write the equation y is equal to something times x. The number that we multiply x by to get y is our constant of proportionality."
Math,"And we've seen, in all of these situations, this should be true for any point on this line. You give the x, you multiply it by three, you get your y. So the relationship here is y is equal to three x. So three is our constant of proportionality.."
Math,"So let's say we're trying to make some type of baked goods, maybe it's some type of muffin, and we know that depending on how many muffins we're trying to make, that for a given number of eggs, we always want twice as many cups of milk. So we could say cups of milk, cups of milk, that's going to be equal to two times the number of eggs. So what do you think the constant of proportionality is here, sometimes known as the proportionality constant? Well yes, it is going to be two."
Math,"This is a proportional relationship between the cups of milk and the number of eggs. The cups of milk are always going to be two times the number of eggs. Give me the number of eggs, I'm going to multiply it by the constant of proportionality to get the cups of milk. And we can see how this is a proportional relationship a little bit clearer if we set up a table."
Math,"So if we say number of eggs and if we say cups of milk and make a table here, well if you have one egg, how many cups of milk are you gonna have? Well this right over here would be one times two, well you're gonna have two cups of milk. If you had three eggs, well you're just gonna multiply that by two to get your cups of milk, so you're gonna have six cups of milk."
Math,"If you had 1,000,000 eggs, so we have a very big party here, maybe we're some sort of industrial muffin producer, well how many cups of milk? Well you put 1,000,000 in right over here, multiply it by two, you get your cups of milk. You're going to need 2,000,000 cups of milk. And you can see that this is a proportional relationship. To go from number of eggs to cups of milk, we indeed multiplied by two every time. That came straight from this equation."
Math,"And you could also see, look whenever you multiply your number of eggs by a certain amount, you're multiplying your cups of milk by the same amount. If I multiply my eggs by 1,000,000, I'm multiplying my cups of milk by 1,000,000. So this is clearly a proportional relationship. Let's get a little bit more practice identifying the constant of proportionality. So let's say I'll make it a little bit more abstract, let's say I have some variable a and it is equal to five times some variable b."
Math,"What is the constant of proportionality here? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Yes, it is five. Give me a b, I'm gonna multiply it by five, and I can figure out what a needs to be. Let's do another example. If I said that y is equal to pi times x, what is the constant of proportionality here? Well you give me an x, I'm gonna multiply it times a number, the number here is pi, to give you y. So our constant of proportionality here is pi. Let's do one more."
Math,"If I were to say that y is equal to 1/2 times x, what is the constant of proportionality? Pause this video. Think about it. Well once again, this is just going to be the number that we're multiplying by x to figure out y. So it is going to be 1/2. In general, you might sometimes see it written like this. y is equal to k times x, where k would be some constant that would be our constant of proportionality. You see 1/2 is equal to k here, pi is equal to k right over there. So hopefully that helps.."
Math,"But this isn't written in that form, so what we do is manipulate it a little bit so that we can see it in that form. And the obvious thing is we just need to solve for y. So right now it says 4y is equal to 8x. Well, if we wanna solve for y, we can just divide both sides by four, and we are left with y is equal to eight divided by four, which is two times x. Well, now the constant of proportionality jumps out at us. To get y, we have multiply x by two. That is our constant of proportionality."
Math,"Let's do another example. Here we're asked, ""Which equation has a constant ""of proportionality equal to 1/2?"" Again, pause the video. Try to answer it yourself. Okay, so I'm just gonna go equation by equation and calculate their constants of proportionality and see which one has a constant of proportionality equal to 1/2. So this one right over here, choice A clearly has a constant of proportionality of 1/8, so we can just rule that out."
Math,"Equation B right over here clearly has a constant of proportionality of four, not 1/2, so we can rule that one out. Let's see, the constant of proportionality for equation C, if we wanna solve for y, we could divide both sides by six. And so we're gonna get y is equal to 3/6 times x. Well, 3/6 is the same thing as 1/2 times x, and so there you have it. We have a constant of proportionality of 1/2. That's the choice I like. And we can verify that this one doesn't work."
Math,"If you wanna solve for y, you divide both sides by three, and you get y is equal to nine divided by three is 3x, so here our constant of proportionality is three, so we can feel good about choice C.."
Math,"Y is proportional to x. And this constant right over here is our constant of proportionality. So if that's going to be 0.6, so in our tables, or in the table that has a constant of proportionality of 0.6, y should be equal to 0.6 times x for every x,y pair. So let's look at these choices. So is seven 0.6 times four? Well, no, seven is larger than four. 0.6 times four would actually be 2.4, so this one is not gonna be, is definitely not going to have a constant of proportionality of 0.6."
Math,"And in fact, this table, this isn't even a proportional relationship. For this first one, I would have to multiply by 7/4. And then here I'm going to be multiplying by 10/6, which is equivalent to 5/3. And here I'm multiplying by 13/8, so I'm not multiplying by the same constant every time. So this isn't even a proportional relationship. Now let's look at choice B. Well, to go from four to 2.4, that is. You would multiply by 0.6."
Math,"But that's not enough for us to say that this is truly a proportional relationship. It would have to be 0.6 in every scenario. So let's see. Nine times 0.6, yeah, that is 5.4. Nine times six is 54. But now this is nine times 6/10. It's 54 divided by 10, which is 5.4. And now let's see, 14 times six is 84. So 14 times 6/10 would indeed be 8.4. So this looks like our choice. And we can verify that this would not be the case. Let's see, three, to get to two we would be multiplying by 2/3."
Math,"And then here, once again, we're multiplying by 2/3. And then here, once again, we're multiplying by 2/3. So this is actually describing a proportional relationship, but our constant of proportionality here is 2/3, which, if you tried to express it as a decimal, it would be 0.6 repeating. 2/3 is equal to 0.6 repeating. And so it is proportional but does not have this constant of proportionality. So we like our choice B.."
Math,"Find the constant of proportionality, r, in the equation y is equal to r times x. So pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right so we wanna find the constant, the constant of proportionality, I sometimes have trouble saying that, r, where if I for any x, if I multiply it by r I get y. Well we just have to look at each of these x's and figure out well what are we multiplying by to get to y."
Math,"So what do I have to multiply four by to get to 10? Well if you multiply it by 10/4, if you multiply it by 10/4, then you're gonna get to 10. And 10/4 is the same thing as multiplying it by, let's see that is 2 1/2. So this is times 2 1/2. So let's see does that hold? In every case if I multiply by 2 1/2, if I multiply x by 2 1/2, do I get y? So five times 2 1/2, five times two is 10, and then another 1/2 is 2.5. It indeed does equals 12.5. Five times 2.5. And then here 10 times 2.5 is clearly 25."
Math,"And you can work it out by hand. I did the little bit of the multiplication in my head, but you can see in every case, I take my x, I multiply it by 2.5, I get my y. So in every case I take my x and multiply it by the constant of proportionality 2.5, I get my y. So what's the constant of proportionality? It is 2.5.."
Math,"This says D equals 2C tells us that however many cupcakes someone buys, we multiply that times two to get the amount of dollars, the price that they need to pay. So this must mean that each cupcake is two dollars. Or that it's two dollars per cupcake. Because however many cupcakes we get, we multiply that by two dollars per cupcake to get the actual price. So let's see, choice A says the bakery charges two dollars for each cupcake. Yeah, that's pretty close to what I just said. So I'll go with that one."
Math,"The bakery sells two cupcakes for a dollar. No, that would not be the case. And you could even try it out. If we had one cupcake. So if C is one, what is D going to be? And actually, let me just do that for you 'cause it's interesting. C and D. So if you get one cupcake, you're gonna multiply it by two. It's going to be two dollars. Two cupcakes, we're gonna multiply it by two and be four dollars."
Math,"It's consistent with this first choice, but to sell two cupcakes, it's not gonna be four dollars, it's gonna be for four dollars. The bakery sells two types of cupcakes. Well, they don't say anything about that, so I'll rule that out, as well. Let's do another one. Here, we are told, select the store with the least expensive ice cream per scoop. There's definitely a dessert theme going on over here. Alright, so pause this video and see if you can work it out. Is it choice A, choice B or choice C."
Math,"Alright, now let's go through these together. Choice A calculates the total price D in dollars of ice cream with S scoops using the equation D is equal to 0.75S. So whatever the number of scoops are, we're gonna multiply that times 75 cents or 75 hundredth of a dollar to get the price. And so based on the logic we just used in that last example, in store A, it is 75 cents, 75 cents per, per scoop. So we know the price there."
Math,"And anything like this, when you're comparing, you wanna put it all in the same terms. Okay, here it's 75 cents per scoop. Let's think about how many, how much per scoop it is at B. And how many, how much per scoop it is for C. Alright, now store B. So, when I get three scoops, I multiply that times one to get three dollars. When I get eight scoops, I multiply it times one to get eight dollars. When I have 12 scoops, I multiply it by one to get 12 dollars."
Math,"So the equation that store B must use is that the dollar is D. That's going to be equal to one times the number of scoops. Or you could view this as, hey, it's a dollar per scoop at store B. So one dollar, one dollar per scoop. So we already know that store A is cheaper than store B. 'Cause 75 cents per scoop is cheaper than one dollar per scoop. Store C, alright, so here this, this relationship is described with a graph but we can put it in the same forms that we saw before. So for store C."
Math,"Make a little table here. And so if I have the scoops and I have the dollars. So let's see. When I get two scoops, it looks like, and I'm just picking values where it looks like I can read the graph easily. Two scoops looks like three dollars. Two scoops, three dollars. Four scoops, it is six dollars. Four scoops, it's six dollars. So it looks like I'm multiplying times one point half, one and a half, I was gonna say one point half. 1.5 or one and a half to go from scoops to dollars."
Math,"Or another way you can think about it is the dollars is equal to 1.5 times the scoops. Or another way to think about it, at store C, they're charging a 1.50, 1.50 per, per scoop. So store C is the most expensive followed by B and then store A is the cheapest and that's what they're asking us. The least expensive ice cream per scoop is store A.."
Math,"So, car A, they clearly just give its speed, it's 50 kilometers per hour. Now, let's see, car B travels the distance of D kilometers in H hours based on the equation 55h is equal to D. Alright, now, let's see if we can translate this somehow into kilometers per hour. So, 55h is equal to D or we could say D is equal to 55H and here I'm doing, this is this scenario right over here, not scenario A."
Math,"And so, another way  to think about it is distance divided by time, so if we divide both sides by hours, we would have distance divided by time, and so if we have D over H, then we would just be left with 55 on the right hand side. All I did is I divided both sides Now, this is distance divided by time, so the units here are going to be, we're assuming, and it tells us D is in kilometers, H is in hours, so the units here are going to be kilometers per hour."
Math,"So, car B is going 55 kilometers per hour while car A is only going 50 kilometers per hour. So, so far, car B is the fastest. Now, car C travels 135 kilometers in three hours. Well, let's just get the hourly rate or I guess you could say the unit rate."
Math,"So, 135 kilometers in three hours, and so we can get the rate per hour, so 135 divided by three is what? That is going to be, let's do it in our head, I think it's 45 but let me just verify that, three goes into 135, three goes into 13 four times, four times three is 12. You subtract, you get, yep, three goes into 15 five times, five times three is 15. Subtract zero. So, this is equal to 45 kilometers per hour."
Math,"So, car A is 50 kilometers per hour, car B is 55 kilometers per hour, car C is 45 kilometers per hour, so car B is the fastest.."
Math,"All right so we wanna figure out what h gives us a d of one centimeter. Remember d is measured in centimeters. So we really just need to solve the equation one centimeter, when d is equal to one, what is h going to be? And to solve for h we just need to divide both sides by five. So you divide both sides by five, the coefficient on the h, and you are left with h is equal to 1/5. And the unit for h is hours, 1/5 of an hour. So 1/5 of an hour."
Math,"If they had minutes there, then you would say well 1/5 of an hour, there's 60 minutes, well this is 12 minutes. But they just want it as a number of hours, so 1/5 of an hour. How many centimeters of snow accumulates in per hour? Or this is a little bit of a typo. How many centimeters of snow accumulate in we could say one hour, in one hour, or they could have said how many centimeters of snow accumulate per hour. That's another way of thinking about it. So we could get rid of per hour."
Math,"So pause the video and see if you can figure that out. Well there's a couple of ways to think about it. Perhaps the easiest one is to say, well what is d when h is equal to one? And so we could just say d when h is equal to one, when only one hour has elapsed, well it's going to be five times one which is equal to five, and our units for d are in centimeters. So five centimeters. Let's do another example."
Math,"Betty's Bakery calculates the total price d in dollars for c cupcakes using the equation d is equal to two c. What does two mean in this situation? So pause this video and see if you can answer this question. So remember d is in dollars for c cupcakes. Now one way to think about it is, what happens if we take d is equal to two times c, what happens if we divide both sides by c? You have d over c is equal to two."
Math,"And so what would be the units right over here? Well we have dollars, d dollars, over c cupcakes. So this would be $2, because that's the units for d, per cupcake, dollars per cupcake. This is the unit rate per cupcake. How much do you have to pay per cupcake? So which of these choices match up to that? The bakery charges $2 for each cupcake, yeah $2 per cupcake, that looks right. The bakery sells two cupcakes for a dollar. No that would be two cupcakes per dollar, not $2 per cupcake."
Math,"The bakery sells two types of cupcakes. No no we're definitely not talking about two types of cupcakes, they're just talking about cupcakes generally, or I guess one type of cupcake, we don't know, but just cupcakes generally is $2 per cupcake.."
Math,"So let's just say that we want to think about the relationship between x and y. And let's say that when x is one, y is three, and then when x is two, y is six. And when x is nine, y is 27. Now this is a proportional relationship. Why is that? Because the ratio between y and x is always the same thing. And actually the ratio between y and x or, you could say the ratio between x and y, is always the same thing."
Math,"So, for example-- if we say the ratio y over x-- this is always equal to-- it could be three over one, which is just three. It could be six over two, which is also just three. It could be 27 over nine, which is also just three. So you see that y over x is always going to be equal to three, or at least in this table right over here. And so, or at least based on the data points we have just seen. So based on this, it looks like that we have a proportional relationship between y and x."
Math,"So this one right over here is proportional. So given that, what's an example of relationships that are not proportional. Well those are fairly easy to construct. So let's say we had-- I'll do it with two different variables. So let's say we have a and b. And let's say when a is one, b is three. And when a is two, b is six. And when a is 10, b is 35. So here-- you might say look, look when a is one, b is three so the ratio b to a-- you could say b to a-- you could say well when b is three, a is one."
Math,"Or when a is one, b is three. So three to one. And that's also the case when b is six, a is two. Or when a is two, b is six. So it's six to two. So these ratios seem to be the same. They're both three. But then all of sudden the ratio is different right over here. This is not equal to 35 over 10. So this is not a proportional relationship. In order to be proportional the ratio between the two variables always has to be the same. So this right over here-- This is not proportional. Not proportional."
Math,"So the key in identifying a proportional relationship is look at the different values that the variables take on when one variable is one value, and then what is the other variable become? And then take the ratio between them. Here we took the ratio y to x, and you see y to x, or y divided by x-- the ratio of y to x  is always going to be the same here so this is proportional. And you could actually gone the other way."
Math,"You could have said, well what's the ratio of x to y? Well over here it would be one to three, which is the same thing as two to six, which is the same thing as nine to 27. When you take this ratio-- if you say the ratio of x to y instead of y to x, you see that it is always one third. But any way you look at it-- the ratio between these two variables-- if you say y to x, it's always going to be three. Or x to y is always going to be one third. So this is proportional while this one is not.."
Math,"Is the total price you pay proportional to the number of tickets you buy? This is interesting, because they tell us the price of a bucket of popcorn, but then they tell us that we never buy the popcorn. So I guess, I don't know they even told us what the price is; maybe to confuse us."
Math,"Is the total price you pay proportional to the number of tickets you buy? Well, you're only buying tickets; you're not gonna be buying any popcorn, so yeah, you're gonna spend $10.50 for every ticket, so it should be proportional. Just to see that a little bit clearer, let's draw a little table here. So, number of tickets; and then price, the total price. We're assuming I never buy the popcorn. So, if I buy one ticket, the price is going to be 10.50."
Math,"If I buy two tickets, it's gonna be two times 10.50, or $21.00. If I buy three tickets, gonna be three times 10.50, which is what? 31.50. And so, you can see the ratio between price and number of tickets, it's always going to be 10.50. 10.50 divided by one; 21 divided by two; 31.50 divided by three; it's always going to be 10.50. That's 'cause the price, put another way, the price is just going to be 10.50 times the number of tickets. So, clearly a proportional relationship.."
Math,"And what's interesting here, they're not saying, is the number of bananas eaten, they're saying the number of bananas Nate has left, proportional to the number of days that pass. So let's draw a little table here to think about this a little bit more. So I'm gonna make three columns. I'm gonna make three columns. So in the first column, this is gonna be the number of days that pass. So number of days... that pass. So that's this right over here, the number of days that pass."
Math,"And this middle column, I'm gonna write the number of bananas Nate has left. Number of bananas... bananas left. And over here, I'm gonna make the ratio between the two. In order for this to be a proportional relationship, the ratio between these two has to be constant. So bananas left. So I'm gonna divide the second column by the first column. Bananas left... left, divided by days passed. Days passed. All right, so let's think about it a little bit."
Math,"When one day has passed, how many bananas will he have left? Well, in that one day he will have eaten two bananas, so you're going to have 98 bananas left. And so what's the ratio of bananas left to days passed? Well, it's 98 over one, which is going to be equal to 98. All right. When two days have passed, how many bananas is he gonna have left? Well, he's going to consume two more bananas, so he's going to have 96 left, and so what's the ratio? It's going to be 96 to two, which is equal to 48."
Math,"So clearly this ratio is not constant. It changed just from going to one day to the next day. So we don't have a constant ratio of bananas left to days passed, so this is not, this is not a proportional, proportional relationship."
Math,"Now, things might've been a little bit different if they said the number of bananas Nate has eaten, is that proportional to the number of days that passed? Well, yeah, sure, because then, if this was the number of bananas eaten, if this was the number of bananas eaten, then it would always be two times the number of days that pass, so that would be two, and then that would be four, and then these ratios would always be two. But that's not what they asked for."
Math,They wanted us to compare number of bananas left to number of days that pass..
Math,"Or if the ratio of the number of tomatoes to the number of servings is always the same. So let's just think about the ratio of the number of tomatoes to the number of servings. So it's 10 to 6, which is the same thing as 5 to 3. So here the ratio is 5 to 3. 15 to 9, if you divide both of these by 3, you get 5 to 3. So it's the same ratio. 15 to 25, if you divide both of these by 5, you get 5 to 3."
Math,"So based on this data, it looks like the ratio between the number of tomatoes and the number of servings is always constant. So yes, this relationship is proportional.."
Math,"Which of the following could be combinations of volumes of bleach and water for Mael's sanitizing solution? And they gave us, actually they gave us five potential combinations, they say pick three. So I encourage you to pause this video and try to figure it out. Remember, he mixes 15 milliliters of bleach for every 3.75 liters of water. Alright, now let's try to work this together. So I'm gonna make a table here. So let's say this is bleach, bleach in milliliters. And lets say this is water in liters."
Math,"And they tell us that he mixes 15 milliliters, the unit here is milliliters, for every 15 milliliters of bleach for every 3.75 liters of water. So what is the proportionality constant here? If you said the water is equal to some constant times the bleach, well what's going on? Well let's see, what would he have to multiply by? He would have to multiply by 3.75 over 15. Now what is 3.75 divided by 15? Let me actually do it right over here, 15 goes into 3.75."
Math,"Let's see, 15 goes into 37 two times, we have our little decimal right over here, two times 15 is 30, subtract seven, bring down the five and then 15 times five is 75, five times 15 is 75, it all works out. So we see to go from bleach to water we're multiplying by a proportionality constant of 0.25. So we have to see which of these have the same exact proportionality constant going from bleach to water. So let's see, this next one is 12 and three."
Math,"So if we multiply 12 by 0.25, do we get three? Yeah, three is one fourth of 12, 0.25, 25 hundredths is the same thing as one fourth so this one checks out. What about going from six to 1.5? Are we multiplying by 0.25? Yeah, 1.5 is one fourth of six or another way to think about it is what is six times 25? It is a 150 so six times 25 hundredths would be a 150 hundredths which is the same thing as 1.5. So this one works. What about three and 0.75? So three and 0.75."
Math,"Am I multiplying by 0.25? Yeah, if I multiply three times 25 hundredths, I get 75 hundredths so that works. So actually the first three choices are our three answers but let's just verify that the next two are not good answers. So let's see, if I go from 20 to 5.5, and so am I multiplying by 0.25? No, 0.25 which is the same thing as one fourth, one fourth times 20 is five, not 5.5. So that doesn't work."
Math,"And then going from 11 to 3.75, well we definitely know that's not gonna work because notice we have the same amount of water but we have less bleach. Or you could say what's one fourth of 11? Well that's going to be less than 3.75 so we can rule both of these choices out.."
Math,"We also know this is a, these are going to be right angles, that's what makes it a square. Now the question I want to ask, are the lengths of the side of a square proportional to its area? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it, are the lengths of a side, are the lengths of the sides of a square proportional to the square's area? Well to think about that let's draw, let's have a little table here."
Math,"So side length, side length and that's going to be given as x, so that's going to be x, and then I'll have another column, I can draw that a little bit neater so let me use this tool, so there you go, and I'm going to make two columns, two columns right over here, and then over here I'm going to put area. Area, and what's the area going to be? Well the area is going to be one of the sides squared, I suppose you could view it as the width times the height, so its going to be x times x or x squared."
Math,"So let's just pick some values for x and then figure out what the area is going to be. So if x is going to be equal to one, the area's going to be one times one, which is still one. If x is going to be equal to two, the area's going to be two times two, which is equal to four."
Math,"If x is going to be equal to three, the area's going to be three times three, which is equal to nine, and I could keep going but I think this is enough, these are enough points to think about is the side length proportional to the area, or is the area proportional to the side length? Now one of the ways you can think about proportionality is, are the ratios between the side length and the corresponding area always the same, so we want to look at the ratio between side length and area, or area and side length, as long as they're always constant."
Math,"Area and side length, here let me do those as two separate, and side length. So let's make an extra column here. Let's make an extra column here, so there we go, and let's look at that ratio, the ratio of area to side, to side length. So here the ratio's one over one, one over one, which equals one. Now that seems reasonable. For this next one the ratio of area over side length is four over two, four over two, which equals two."
Math,"I don't even have to go to this third one, I can, I can say this ratio is going to be area over side length is going to be equal to three. And notice I get a different value every time. This is not equal to a constant, I don't have a constant ratio between area and side length so that tells us that these two, that the side length and the area are not proportional. Not, not proportional."
Math,"And if you look at it, it makes a lot of sense that the ratio is actually going to be equal to the actual side length, that it changes depending on the side length and that's because we're squaring things, it's literally, you're literally taking x squared, if, you know, you have x here, this is going to be x squared and the ratio is going to be x squared over x, which of course is always just going to be equal, this is x times x divided by x, that's always going to be equal to x, and we see that right over here."
Math,But it's definitely not proportional..
Math,"I'm going to draw a table, so let me make some columns here. So there you have that, we have that, and we'll make three columns and on the first column we're going to think about the Side length. Side length, and that's measured as x. And in the next column I want to think about the Perimeter. Well what is that? That's going to be x plus x plus x plus x which is, of course, four x. And then I want to think about the ratio. The ratio between Perimeter, Perimeter and Side length."
Math,"So let's see, when the Side length is equal to one, what's the Perimeter? It's going to be four times one. One plus one plus one plus one. It's going to be four. And what's our ratio? It's going to be four to one which, of course, is equal to four. Now what if the Side length is two? Well then the Perimeter is going to be two plus two plus two plus two. It's going to be four times two. That's going to be eight. So the ratio's going to be eight to two which is going to be equal to four."
Math,"I think we see a pattern here. The ratio of Perimeter to Side length, it looks like it's always going to be four. Now we could keep going here. If our Side length is three, then our Perimeter is going to be 12. What's the ratio? 12 divided by three is equal to four. Now this isn't some magical thing here, because to figure out the Perimeter we're multiplying it by four."
Math,"So if the ratio of Perimeter to Side length, it's always going to be, the Perimeter is going to be four x if the Side length is x, and four x divided by x, well that's always going to be four. Well this definitely meets our conditions for being a proportional relationship. The ratio between Perimeter and Side length is always going to be four. We didn't have to do this table here, but this makes it a little bit more concrete."
Math,"Or we could write it like this, we could write that Perimeter for a square is equal to four times the Side length. And so, once again, it becomes clear it's a proportional relationship. The Perimeter is equal to a constant times the Side length, or the Perimeter divided by the Side length is equal to four. So this is definitely a proportional relationship between Side length and Perimeter.."
Math,"And just as a reminder, a proportional relationship is one where the ratio between the two variables, and let's say we took the ratio between Y and X, you could also go the other way around, the ratio between X and Y. But the ratio between Y and X is always going to be some number, some constant number. Or you could rewrite it another way, If you were to multiply both sides of this equation times X, you could say in a proportional relationship, Y is always going to be equal to some constant times X."
Math,"So with that out of the way, let's look at these three relationships. So this one over here, let me draw another column here. Another column. This is, let me call this the Y over X column. I'm just gonna keep figuring out what this ratio is for each of these pairs. So for this first pair, when X is one, Y is one half, so this ratio is one half over one. Well one half over one is just the same thing as one half."
Math,"When X is four, Y is two, this ratio is gonna be two over four, which is the same thing as one half. When X is negative two and Y is negative one, this ratio is negative one over negative two, which is the same thing as one half. So for at least these three points that we've sampled from this relationship, it looks like the ratio between Y and X is always one half. In this case K would be one half, we could write Y over X is always equal to one half."
Math,"Or at least for these three points that we've sampled, and we'll say, well, maybe it's always the case, for this relationship between X and Y, or if you wanted to write it another way, you could write that Y is equal to one half X. Now let's graph this thing. Well, when X is one, Y is one half. When X is four, Y is two. When X is negative two, Y is negative one. I didn't put the marker for negative one, it would be right about there."
Math,"And so if we say these three points are sampled on the entire relationship, and the entire relationship is Y is equal to one half X, well the line that represents, or the set of all points that would represent the possible X-Y pairs, it would be a line. It would be a line that goes through the origin. Because look, if X is zero, one half times zero is going to be equal to Y. And so let's think about some of the key characteristics. One, it is a line. This is a line here. It is a linear relationship."
Math,"And it also goes through the origin. And it makes sense that it goes through an origin. Because in a proportional relationship, actually when you look over here, zero over zero, that's indeterminate form, and then that gets a little bit strange, but when you look at this right over here, well if X is zero and you multiply it by some constant, Y is going to need to be zero as well. So for any proportional relationship, if you're including when X equals zero, then Y would need to be equal to zero as well."
Math,"And so if you were to plot its graph, it would be a line that goes through the origin. It would be a line that goes through the origin. And so this is a proportional relationship and its graph is represented by a line that goes through the origin. Now let's look at this one over here, this one in blue. So let's think about whether it is proportional. And we could do the same test, by calculating the ratio between Y and X. Y and X."
Math,"So it's going to be, let's see, for this first one it's going to be three over one, which is just three. Then it's gonna be five over two. Five over two, well five over two is not the same thing as three. So already we know that this is not proportional. Not proportional. We don't even have to look at this third point right over here, where if we took the ratio between Y and X, it's negative one over negative one, which would just be one. Let's see, let's graph this just for fun, to see what it looks like."
Math,"When X is one, Y is three. When X is one, Y is three. When X is two, Y is five. X is two, Y is five. And when X is negative one, Y is negative one. When X is negative one, Y is negative one. And I forgot to put the hash mark right there, it was right around there. And so if we said, okay, let's just give the benefit of the doubt that maybe these are three points from a line, because it looks like I can actually connect them with a line. Then the line would look something like this."
Math,"The line would look something like this. So notice, this is linear. This is a line right over here. But it does not go through the origin. So if you're just looking at a relationship visually, linear is good, but it needs to go through the origin as well for it to be proportional relationship. And you see that right here. This is a linear relationship, or at least these three pairs could be sampled from a linear relationship, but the graph does not go through the origin."
Math,"And we see here, when we look at the ratio, that it was indeed not proportional. So this is not proportional. Now let's look at this one over here. Let's look at what we have here. So I'll look at the ratios. Y over X. So for this first pair, one over one, then we have four over two, well we immediately see that we are not proportional. And then nine over three, it would be three. So clearly this is not a constant number here. We don't always have the same value here, and so this is also not proportional."
Math,"Not proportional. But let's graph it just for fun. When X is one, Y is one. When X is two, Y is four. This actually looks like the graph of Y is equal to X squared. When X is three, Y is nine. At least these three points are consistent with it. So one, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So it's gonna look something... And so, if this really is, if these points are sampled from Y equals X squared, then when X is zero, Y would be zero."
Math,"So this one actually would go through the origin, but notice, it's not a line. It's not a linear relationship. This right over here is the graph of Y equals X squared. So this one also is not proportional. So once again, these three points could be sampled from Y equals one half X, these three points could be sampled from, let's see, Y is equal to, let's see, it looks like a line when... this looks like it could be Y = 2x + 1."
Math,"So it's a linear relationship, but it does not go through the origin, so it's not proportional. And these three points look like they could be sampled from Y equals X squared, which goes through the origin. When X is zero, Y is zero, but it's not a linear relationship. Any way you look at it, if you look at it visually, it has to be a line that goes through the origin, or if you look at a table of values, look at the ratios, and the ratios always have to be the same value."
Math,"And that was only the case with this magenta one, right over here.."
Math,"All right, now let's do this together. And before I even look at the choices, let me analyze this a little bit. It is a proportional relationship. So we know that our total cost, let me write it here. Our total cost is going to be equal to some constant of proportionality times our number of hours. And we can even figure out what that constant of proportionality is going to be, because they give us this point A."
Math,"We know that when our hours are four, so when this is four right over here, our total cost is $120. So what times four is equal to 120? Well, we know that this k must be 30, 'cause 30 times four is 120. So we can write that proportional relationship where our total cost is going to be equal to our constant of proportionality, 30, times our number of hours. Number of hours. So let's see which of these choices, and it might be more than one, say this or describe what's going on here."
Math,"So choice A, the y-coordinate of point A, so point A is at the point four comma 120, so the y-coordinate is the 120. That's the total cost when you run your business for four hours. The y-coordinate of point A represents the total cost of electricity when the business operates for four hours. Yes, that is exactly or very close (laughs) to what I just said, so I like this one. The total cost of electricity is $35 when operating the business for one hour. So let's go to one hour here."
Math,"This is going to be the total cost. Now, you might say, hey, this looks kinda close to $35, but that's why it was useful for us to write this relationship right over here, because what we see is that our total cost is going to be 30 times our number of hours. Our total cost here is actually going to be 30, not 35. And it actually does look smack dab in between 20 and 40 versus a little bit closer to 40. So this one is not going to be true."
Math,"And we're not gonna select none of the above, 'cause we actually did select one of the above. And we're done.."
Math,"And there's a bunch of different ways to solve this. And I'll explore really all of them, or a good selection of them. So one way to think about it is, these two need to be equivalent ratios, or really, equivalent fractions. So whatever happened to the numerator also has to happen to the denominator. So what do we have to multiply 8 by to get 10? Well you could multiply 8 times 10/8. It will definitely give you 10. So we're multiplying by 10/8 over here."
Math,"Or another way to write 10/8, 10/8 is the same thing as 5/4. So we're multiplying by 5/4 to get to 10, from 8 to 10. Well, if we did that to the numerator, in order to have an equivalent fraction, you have to do the same thing to the denominator. You have to multiply it. You have to multiply it times 5/4. And so we could say this n, this thing that we just solved for, this n is going to be equal to 36 times 5 divided by 4. Or you could say that this is going to be equal to 36 times 5 divided by 4."
Math,"And now, 36 divided by 4, we know what that is. We could divide both the numerator and the denominator You divide the numerator by 4, you get 9. Divide the denominator by 4 you get 1. You get 45. So that's one way to think about it. 8/36 is equal to 10/45. Another way to think about it is, what do we have to multiply 8 by to get its denominator. How much larger is the denominator 36 than 8? Well let's just divide 36/8."
Math,"So 36/8 is the same thing as-- so we can simplify, dividing the numerator and the denominator That's the greatest common divisor. That's the same thing as 9/2. So if you multiply the numerator by 9/2, you get the denominator. So we're multiplying by 9/2 to get the denominator over here. Well, then we have to do the same thing over here. If 36 is 9/2 times 8, let me write this. 8 times 9/2 is equal to 36. Right? That's how we go from the numerator to the denominator."
Math,"Then to figure out what the denominator here is, if we want the same fraction, we have to multiply by 9/2 again. So then we'll get 10 times 9/2 is going to be equal to n, is going to be equal to this denominator. And so this is the same thing as saying 10 times 9/2. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 2, you get 5/1, which is 45. So 45 is equal to n. Once again, we got the same way, completely legitimate way, to solve it."
Math,"Now sometimes when you see proportion like this, sometimes people say, oh you can cross-multiply. And you can cross-multiply. And I'll teach you how to do that. And that's sometimes a quick way to do it. But I don't like teaching it the first time you look at proportions, because it's really just something mechanical. You really don't understand what you're doing. And it really comes out of a little bit of algebra. And I'll show you the algebra as well."
Math,"But if you don't understand it, or if it doesn't make as much sense to you at this point, don't worry too much about it. So we have 8/36 is equal to 10/n. When you cross-multiply, you're saying that the numerator here, times the denominator over here, is going to be equal to, so 8 times n, is going to be equal to the denominator over here, let me just different color, the denominator over here, times the numerator over here. This is what it means to cross-multiply."
Math,"So this is going to be equal to 36 times 10. Let me do this in a neutral color now. You could say that 8n is equal to 360. And so you're saying 8 times what is equal to 360. Or to figure out what that times what is, you divide 360 divided by 8. So we could divide, and this is a little bit of algebra here, we're dividing both sides of the equation by 8. And we're getting n is equal to 360 divided by 8. You could do that without thinking in strict algebraic terms. You could say 8 times what is 360."
Math,"Well 8 times 360/8. If I write 8 times question mark is equal to 360, well, question mark could definitely be 360/8. If I multiply these out, this guy and that guy cancel out, and it's definitely 360. And that's why it's 360/8. But now we want to actually divide this to actually get our right answer, or a simplified answer. 8 goes into 360, 8 goes into 36 4 times, 4 times 8 is 32. You have a remainder of 4. Bring down the 0. 8 goes into 40 5 times. 5 times 8 is 40. And then you have no remainder."
Math,"And you're done. Once again, we got n is equal to 45. Now the last thing I'm going to show you involves a little bit of algebra. If any of the ways before this worked, that's fine. And where this is sitting in the playlist, you're not expected to know the algebra. But I want to show you the algebra just because I wanted to show you that this cross-multiplication isn't some magic, that using algebra, we will get this exact same thing. But you could stop watching this, if you'll find this part confusing."
Math,"So let's rewrite our proportion, 8/36 is equal to 10/n. And we want to solve for n. Well the easiest way to solve for n is maybe multiply both-- this thing on the left is equal to this thing on the right. So we can multiply them both by the same thing. And the equality will still hold. So we could multiply both of them by n. On the right-hand side, the n's cancel out. On the left-hand side, we have 8/36 times n is equal to 10. Now if we want to solve for n, we could literally multiply."
Math,"If we want just an n here, we would want to multiply this side times 36-- I'll do that in a different color-- we'd want to multiply this side times 36 times 8, because if you multiply these guys out, you get 1. And you just have an n. But since we're doing it to the left-hand side, we also have to do it to the right-hand side, so times 36/8. These guys cancel out and we're left with n is equal to 10 times 36 is 360/8. And notice, we're getting the exact same value that we got with cross-multiplying."
Math,"And with cross-multiplying, you're actually doing two steps. Actually, you're doing an extra step here. You're multiplying both sides by n, so that you had your 8n. And then you're multiplying both sides by 36, so that you get your 36 on both sides. And you get this value here. But at the end, when you simplify it, you'll get the exact same answer. So those are all different ways to solve this proportion."
Math,"Probably the most obvious way, or the easiest way to do it in your head, was either just looking at what you have to multiply the numerator by and then doing the same thing to the denominator, or maybe by cross-multiplication.."
Math,"So in this first problem, we have 9 markers cost $11.50. And then they ask us, how much would 7 markers cost? And let's just set x to be equal to our answer. So x is equal to the cost of 7 markers. So the way to solve a problem like this is to set up two ratios and then set them equal to each other."
Math,"So you could say that the ratio of 9 markers to the cost of 9 markers, so the ratio of the number of markers, so 9, to the cost of the 9 markers, to 11.50, this should be equal to the ratio of our new number of markers, 7, to whatever the cost of the 7 markers are, Let me do x in green. So this is a completely valid proportion here. The ratio of 9 markers to the cost of 9 markers is equal to 7 markers to the cost of 7 markers. And then you could solve this to figure out how much those 7 markers would cost."
Math,"And you could flip both sides of this, and it would still be a completely valid ratio. You could have 11.50 to 9. The ratio between the cost of the markers to the number of markers you're buying, 11.50 to 9, is equal to the ratio of the cost of 7 markers to the number of markers, which is obviously 7. So all I would do is flip both sides of this equation right here to get this one over here. You could also think about the ratios in other ways."
Math,"You could say that the ratio of 9 markers to 7 markers is going to be the same as the ratio of their costs, is going to be equal to the ratio of the cost of 9 markers to the cost of 7 markers. And then, obviously, you could flip both of these sides. Let me do that in the same magenta color. The ratio of 7 markers to 9 markers is the same thing as the ratio of the cost of 7 markers to the cost of 9 markers. So that is 11.50."
Math,"So all of these would be valid proportions, valid equations that describe what's going on here. And then you would just have to essentially solve for x. So let's do this one right over here. 7 apples cost $5. How many apples can I buy it with $8? So one again, we're going to assume that what they're asking is how many apples-- let's call that x. x is what we want to solve for. So 7 apples costs $5."
Math,"So we have the ratio between the number of apples, 7, and the cost of the apples, 5, is going to be equal to the ratio between another number of apples, which is now x, and the cost of that other number of apples. And it's going to be $8. And so notice here in this first situation, what was unknown was the cost. So we kind of had the number of apples to cost, the number of apples to cost. Now in this example, the unknown is the number of apples, so number of apples to cost, number of apples to cost."
Math,"And we could do all of the different scenarios like this. You could also say the ratio between 7 apples and x apples is going to be the same as the ratio between the cost of 7 apples and the cost of 8 apples. Obviously, you can flip both sides of these in either of these equations to get two more equations. And any of these would be valid equations. Now let's do this last one. I'll use new colors here. A cake recipe for 5 people requires 2 eggs. So we want to know how many eggs-- so this we'll call x."
Math,"And you don't always have to call it x. You could call it e for eggs. Well, e isn't a good idea, because e represents another number once you get to higher mathematics. But you could call them y or z or any variable-- a, b, or c, anything. How many eggs do we need for a 15-person cake? So you could say the ratio of people to eggs is constant. So if we have 5 people for 2 eggs, then for 15 people, we are going to need x eggs. This ratio is going to be constant. 5/2 is equal to 15/x."
Math,"Or you could flip both sides of this. Or you could say the ratio between 5 and 15 is going to be equal to the ratio between the number of eggs for 5 people-- let me do that in that blue color-- and the number of eggs for 15 people. And obviously, you could flip both sides of this equation. So all of these, we've essentially set up the proportions that describe each of these problems. And then you can go later and solve for x to actually get the answer.."
Math,"So 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of oatmeal. And so they're saying, how much flour is needed for a big batch of cookies that uses 9 cups of oatmeal? Now we're going to go to a situation where we are using 9 cups of oatmeal. Let me write it this way-- 9 cups of oatmeal. And I'll show you a couple of different ways to think about it. And whatever works for you, that works. So one way to think about it, so we're wondering."
Math,"We're going to say, look, we know if we have 3 cups of oatmeal, we should use 2 cups of flour. But what we don't know is if we have 9 cups of oatmeal, how many cups of flour do we use? That's what they're asking us. But if we're going from 3 cups of oatmeal to 9 cups of oatmeal, how much more oatmeal are we using? Well, we're using three times more oatmeal, Right? We're multiplying by 3. 3 cups of oatmeal and 9 cups of oatmeal, we're using 3 times the oatmeal."
Math,"Well, if we want to use flour in the same proportion, we have to use 3 times the flour. So then we're also going to multiply the flour times 3. We're going to multiply the flour times 3, so we're going to have to use 6 cups of flour. Ignore that question mark. And that answers the question. That's how much flour we need for a big batch of cookies that uses 9 cups of oatmeal. The other thing is you could set up a proportion. You could say 2 cups of flour over 3 cups of oatmeal is equal to question mark."
Math,"And instead of writing question mark, I'll put a variable in there. Actually, let me put a question mark there just so you really understand it is equal to a question mark in a box number cups of flour over 9 cups of oatmeal. And so I like this first way we did it because it's really just common sense. If we're tripling the oatmeal, then we're going to have to triple the flour to make the recipe in the same proportion."
Math,"Another way, once you set up an equation like this, is actually to do a little bit of algebra. Some people might call it cross-multiplying, but that cross-multiplying is still using a little bit of algebra. And I'll show you why they're really the same thing. In cross-multiplication, whenever you have a proportion set up like this, people will multiply the diagonals."
Math,"So when you use cross-multiplication, you'll say that 2 times 9 must be equal to question mark times 3, must be equal to whatever is in this question mark, the number of cups of flour times 3. Or we get 18 is equal to whatever our question mark was times 3. So the number of cups of flour we need to use times 3 needs to be equal to 18. What times 3 is equal 18? You might be able to do that in your head. That is 6. Or you could divide both sides by 3, and you will get 6."
Math,"So we get question mark in a box needs to be equal to 6 cups of flour. Same answer we got through kind of common sense. Now, you might be wondering, hey, this cross-multiplying doesn't make any intuitive sense. Why does that work? If I have something set up like this proportion set up, why does it work that if I take the denominator here and multiply it by the numerator there that that needs to be equal to the numerator here times the denominator there? And that comes from straight up algebra."
Math,"And to do that, I'm just going to rewrite this part as x just to simplify the writing a little bit. So we have 2/3 is equal to-- instead of that question mark, I'll write x over 9. And in algebra, all you're saying is that this quantity over here is equal to this quantity over here. So if you do anything to what's on the left, if you want it to still be equal, if the thing on the right still needs to be equal, you have to do the same thing to it."
Math,"Now, what we want to do is we want to simplify this so all we have on the right-hand side is an x. So what can we multiply this by so that we're just left with an x? So that we've solved for x? Well, if we multiply this times 9, the 9's are going to cancel out. So let's multiply the right by 9. But of course, if we multiply the right by 9, we have to still multiply the left by 9. Otherwise they still wouldn't be equal."
Math,"If they were equal before being multiplied by 9, for them to still be equal, you have to multiply 9 times both sides. On the right-hand side, the 9's cancel out, so you're just left with an x. On the left-hand side, you have 9 times 2/3, or 9/1 times 2/3. Or this is equal to 18/3. And we know that 18/3 is the same thing as 6. So these are all legitimate ways to do it. I wanted you to understand that what I'm doing right here is algebra. That's actually the reasoning why cross-multiplication works."
Math,"But for a really simple problem like this, you could really just use common sense. If you're increasing the cups of oatmeal by a factor of 3, then increase the cups of flour by a factor of 3.."
Math,"A big clue is the same pace. That means that the hot dogs, hot dogs per minute, per minute, is going to be constant, is always going to be the same, always the same. Always the same, because this is essentially the pace. Her hot dogs per minute are going to stay the same. She's gonna stay at the same pace. So, we it tells us that she can eat 21 hot dogs in 66 minutes. So, her hot dogs per minute, at least up here, is 21 hot dogs in 66 minutes, So, it's 21 hot dogs in 66 minutes."
Math,"Well, if her pace is always going to be the same, well it's gonna take her this ratio over here, is going to be the ratio between 35 hot dogs and however long it takes her to eat 35 hot dogs. So, once again hot dogs per minute are going, has to be a constant because it's gonna be the same pace. Hot dogs per minute. If it takes, 21 hot dogs takes 66 minutes, 35 hot dogs take m minutes, these two ratios are going to be the same. We're dealing with a proportional relationship."
Math,"It's going to be happening at the same rate. And then, we're left with a situation where we just have to solve for m, and there is a bunch of different ways you could tackle this. The easiest way, that I can think of doing it is, I like, I don't like this m sitting here in the denominator, so let's multiply both sides by m. Let me do that in a different color. So, if I multiply that side by m and then this side by m, and so what do we get? On the left hand side, we have 21 over 66m."
Math,"21 over 66 times m, times m, is equal to, is equal to, well, you divide by m and multiply by m. Those are gonna cancel out and you're just gonna have 35. And now, you just have to solve for m and the best way I can think of doing that, is multiply both sides times the reciprocal on, both sides times the reciprocal of the coefficient on the m. So, let's multiply both sides by, let's multiply both side by 66 over 21."
Math,"Once again, I've just swapped the numerator and the denominator here to get the reciprocal, but I can't just do it to one side of the equation, I have to do it to both sides, otherwise, it's not going to be an equa, it's not gonna be equal anymore. So, times 66 over 21, this is just going to be one. You multiply something times it's reciprocal, you're just going to end up with one. So, you're gonna be left with, m is equal to. Now, 35 times 66 divided by 21."
Math,"Well, 35 is the same thing as, 35 is five times seven and 21 is three times seven. So, you're multiplying by seven up here and here, you have a seven in the denominator, you're dividing by seven, so they're going to cancel out. So, this is going to simplify to five times 66 over 3, and then we could simplify it even more, because 66 is the same thing as three times 22. Three times 22 and so, you have a three in the numerator, you're multiplying by three and three in the denominator, dividing by three."
Math,"Three divided by three is one, so you're left with five times 22, which is 110. So, it would take her m minutes to eat 35 hot dogs at the same pace. Now, when some of you might have tackled it, you might have had a different equation set up here. Instead of thinking of hot dogs per minute, you might have thought about minutes per hot dog."
Math,"And so, in that situation, if you thought in terms of minutes per hot dog, you might have said, ok look, it took Mika 66 minutes to eat 20, to eat 21 hot dogs,and it's gonna take her m minutes to eat 35 hot dogs and if it's the same pace, then these two rates are going to be equal. They have to be the same pace. And so, then you can solve for m and actually, this one's easier to solve for m, you just multiply both sides by 35."
Math,"Multiply both sides by 35 and you're left with, on the right hand side you're left with just an m, and on the left hand side, same, same idea. You're taking 35, you have 35 times 66/21, which we already figured out is 110. So, 110 is equal, is equal to m. So, once again, multiple ways to tackle it, but it's important that we got the same answer.."
Math,"And remember, in order for it to be a proportional relationship, the ratio between the two variables is always constant. So, for example, if I look at y over x here, we see that y over x, here it's four over one, which is just four. Eight over two is just four. Eight halves is the same thing as four. 12 over three it's the same thing as four. Y over x is always equal to four. In fact, I can make another column here."
Math,"I can make another column here where I have y over x, here it's four over one, which is equal to four. Here it's eight over two, which is equal to four. Here it's 12 over three, which is equal to four. And so, you can actually use this information, the ratio, the ratio between y and x is this constant four, to express the relationship between y and x as an equation."
Math,"In fact, in some ways this is, or in a lot of ways, this is already an equation, but I can make it a little bit clearer, if I multiply both sides by x. If I multiply both sides by x, if I multiply both sides by x, I am left with, well, x divided by x, you'd just have y on the left hand side. Y is equal to 4x and you see that's the case. X is one, four times that is four. X is two, four times that is eight. So, here you go, we're multiplying by four. We are multiplying by four, we are multiplying by four."
Math,"And so, four, in this case, four, in this case, in this situation, this is our constant of proportionality. Constant, constant, sometimes people will say proportionality constant. Constant of proportionality, portionality. Now sometimes, it might even be described as a rate of change and you're like well, Sal, how is this a, how would four be a rate of change? And, to make that a little bit clearer, let me actually do another example, but this time, I'll actually put some units there."
Math,"So let's say that, let's say that I have, let's say that x-- Let me do this, I already used yellow, let me use blue. So let's x, let's say that's a measure of time and y is a measure of distance. Or, let me put it this way, x is time in terms of seconds. Let me write it this way. So, x, x is going to be in seconds and then, y is going to be in meters. So, this is meters, the units, and this right over here is seconds. So, after one second, we have traveled, oh, I don't know, seven meters."
Math,"After two seconds, we've traveled 14 meters. After three seconds, we've traveled 21 meters, and you can verify that this is a proportional relationship. The ratio between y and x is always seven. Seven over one, 14 over two, 21 over three. But, I wanna write that in terms of it's units. So, y over x is going to be, if we look at this point right over here, it's seven meters over one second. Seven meters over one second, or it's equal to seven meters per second."
Math,"If you look at it right over here, if you say y over x, it's 14 meters, 14 meters, in two seconds, in two seconds. Well, 14 over two is seven, 14 over two is seven, and then the units are meters per second. So, that's why this constant, this seven, in all of these cases we have y over x is equal to seven, that this is also sometimes considered a rate. And over here it's very clear, this is my distance per time."
Math,"Now, if I wanted to write it generally, I could say that, look, if I'm dealing with a proportional relationship, it's going to be of the form, I can always construct and equation of the form, of the form, either y over x is equal to k, where k is some constant. In this first example, k was equal to four and in this second example, k is equal to seven."
Math,"Or, you can just manipulate it algebraically, multiply both sides by x and you would have y is equal to, y is equal to kx, where once again k is our constant of proportionality or proportionality constant. So, this is a really, in some ways it's a very simple idea, but in a lot of ways, you'll see this showing up multiple, many, many times in your mathematical career and it's neat to be able to recognize this as a proportional relationship.."
Math,"So that's x, and the price of the cone, represented by y. I'll do y in purple. Write the equation that describes this relationship. So let's see. When x is 0, y is 0. When x is 1, y is 1 and 3/4. So let me write this as an improper fraction, just so I can visualize it better. So this is 4/4 plus 3/4, which is equal to 7/4. When x is 2, y is 3 and 1/2. So let me see if I can write this in a little bit of a clearer way. So 2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7, so this is 7/2-- which is the same thing as 14 over 4."
Math,"And then here we have, when x is 3, y is equal to-- so 5 and 1/4-- if I would write it as an improper fraction-- 4 times 5 is 20, plus 1 is 21. So this is equal to 21 over 4. And then finally, if we were to write this as something over 4, this is equal to 28 over 4. 7 is the same thing as 28 over 4. So you see that this is a proportional relationship. The ratio between y and x. So let me write this. The ratio between y and x is always equal to 7/4. Notice here, y is 7/4 of x. 7/4-- it's a bigger number."
Math,"Or you could say 1 and 3/4 of x. So let me make that clear. So y over x is equal to 7/4. Or, we can say that y is always 7/4 of x. We can multiply both sides by x, if we like. So if we multiply both sides by x, we get y is equal to 7/4 times x. And you see it here. When x is 4, 7/4 times 4 is 7. When x is 0, y is 0. When x is 3, 7/4 times 3 is 21 over 4, which is the same thing as 5 and 1/4. So there we go. And let me input it, just to make sure we can input it right. So y is equal to 7/4 x."
Math,We would just write y is equal to 7/4 times x. And let's check our answer. And we got it right..
Math,"All right, now there's several ways to approach this question. One way is to say, look, he's running at a constant rate, so his distance is going to be equal to some constant, let's just call that lowercase k, times the amount of time he spends running, and the way that we can figure out what k is is by using the information that they gave us."
Math,"They tell us right over here that when our distance is 17 kilometers, so when our distance is 17 kilometers, that's a situation where he has been running for two hours. So, that is going to be equal to k times two hours. So, what is k going to be? Pause the video again and see if you can figure it out, if you didn't figure it out the first time I asked you to pause the video. All right, well there's a bunch of ways to solve for k, but one way is to say, let's just divide both sides by two hours."
Math,"So, if you divide both sides by two hours, you are going to get that k is going to be equal 17 over two kilometers per hour, which is, 17 over two is 8.5, 8.5 kilometers per hour. And so, if we go back to the original question, which asks us to write an equation that shows the relationship between d and h, we can say that d is equal to, we now know our proportionality constant, it is 8.5 times h. 8.5 times h, and we're done."
Math,"If we wanted to write their units, we could write d is equal to 8.5 kilometers per hour times h, which is given in hours.."
Math,We want to take how many bottles it takes to clean a certain number of bathrooms one third of a bottle take can clean three-fifths of a bathroom and makes it clear that we need to take the one-third and Divide it by three-fifths because then we're going to get bottles per bathroom.
Math,"We're going to get the rate We're not going to get bathrooms per bottle, we're going to get bottles per bathroom Which is what we care about what fraction of the bottle will It will it take to clean entire bathroom to clean one entire bathroom? So now we just have to take one-third and divide it by three-fifths So this is going to be equal to this is going to be equal to you can write it this way one third divided by three-fifths Divided by three fifths and the units are going to be bottles per bathroom."
Math,I'll write it like that Bottles or since if we know that that's going to be a fraction.
Math,"We could just say bottle per bathroom bottle Bathroom and so this is going to be the same thing as well we're going to have one third divided by three fifths is the same thing as One third times the reciprocal of three fifths, so one-third times five thirds one third times five thirds Bottle per bathroom, so let me write that down bottle per bathroom Bottle per bathroom and what is this going to be? Well, We multiply the numerators 1 times 5 is going to give us 5 and the denominator three times three is ninths There's going to be five ninths of a bottle of a bottle per bathroom Bathroom I wrote these a little bit further apart than I would want to let me write that a little bit closer together five ninths of a bottle per bathroom So just as a reminder of what we did here It could see him a little bit daunting But we said okay look we want how much, what fraction of the bottle to clean his entire bathroom So we care about bottles per bathroom or since we're talking about a fraction I guess we could just say bottle some fraction of a bottle per bathroom so it's bottle divided by Bathrooms that's going to give us the correct rate So it took one third of a bottle to clean Three-fifths of a bathroom so you divide one third by three-fifths You get five ninths of a bottle per bathroom, so this question mark right over here that is five ninths, it takes five ninths of a bottle of cleaning solution to clean his entire bathroom."
Math,"You're going to find it pretty straightforward to do. But we're really going to think through it and get the intuition for why this makes sense. So if we were to write this down, the 2, that literally just represents two 1's, I'll just write it down like that. Then we have the 7 in another color. We have a 7 one place to the right of the decimal. It's in the tenths place, with a T-H-S at the end. So it literally represents 7 over 10."
Math,"And then finally, we have the 5 in the hundredths place, so it represents 5 over 100. Now, if I want to write this as a simplified fraction, or really as a mixed number, I have to merge these fraction parts right here. And to add two fractions, you have to have a common denominator. And to figure out the common denominator, you just have to think about the least common multiple of 10 and 100. And that's 100. 100 is divisible by both 100 and 10. So let's get this 10 to be 100."
Math,"So we can do that by multiplying it by 10. So when you multiply something by 10, you add a zero at the end of it. But you can't just do that to the denominator. We also have to do that to the numerator. So we multiplied the denominator by 10. Let's also multiply the numerator by 10. 7 times 10 is 70, or 70 over 100. It's the exact same thing as 7/10. Now we can add these two. What is 70 plus 5? 70 plus 5 is 75. And our denominator is 100, so this can be rewritten as 2 and 75/100."
Math,"And we saw that in the last video, you would read this as two and seventy-five hundredths. Now we aren't in a completely simplified fraction yet because 75 and 100 have common factors. And the largest number that goes into both, if you're familiar with quarters, is 25. Three quarters is $0.75, four quarters is 100 cents, or four quarters is $1.00. So you divide both of them by 25. So 75 divided by 25 is 3, and 100 divided by 25 is 4. So as a simplified mixed number, this becomes 2 and 3/4."
Math,"And after you do a lot of practice here, and you just see a lot of numbers like this, it will be almost second nature for you to say, oh, 2.75 is the same thing as 2 and 75/100, is the same thing as 2 and 3/4.."
Math,"So let's actually divide 8 into 7. And I'll do it down here just so I have some more real estate to work with. I'm going to divide 8 into 7. And I'm going to add a decimal point here, just because we know that this value is going to be less than 1. 7/8 is less than 1. We're going to have some digits to the right of the decimal point. And let me put the decimal point right up here, right above the decimal point in 7. And then we start dividing. And now this really turns into a long division problem."
Math,"And we just have to make sure we keep track of the decimal sign. So 8 goes into-- it doesn't go into 7 at all, but it does go into 70. So 8 goes into 70 eight times. So it goes into 70 eight times. 8 times 8 is 64. And then you subtract. 70 minus 64 is 6. And then bring down another 0 because we still have a remainder. We want to get to the point that we have no remainders. Assuming that this thing doesn't repeat forever. And there's other ways we can deal with that. 8 goes into 60? Well, let's see."
Math,"It doesn't go into it eight times because that's 64. 8 goes into 60 seven times. 7 times 8 is 56. And then we subtract again. 60 minus 56 is 4. And now, we can bring down another 0 right over here. And 8 goes into 40? Well, it goes into 40 exactly five times. 5 times 8 is 40. And we have nothing. We have nothing left over. And so we're done. 7 divided by 8 or 7/8 is equal to 7 divided by 8, which is equal to 0.875. But I'll put a leading 0 here just so it makes it clear that this is where the decimal is."
Math,0.875. And we are done..
Math,"So we can literally divide 25 into 11, and whatever we get, that is going to be the decimal representation of 11/25. And since we're going to go into the places less than the ones place, we're going to go into the tenths place, the hundredths place, and the thousandths place, let's add some zeroes to this 11 right over here after the decimal, and now let's start to divide. 25 doesn't go into 1. 25 doesn't go into 11. 25 does go into 110. So 25 goes into 110 four times. 4 times 25 is 100."
Math,"So it goes into it four times. Let's keep the decimal up here. So we'll write 0.4. 4 times 25 is 100. And now we can subtract 110 minus 100 is 10. And now we can bring down another 0. 25 goes into 100 exactly four times. 4 times 25 is 100, and then you subtract, and you get 0. So we actually didn't even have to round this one. This fraction is exactly 0.44.."
Math,"So we can literally just divide 21 into 16. And because 21 is larger than 16, we're going to get something less than 1. So let's just literally divide 21 into 16. And we're going to have something less than 1. So let's add some decimal places here. We're going to round to the nearest thousandths in case our digits keep going on, and on, and on. And let's start dividing. 21 goes into 1 zero times. 21 goes into 16 zero times. 21 goes into 160-- well, 20 would go into 160 eight times. So let's try 7."
Math,"Let's see if 7 is the right thing. So 7 times 1 is 7. 7 times 2 is 14. And then when we subtract it, we should get a remainder less than 21. If we pick the largest number here where, if I multiply it by 21, I get close to 160 without going over. And so if we subtract, we do get 13. So that worked. 13 is less than 21. And you could just subtract it. I did it in my head right there. But you could regroup. You could say this is a 10. And then this would be a 5. 10 minus 7 is 3. 5 minus 4 is 1. 1 minus 1 is 0."
Math,"Now let's bring down a 0. 21 goes into 130. So let's see. Would 6 work? It looks like 6 would work. 6 times 21 is 126. So that looks like it works. So let's put a 6 there. 6 times 1 is 6. 6 times 2 is 120. There's a little bit of an art to this. All right, now let's subtract. And once again, we can regroup. This would be a 10. We've taken 10 from essentially this 30. So now this becomes a 2. 10 minus 6 is 4. 2 minus 2 is 0. 1 minus 1 is 0. Now let's bring down another 0."
Math,"21 goes into 40, well, almost two times, but not quite, so only one time. 1 times 21 is 21. And now let's subtract. This is a 10. This becomes a 3. 10 minus 1 is 9. 3 minus 2 is 1. And we're going have to get this digit. Because we want to round to the nearest thousandth. So if this is 5 or over, we're going round up. If this is less than 5, we're going to round down. So let's bring another 0 down here. And 21 goes into 190. Let's see, I think 9 will work. Let's try 9. 9 times 1 is 9. 9 times 2 is 18."
Math,"When you subtract, 190 minus 189 is 1. And we could keep going on, and on, and on. But we already have enough digits to round to the nearest thousandth. This digit right over here is greater than or equal to 5. So we will round up in the thousandths place. So if we round to the nearest thousandths, we can say that this is 0.76. And then this is where we're going around up-- 762.."
Math,"So the easiest way to visualize this might just be to make a number line that's long enough that it actually can contain all of these numbers, and then we can think about how we can compare them. So let me just draw a huge number line over here. So, take up almost all the entire screen. I'll stick with, we have some negative numbers here, we go as low as negative five point five, and we have some positive numbers here, looks like we go as high as three point three."
Math,"This thing is still a little less than two, so we go about as high as three point three, so I can put, I can safely I think put zero right here in the middle, I can go a little bit to the right since we have our negative numbers go more negative. So zero, and let's make this negative one, negative two, negative three, negative four, negative five, and well that should be enough. Negative five, and then in the positive direction we have, one, two, three, in the positive direction."
Math,"And let's see if we can plot these. So, to start off, to start off let's look at 1/2. Where does 1/2 sit, so it sits, let me actually make the scale a little bit better. So this is one, two and three, and four. Alright, so let's start with 1/2. 1/2 is directly in-between zero and one, it is half of a whole. This right here would be one whole. This would be one whole, let me label that. This over here is one. So 1/2 is directly between zero and one. So 1/2 is gonna sit right over here."
Math,"So that is, let me write that a little bit bigger, you probably have trouble reading that, Alright, one over two, which is also zero point five. So this is also zero point five, anyway that's where it sits. Then we have negative five. Negative five, well this is negative one, negative two, negative three, negative four, negative five. Negative five sits right over there. And then we have three point three. Positive three point three, I'll do that in blue. Positive three point three."
Math,"So this is one, two, three, and then we want to do another point three. So point three is about a third of the way, a little less than a third of the way, it would be three point three three three forever, if it was a third of the way. So a third of the way, that looks like about right over here. This is three, this right over here would be three point three, let me label."
Math,"What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna label the numbers on the number line up here so it's one, two, three, four, this is zero, negative one, negative two, negative three, negative four, negative five, and so on and so forth. And then we get to zero, which is one of the numbers that we've already written down. Zero is obviously right over there on the number line, so I'll just write this zero in orange to make it clear, it's this zero."
Math,"Then we have 21 over 12, which is an improper fraction, and to think about where we should place that on the number line, to think about where to place it on the number line, let me do this in this blue color. To think about where to place this on the number line let's change it into a mixed number, makes it a little bit easier to visualize, at least for my brain. So 12 goes into 21, well it goes into it one time. One times 12 is 12."
Math,"If you subtract you get a remainder of, well we could actually regroup here, or borrow, if you don't want to do this in your head, you would get nine, but let's do this. So if we borrow one from the two, the two becomes a one, this becomes 11, or we're really regrouping a 10. Anyway, 11 minus two is nine, one minus one is zero. So we have a remainder of nine. So this thing, written as a mixed number, 21 over 12 written as a mixed number is one and 9/12ths."
Math,"You get one 12/12ths in there and then you get 9/12ths left over. So one and 9/12ths we can also write that, actually we could've simplified this right from the get go, cause both 21 and 12 are divisible by three, but now we can just divide nine, we can simplify 9/12ths, divide both the numerator and the denominator by three, we then get one and three over four, one and 3/4ths."
Math,"And just to make it clear, I could have simplified this right from the get go, 21 divided by three, is equal to seven, and 12 divided by three, is equal to four. So this is the same thing as 7/4ths, and if you were to divide four into seven, four goes into seven one time, subtract, one times four is four, subtract to get a remainder of three, one and 3/4ths. So going back to where do we plot this? Well it is, it's one, and then we have 3/4ths, we're going to go three fourths of the way."
Math,"This is half way, this is one fourths, two fourths, three fourths, would be right over there. So this is our 21 over 12, which is the same thing as 7/4ths, which is the same thing as one and 3/4ths. And then we have negative five point five. Negative five point five, I'll do that in magenta again, running out of colors. Negative five point five, well this is negative five, so negative five point five is going to be between negative five and negative six."
Math,"So let me add negative six to our number line, right here just to make it clear. So let me go a little bit further, let's say that this is negative six. Negative six, and our number line will keep going to smaller values. Let me scroll to the left a little bit. Negative six, so if we go to negative five point five, it's smack dab in-between negative five and negative six. So this is negative five point five, right over there. And then finally we have two and 1/8ths."
Math,"I'll do that in orange again, or I'll do it in blue. Two and 1/8ths, so it's two and then 1/8th. And so if we want to find the exact place we could divide this into eighths, this would be 4/8ths, this would be 2/8ths, and that would be 6/8ths, and then 1/8th would sit right over here. So that right over there is two and 1/8th. So we've actually plotted, as best as we could, the exact locations."
Math,"You didn't have to plot the exact locations if you were just trying to order them, but it doesn't hurt to see exactly where they sit when we order them. So now we've essentially ordered them cause we stuck them all on this number line. The order is negative five point five is the smallest, then negative five, then a zero, and then positive 1/2, then 21 over 12, then two and 1/8th, and then three point three. And we're done.."
Math,"But first, I want to answer this question. And then we can think about what the percent, the amount, and the base is, because those are just words. Those are just definitions. The important thing is to be able to solve a problem like this. So they're saying 150 is 25% of what number? Or another way to view this, 150 is 25% of some number. So let's let x, x is equal to the number that 150 is 25% of, right? That's what we need to figure out."
Math,"150 is 25% of what number? That number right here we're seeing is x. So that tells us that if we start with x, and if we were to take 25% of x, you could imagine, that's the same thing as multiplying it by 25%, which is the same thing as multiplying it, if you view it as a decimal, times 0.25 times x. These two statements are identical. So if you start with that number, you take 25% of it, or you multiply it by 0.25, that is going to be equal to 150. 150 is 25% of this number. And then you can solve for x."
Math,"So let's just start with this one over here. Let me just write it separately, so you understand what I'm doing. 0.25 times some number is equal to 150. Now there's two ways we can do this. We can divide both sides of this equation by 0.25, or if you recognize that four quarters make a dollar, you could say, let's multiply both sides of this equation by 4. You could do either one. I'll do the first, because that's how we normally do algebra problems like this. So let's just multiply both by 0.25."
Math,"That will just be an x. And then the right-hand side will be 150 divided by 0.25. And the reason why I wanted to is really it's just good practice dividing by a decimal. So let's do that. So we want to figure out what 150 divided by 0.25 is. And we've done this before. When you divide by a decimal, what you can do is you can make the number that you're dividing into the other number, you can turn this into a whole number by essentially shifting the decimal two to the right."
Math,"But if you do that for the number in the denominator, you also have to do that to the numerator. So right now you can view this as 150.00. If you multiply 0.25 times 100, you're shifting the decimal two to the right. Then you'd also have to do that with 150, so then it becomes 15,000. Shift it two to the right. So our decimal place becomes like this. So 150 divided by 0.25 is the same thing as 15,000 divided by 25. And let's just work it out really fast."
Math,"So 25 doesn't go into 1, doesn't go into 15, it goes into 150, what is that? Six times, right? If it goes into 100 four times, then it goes into 150 six times. 6 times 0.25 is-- or actually, this is now a 25. We've shifted the decimal. This decimal is sitting right over there. So 6 times 25 is 150. You subtract. You get no remainder. Bring down this 0 right here. 25 goes into 0 zero times. 0 times 25 is 0. Subtract. No remainder. Bring down this last 0. 25 goes into 0 zero times. 0 times 25 is 0. Subtract."
Math,"No remainder. So 150 divided by 0.25 is equal to 600. And you might have been able to do that in your head, because when we were at this point in our equation, 0.25x is equal to 150, you could have just multiplied both sides of this equation times 4. 4 times 0.25 is the same thing as 4 times 1/4, which is a whole. And 4 times 150 is 600. So you would have gotten it either way. And this makes total sense. If 150 is 25% of some number, that means 150 should be 1/4 of that number."
Math,"It should be a lot smaller than that number, and it is. 150 is 1/4 of 600. Now let's answer their actual question. Identify the percent. Well, that looks like 25%, that's the percent. The amount and the base in this problem. And based on how they're wording it, I assume amount means when you take the 25% of the base, so they're saying that the amount-- as my best sense of it-- is that the amount is equal to the percent times the base. Let me do the base in green."
Math,"So the base is the number you're taking the percent of. The amount is the quantity that that percentage represents. So here we already saw the percent is 25%. That's the percent. The number that we're taking 25% of, or the base, is x. The value of it is 600. We figured it out. And the amount is 150. This right here is the amount. The amount is 150. 150 is 25% of the base, of 600. The important thing is how you solve this problem. The words themselves, you know, those are all really just definitions.."
Math,"Alright, now let's do this together. And there's a couple of ways that you could think about it. One way to think about is Peeta scored 1,060 points, and Val scored 30% fewer. When we're saying 30% fewer, we're saying essentially take 30% of 1060 and subtract that from 1060. So 30%, so we could write that as a decimal as 0.30. 30/100 is the same thing as 30%, or we could even write this as .3. And then we would want 30% of 1060."
Math,"So if you take Peeta's score and then subtract 30% of Peeta's score, then this would give you Val's score. So that's one way to calculate it. Another way to think about is whatever you're starting with, let's call that 100%, and if you were to take out 30% of it, if you were to have 30% less, then you're going to have 70% of what you started with. So another way to think about it is we could take Peeta's score of 1060 and multiply it by 70%."
Math,"And multiplying it by 70% is the same thing as multiplying it by 0.70, which is the same thing as multiplying it by 70/100, is the same thing as 7/10. So let's just do this. So if I have 1060, and I multiply by 0.7, what do I get? Seven times zero is zero. Seven times six is 42. Seven times zero is zero, plus four is four. Seven times one is seven. And I have one digit to the right of the decimal. So there you have it, it is 742. That is how many points Val scored. Let's do another example."
Math,"So we're told there are 20% more goblins than wizards in a magic club. There are 220 goblins and wizards altogether in magic club. How many goblins are in the magic club? So pause the video and see if you can work through this on your own. So this one is an interesting one. It's gonna involve a little bit of algebra here. So what we wanna do is let's set a variable. Let's say w is the number of wizards. So that's the number of wizards. And then if we said g for goblins, let's say g for goblins."
Math,"So w plus g is equal to 220, is equal to 220. And you're like, well, how does that help me? How does that help me actually figure out how many goblins are in the magic club? I have two variables here with one equation. Well, one way to think about it is, remember, they give us some more information. They tell us there are 20%, let me box that, there are 20% more goblins than wizards. So we also know one other thing."
Math,"We know that the goblins, we know that the goblins are equal to the number of wizards plus 20%. So you could view this as wizards plus 20% of wizards. And I'm writing that as 20/100, or you could even write that as 2/10, plus 2/10 times the number of wizards. Or another way of thinking about it, goblins are equal to, if I have one of something and then I have another 2/10 of that something, then I'm gonna have 1.2 of that something. So goblins is equal to 1.2 times the wizards."
Math,"And so we could use that to substitute back in here, and then we could say the number of wizards plus the number of goblins, which happens to be 20% more than the number of wizards, is going to be equal to 220. Let me do that in that same color. Is equal to 220. Now this is pretty straightforward to solve. What is w plus 1.2w? Well, that is going to be 2.2w, 2.2w. You could view this as one w plus 1.2w is 2.2w is equal to 220. And so just divide both sides. Let me scroll down a little bit."
Math,"Divide both sides by 2.2, 2.2, and what do you get? You get w, the number of wizards is equal to, let's see, this is going to be equal to 100. The number of wizards is equal to 100. Now is that our answer? No, they're asking how many goblins are in the magic club? Well, we know that goblins are 1.2 times the wizards. So the number of goblins is going to be 1.2 times 100, which is equal to 120. So there's 120 goblins, does that make sense? 120 is 20% more than 100."
Math,"And if you add the 100 wizards to the 120 goblins, you get 220 goblins and wizards altogether. Let's do another example. Here we're told Cody was 165 centimeters tall on the first day of school this year, which was 10% taller than he was on the first day of school last year. How tall was Cody on the first day of school last year? Pause this video, see if you can figure that out. So let's just define a variable here."
Math,"Let's just say that his height on the first day of school last year, let's say that that is x. So his height on the first day of school last year is x. This year he is 10% taller, so we would add 10%, which we could say is 10/100, or we could even say that as 1/10. He's 1/10 taller. So whatever his height was last year, we're going to add 1/10 of that same height again to get to his height this year, which they tell us is 165 centimeters."
Math,"And so here we could say well, one x plus 1/10 of an x is going to be one and 1/10x is equal to 165. And now to solve for x, which remember, was his height on the first day of school last year, we divide both sides by 1.1. And so x is equal to, well, let's see what this is going to be. If I were to take 165 divided by 1.1, the first thing I would wanna do is multiply them both by 10. So that has the effect of moving this decimal place one to the right."
Math,"So really, I am now trying to figure out what 11 goes into 1,650 is. And so let's see, let me just do that step by step. 11 goes into 16 one time. One times 11 is 11. Subtract, we get a five, and we bring down a five. 11 goes into 55 exactly five times. Five times 11 is 55. Subtract. We have no remainder, but then we bring down this zero and we do it one more time. 11 goes into zero zero times. Remember, the decimal place is right over here. Zero times 11 is zero, and then we have no remainder."
Math,"So last year he was 150 centimeters. And it's always good to do a reality check. Make sure, if for example, if I divided wrong and I somehow got 15, or I got 1500, just to make sure that that wouldn't make any sense. 150 centimeters, you add 10% of that. 10% of 150 is 15 centimeters. So you add 10% of that, you indeed do get to 165 centimeters for the first day of school this year.."
Math,"What is the original price of the bracelet, before tax? So pause this video and see if you can figure this out. Well, let's think about how your sales tax is calculated. Your sales tax would be equal to the sales tax rate, I'll just call that the rate, so that's going to be equal to the rate times your original price. And what do we know here? Well they tell us what our sales tax is. Our sales tax is 72 cents, so I'll write that here."
Math,"So 72 cents is going to be equal to my sales tax rate, they also tell us that, that is 6%, is going to be equal to 6% times my original price and that's what they're asking for, the original price. So times, I'm just going to call it P for short, original price. And so you have it. We have a fairly straightforward equation now."
Math,"And now I'm just going to rewrite everything as decimal, so we could write 0.72 is equal to 6% is the same thing as six per 100, which is the same thing as six hundredths, 0.06, six hundredths times p. And now we can just divide both sides by six hundredths to solve for the original price, so let's do that. Alright. So on the right-hand side I have a P. On the left-hand side if I have 72 hundredths divided by six hundredths, well that's going to be equal to 12, 12 times six is 72."
Math,"Six hundredths times 12 would be 72 hundredths. And so this is going to be equal to 12. So the original price of the bracelet, before tax is $12. And you can verify that. 6% of $12, 0.06 times 12 is indeed 72 hundredths. Let's do another example. A store has a 25% off sale on coats. With this discount, the price of one coat is $34.50. What is the original price of the coat? So once again, pause this video and see if you can figure it out."
Math,"These examples, they're actually quite useful because you will encounter this all of the time when you are shopping or you're trying to calculate tax or you're buying something, so think about this. Can you figure out the original price of the coat? Alright, well let's just write it out the same way we did last time. Let's say our original price and then there's a 25% discount, so minus 25% of the original price is going to be equal to $34.50 because that the price with the discount."
Math,"So can we solve for the original price? So one way to think about it, this is 100% of the original price or one times the original price minus 25% of the original price is going to equal this. Well, 100% minus 25% of something is going to be 75% of our original price, this is why people use letters for variables, so they don't have to keep writing this over and over again, is going to be equal to $34.50. Now to solve for our original price we just divide both sides by 75%."
Math,"And 75%, that's the same thing as 75 per 100 or 75 hundredths. So I could divide both sides by 75 hundredths. On the left-hand side these two are equivalent, so I'll be left with my original price. And now I just have to figure out what is this going to be. So if I take 75 hundredths and let me actually multiply both of these times 100. So this is going to be the same thing as 3,450 divided by 75. I just did that to get rid of the decimals."
Math,"I moved, essentially, both of the decimals to the right two places. Multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 100. So let's see how many times 75 goes into 3,450. Let's see, 75 doesn't go into three. Doesn't go into 34. It does go into 345. What is that, four times? Four times five is 20. Four times seven is 28 plus two, 300. And then you subtract. Get 45. Bring down the zero. 75 goes into 450 six times. Six times five is 30."
Math,"Six times seven is 42 plus three is indeed 45 and we luckily have no remainder. So this right over here is going to be equal to $46. Our original price is $46. You take off one-fourth or 25%, you're left with $34.50. And that makes intuitive sense as well. Always good to just take whatever answer you have and put it back in and see if it makes sense."
Math,"In terms of if you somehow got $460 and you said taking 25% off you get to $34.50, you'd say ""Well that sounds off."" Or if you got $4 and you said you take 25% off and you got $34.50 that would have also felt off, but $46 feels right. And you can even calculate that. What's 25% of $46, subtract that from $46 and you should get $34.50.."
Math,"And it's only today. Only today. So I say, you know what, let me go buy a bunch of guavas. So I go and I buy 6 guavas. So I buy six guavas. And it ends up, when I go to the register, and we're assuming no tax, it's a grocery and I live in a state where they don't tax groceries. So for the 6 guavas, they charge me, I get the 30% off. They charge me $12.60. $12.60. So this is the 30% off sale price on 6 guavas."
Math,"I go home, and then my wife tells me, you know, Sal, can you go get 2 more guavas tomorrow? I say, sure. So the next day I go and I want to buy 2 more guavas. So, 2 guavas. But now the sale is off. There's no more 30%. That was only that first day that I bought the 6."
Math,"So how much are those two guavas going to cost me? How much are those two guavas going to cost at full price? At full price? So, a good place to start is, to think about how much would those 6 guavas have cost us at full price? This is the sale price, right here? This is the sale price. How much would those have cost me at full price? So let's do a little bit of algebra here. Pick a suitable color for the algebra. Maybe this grey color. So, let's say that x is equal to the cost of 6 guarvas."
Math,"6 guavas, at full price. So, essentially, if we take 30% off of this, we should get $12.60. So let's do that. So if we have the full price of 6 guavas, we're going to take 30% off of that. So that's the same thing as 0.30. Or I could just write 0.3. I could ignore that zero if I like. Actually, let me write it like this. My wife is always bugging me to write zeroes before decimals. So that's the full price of 6 guavas minus 0.30 times the full price of guavas."
Math,"Some I'm just taking 30% off of the full price, off of the full price. This is how we figure out the sale price. This is going to be equal to that $12.60 right there. That's going to be equal to $12.60. I just took 30% off of the full price. And now we just do algebra. We could imagine there's a 1 in front -- you know, x is the same thing as 1x. So 1x minus 0.3x is going to be equal to 0.7x. So we get 0.7x, or we could say 0.70 if you like. Same number. Point, or 0.7x, is equal to 12.60."
Math,"And once you get used to these problems, you might just skip straight to this step right here. Where you say, 70% of the full price is equal to my sale price, right? I took 30% off. This is 70% of the full price. You might just skip to this step once you get used to these problems in a little bit. And now we just have to solve for x. Divide both sides by 0.7, so you get x is equal to 12.60 divided by 0.7. We could use a calculator, but it's always good to get a little bit of practice dividing decimals."
Math,"So let's do that. So we get 0.7 goes into 12.60. Let's multiply both of these numbers by 10, which is what we do when we move both of their decimals one to the right. So the 0.7 becomes a 7. Ignore that right there. The 12.60 becomes 126, put the decimal right there. Decimal right there. And we're ready to just do straight up long division. So this is now a 7, not a .7. So 7 goes into 12 1 time. 1 times 7 is 7. 12 minus 7 is 5. Bring down the 6. 7 goes into 56 8 times. 8 times 7 is 56."
Math,"And then we have no remainder. So it's 18, and there's nothing behind the decimal point. So it;s 18, in our case, $18. So x is equal to $18. Remember what x was? x was the full price of 6 guavas. x was the full price of 6. x is the full price of 6 guavas. Now, the question is, how much will 2 guavas cost me at the full price? Well, this is full price of 6. So you immediately could figure out what's the full price of one guava. You divide 18 by 6. So 18 divided by 6 is $3. That's $3 per guava at full price."
Math,"And they're asking us, we want 2 guavas. So 2 guavas is going to be 2 times $3, so this is going to be $6. Another way you could have done it, you could have just said, hey, 6 at full price are going to cost me $18. 2 is 1/3 of 6. So 1/3 of $18 is $6. So, just to give a quick review what we did. We said the sale price on six guavas, $12.60. That's 30% off the full price. Or you could say this is 70% of the full price. 70% of the full price."
Math,"And so you could say, 30% -- so if you say x is the full price of 6 guavas, you could say the full price of 6 guavas minus 30% of the full price of 6 guavas is equal to 12.60, and that's equivalent to saying, 70% of the full price is 12.60. You divided -- then we just solved this algebraically. Divide both sides by 0.7, and then we got x, the full price of 6 guavas, is $18, or that's $3 per guava or $6 for 2. Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful.."
Math,"And if I have a negative sign with a circle around it, that's a negative integer chip and that's equal to negative one. And of course if I have exactly one positive integer chip and one negative integer chip, well then they're going to cancel out because positive one plus negative one is of course equal to zero. So let's use that to figure out this and several other problems. So negative two, how could I represent that with integer chips? Well, that's going to be two of these negative integer chips."
Math,"So negative one and then negative two. And then negative four is going to be four of these negative integer chips. So negative one, negative two, negative three, and negative four. So now how many total negative integer chips do I have? I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So that's going to be six negative integer chips or negative six. Let's do another example. Let's say I now have positive seven plus negative six. How can I represent this with integer chips? Pause this video and think about it."
Math,"Well, positive seven, you could view that as seven of these positive integer chips. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. And then negative six, you can represent that as six of these negative integer chips. So we have negative one, negative two, negative three negative four, negative five, and negative six. Now we can use the fact that every positive integer, if you have a positive and a negative integer chip, well positive one plus negative one is going to be equal to zero, so they cancel out. So those cancel."
Math,"Those also add up to zero. Those also add up to zero. Those also add up to zero. Those add up to zero. Those add up to zero. So you have a bunch of zeros and then a positive one. So all you're left with is a positive one here, so that's going to be equal to one. Let's do another example. It's really helpful to see these different scenarios. Negative five plus five, you might already suspect what that is. And pause that video. Actually try to represent it with integer chips."
Math,"Well, negative five, that's five of these negative integer chips. So that's five right there. And then positive five would be five of the positive integer chips, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And what's going to happen here? Well, those add up to zero. Those add up to zero. Those add up to zero. Those add up to zero. Those add up to zero. So you're just adding a bunch of zeros, which is of course going to give you a big zero. Last but not least, let's add three and negative eight."
Math,"And let's represent that again with integer chips. So positive three is 1, 2, 3, positive integer chips. Negative eight is, let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 of these negative integer chips. And these cancel. These cancel, lemme scratch that out a little bit better. Those cancel, those cancel, and those cancel. So you have zero plus zero plus zero plus, what do you have left over? Five of these negative integer chips. Five negative integer chips that's going to be equal to negative five. And we're done.."
Math,"So let's think about it. I want to start at negative two and then to that I want to add negative seven. So let's see what's going on here. This number line model I guess we could call it, it's saying this is positive two right over here. It's to the right of zero. Then it subtracts seven. This is the model that would be for positive two plus negative seven, or two, or positive two minus seven. But that's not what we have over here, we have negative two minus seven."
Math,"This one right over here, let's see, this first... I guess you could say this thing, this arrow, it's going one, two, three, four, five to the left of zero. So starting at negative five, and then it goes another one, two, three, four to the left of that. So you could view this as negative five minus four. Or you could view this as negative five plus negative four, but that's not what we have up here. And then this last one, hopefully this is the answer, otherwise there would be a mistake in the exercise."
Math,"Let's see, we have this first arrow that takes us two steps to the left of zero. So, one, two. So this is negative two, and then we take another seven steps to the left of that. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So you can think of this arrow as representing negative two, and then we're going to that, so we're starting from this tip of this arrow. We're going to add a negative seven which makes us move seven to the left again to get to negative nine."
Math,"So that's definitely the model that represents that expression. Let's keep going. All right. Which number line model represents the expression six plus negative two. So here, they've taken our number lines but they've made them go up and down, they've made them vertical. So we wanna really think about it. I want to start at six and I want to add negative two. So on a vertical number line like this, it seems like we're increasing as we go up. I want to start at six above zero."
Math,"So, I want to start at six above zero, but then I want to add negative two, which should take me two steps back down. This one takes me two steps even higher, so this one right over here is positive six plus two, or positive six plus positive two. This one over here we're starting at positive four and then we're adding two, so that's not what we're talking about. This one over here, this big arrow, this tall arrow. This is going, it's pointing up. It gets us to positive six."
Math,"The tip of the arrows are at positive six, But then we're going back down too. So this would be positive six plus negative two. You could think of this arrow as representing positive six, and then this arrow is representing negative two. It takes us two down. So if you take positive six plus negative two, you do the positive six. And from the tip of your arrow, from there you can start the negative two, and you go two back down and you end up at four. So it's definitely that one right over there."
Math,"This is surprisingly fun. Let's keep going. Which number line model represents the expression negative 2/5 plus 4/5? So we're going to start at negative 2/5 which is going to be, it's negative, it's going to be to the left of zero. So let's see, this arrow right over here, this is negative 4/5, so that's not going to be quite right. So the second choice, what's going on here? So if I start at zero, and then I'm going 2/5 to the left of zero."
Math,"So that's negative 2/5 and from that, I'm going to the right 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5. So this looks right. This looks like negative 2/5, so I'm starting at zero, I'm going to the left 2/5. So that's negative 2/5, and then I go to the right 4/5 from that tip. >From negative 2/5, I'm adding 4/5. So that looks right. Let's do one more. This is exciting. Even if you don't find it fully exciting, anything you do you should convince yourself it's exciting. You'll do a better job."
Math,"Which number line model represents the expression five 1/2 plus negative three? This is positive five 1/2, so I want to go five 1/2 to the right of zero. This is five 1/2 to the left of zero, so that's negative five 1/2. That's not what I want to deal with. So this one looks interesting, and this is actually five 1/2 to the left of zero as well, so it's probably going to be this but let's just look at it. So let's see, we go five 1/2 to the right of zero."
Math,"So this is five 1/2, and then from that I go three left. So that in the end gets me to two 1/2. So it's this choice, right over there. Exciting.."
Math,"I intentionally have not marked off any of the numbers. We can just build an intuition for what's going to happen here. So if we're talking about -11, you could think about that as 11 to the left of zero, or if you start at zero right over here, we are going to go 11 to the left, which I'm just estimating. I have nothing marked here, but let's just say that gets us right about there. Now to that, I am going to add -3. So if I start at -11 and I add -3, I'm gonna go three more to the left."
Math,"I'm gonna go three more even more in the negative direction. So it's going to go something like that, and I'm going to end up even more negative, even further from zero, further to the left from zero than I was at -11. You might already be guessing what that is, but we'll think about that more in a little bit. Let's do another example."
Math,"Let's say, -11 plus 3, what would that look like? Well, we have the same -11, going on right over here, which we already drew, but now let me do plus 3 in a different color, let me do it in green so we don't get confused. So negative 11 plus 3. So if we start at -11 right over here, but now we're adding 3. So now I'm gonna go to the right. So notice, here, I'm still ending up left of zero on the number line, so I'm still going to end up in a negative place, but it is less negative."
Math,"It's left, it's less to the left that negative 11 was. But that's interesting, I'm still gonna get a negative value. Now, let's imagine if I were to have +11 plus -3, think about what would happen there. So +11, lemme do this in this red color, it might look something like this, +11 would look something like that. I'm starting at zero and I go 11 to the right and now I'm going to add -3 to that, I'm going to add negative three. So where I left off here, I'm now going to go three."
Math,"Am I going to the right or to the left? What's a -3? I'm going to go to the left over here. So it might get us someplace right around there. So I went 11 to the right and then I go 3 to the left. So I'm still going to end up to the right. I'm still going to have a positive value, but it's going to be less positive than that 11 over there. Now, let's give one more scenario and this is one that you're probably familiar with for many years. If I had +11 plus 3. Well, I have that +11 in red already over there."
Math,"And then if I were to add 3. it would get me even more positive and I think you know what that probably is if you go even more positive. So there's a couple of interesting patterns. If we are adding numbers of the same signs, if we're adding two negatives, we still end up with a negative. If we add two positives, we still end up with a positive. But when we're adding numbers of different signs, you actually end up taking on the sign of whichever one is further from zero."
Math,"So for example, when I took -11 plus 3, I still end up with an answer that is to the left of zero, something that is negative because 11 is further to the left of zero than 3 is moving in the right direction. And then when we did 11 plus -3, it was the other way around. Hopefully we've built up some intuition and now what I'm gonna do is tackle these exact same problems, but we're gonna do it with a number line that actually has the number marked off and we can actually compute what these are going to be."
Math,"So let me delete all of this and then let me give ourselves, let's mark these things off, and then let's do the same ones over again. So if I were to say -11 plus -3, what would that get us? I'll try to remember the colors I just used. - 11, I can start at zero here and I'm going to go to the left, 11, and I get to, whoops, I went a little bit too far. I'm gonna go all the way -5, -10, right over here, - 11, gets me right over there. And then to that I am going to add -3."
Math,"So to that I'm going to, different color, let me do this carefully. To that, I am going to add -3. So I start there and I'm gonna go three more to the left. So 1, 2, 3. So I am going to end up right over there. And where do I end up? That is at -14. So this is equal to negative, lemme do this in a neutral color, it's equal to -14. Now, let's, actually, let's do this in different orders just to see what's going on here."
Math,"Let's do the, essentially, something very similar, but let's go to the right of the number line. Let's do 11 plus 3. So 11 plus 3, we could start with +11. So let me do that in red, so +11 would look like that, that's that right over there. And then I am going to add 3. So I'm going to add 1, 2, 3, and I get to +14. So notice, here I ended up 14 to the right of zero, here I ended up 14 to the left of zero. But now let's look at the scenarios where we had mixed signs. So let's say we have -11 plus 3."
Math,"What do we think that is going to be equal to? So we already have drawn -11. That is negative 11, right over there. And now we want to think about plus 3, so we're gonna start right over here, and I'll do it a little bit higher so we can see ourselves. And then plus three, we're gonna go three to the right from that point. So 1, 2, 3. Where do we end up? Well, this right over here is -8, so we are now at -8. Now let's do it, let's do the other way around."
Math,"If we had +11 plus -3 what is that going to be equal to? Well, we've already drawn +11 here, but now we're adding -3. - 3 is in this, like, salmon color looking thing. They're very close, but different. So now we're going to add -3 to +11, so we start here, but we're gonna go three to the left 'cause it's negative. So 1, 2, 3. And where do we end up? We end up at +8.."
Math,"Well number chips, I can either have a negative number chip like that or I could have a positive number chip like that, and if you have one negative and one positive, if you were to combine these two, they could essentially cancel out to just zero because they're opposites of each other, and we've looked at that in other videos, but let's go to actually representing this up here. So negative eight could be represented as eight of these negative number chips. So let me do that over here."
Math,"So that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. Now if we're subtracting a negative number, this negative number right over here, you could view this as two negative number chips, but we're going to be taking those away because we have a subtraction right over here. So if we start with negative eight, if we wanna subtract negative two, we can just take away two of these negative number chips, so let's just do that."
Math,"And then how many negative number chips are we left with? We have one, two, three, four, five, six. So this is going to be, is that going to be six or negative six? Well these are negative number chips, so this is going to be equal to negative six. Now let's up it a little bit and let's start with something that might seem a little bit intuitive, and once again, there's many ways to approach this. Maybe the number chip technique will resonate with you for building a little bit of an intuition."
Math,"Let's say we wanna figure out four minus seven. What is that going to be equal to? Well four is a positive number, so I think I'm gonna use some positive number chips to represent four. I could represent that as one, two, three, and four positive number chips."
Math,"Now, if I'm taking away seven, I could say hey, I'm gonna, and I'm taking away a positive seven here, so that would be equivalent to taking away seven positive number chips, but I don't have seven positive number chips here, so what could I do? Well, I talked before, if I have one positive and one negative, they cancel out, so I can add these pairs of positive and negative number chips until I get to seven so that I can then take them away. So let me do that."
Math,"So I'm gonna add a positive and I'm going to add a negative. Let me make sure I'm doing that same color. So this, once again, this is still four, because these two right over here, these cancel out. These are just zero, so you're just left with positive four. So I can do that, frankly, as many times as I want, and I still have four. So let me do that again. This is still equal to four, because once again, each of these pairs cancel out to just a zero. And let me do that again."
Math,"And once again, my goal is to have seven positive number chips 'cause I need to take away a positive seven, so let me put the negative right over here. So this is all, right over here, equivalent to four. It's equivalent to what we had before, but by adding these pairs, I now have seven positive number chips."
Math,"Now, if I'm taking away a positive seven, I can take away seven, let me do this in another color, I can take away seven positive number chips, and I have seven now, so I'm gonna take away one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Now, what am I left with? Well all the positive number chips are gone, and all I have left are three negative number chips, so this is going to be negative three. Three negative number chips is the same thing as negative three. Let's do another example."
Math,"Let's say that I wanna do positive five minus negative one. Why don't you pause this video and see if you can do this with number chips. All right? Well let's first represent that positive five with five positive number chips, so that's one, two, three, four, and then five. Now, we're not taking away a positive number. If we were taking away a positive number, we could just take away some of these positive number chips."
Math,"We're taking away a negative number, so we need to have negative number chips in order to take 'em away. So, and we're only taking away one negative one, or we're taking away one negative number chip, I should say, so let's add one of those pairs. Remember, we can keep adding pairs 'cause it doesn't change the value because they cancel out. So let's add a pair. This is one positive number chip, and then let's put a negative number chip right over there."
Math,"This quantity that's represented with number chips is still five because these last two cancel out, and you're just left with one, two, three, four, five. The whole reason why I added this pair here is now I can take away a negative one. That negative one is represented by this negative number chip right over here, so if I take that away, this taking away negative one, that's taking away a negative number chip."
Math,"And now what am I left with? Well I'm now left with one, two, three, four, five, six positive number chips, or that's just a positive six.."
Math,"We already see that right over here in the equation. Then from positive four, from the tip of this arrow, we then go one, two, three, four, five, six spaces to the left. So what we just did here is we just added a negative six to the positive four. Positive four plus negative six. Where does that put us? Well we see it puts us one, two spaces to the left of zero and each of these spaces in this diagram are one. So two spaces to the left of zero is going to be negative two. This is fun."
Math,"Let's keep doing more examples. Write an addition equation or a subtraction equation, your choice, so they're giving us some choice, to describe the diagram. Alright, let's see what's going on here. We're starting at zero and we're going one, two, three, four to the left. So if we're going four to the left or so we can say negative four, -4. And then we're going to go another one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine to the left. So we could write this as negative four minus nine is equal to."
Math,"And when you go four to the left and then you go another nine to the left, you end up 13 to the left of zero which is negative 13. Equals negative 13. So this way I've written it as a subtraction equation I guess you could say. Negative four minus nine, is equal to negative 13. Now another way I could have done it, I could have said negative four plus negative nine is equal to negative thirteen as well. Either of those would have been legitimate. Now I've written it as an addition equation."
Math,"Let's keep going. Fill in the blanks to complete the equation that describes the diagram. So we're starting at zero, we go three to the left of zero, that's negative three. Then we go another three to the left of that. So we're going to add another negative three. We're going to add another negative three and that puts us six to the left of zero. Well six to the left of zero is negative six. And we're done.."
Math,"So we're going to start at negative 10 right over here, so let's look at that on the number line. That's negative 10 right over there. We're gonna start over there, and then we are adding positive six. So what do we do? Well we start here, and as I mentioned, we're going to go six units to the right because it's a positive six, so one, two, three, four, five, six. So we're going to go right over there."
Math,"We started at the negative 10, and since we're adding positive six, we go six units to the right, and we end up right over here at negative four, so this is equal to negative four. Now let's do this one. Where are we starting? We are starting at negative eight, so that's negative 10, negative nine, negative eight is right over there. Now, we're going to subtract negative two, so let's be very careful here."
Math,"If we were adding negative two, we would go two units to the left, like that, but we're subtracting negative two, so we're going to do the opposite. We're going to instead, instead of going two units to the left, we're going to go two units to the right. So we're gonna go one, two units to the right, and we are going to end up right over there, so that's negative seven, negative six. So this is equal to negative six."
Math,"Remember, if we were adding negative two, we would've gone two units to the left, but when you subtract, you do the opposite of what you would've otherwise done, so now we're going two units to the right, even though it's a negative two, 'cause we're subtracting negative two. All right. We're starting at four in the third example. So, we're starting right over here at four, and we're adding negative seven. So, negative seven, you're just going to move the absolute value of that to the left."
Math,"So the absolute value of negative seven is just seven, so you're gonna move seven units to the left, and we're not subtracting that so we're just going to just move seven units to the left. We're not gonna do the opposite of that or anything like that, so we just go seven units to the left. We're adding negative seven so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. We end up right over here. So we have positive four minus seven."
Math,"We've gone seven units to the left and now we're at, let's see, this is zero, negative one, negative two, negative three, so that is equal to negative three. Now this last one, try to do it on your own before we do it together. All right. Now some of you might be tempted to say oh, five and negative five, aren't those additive inverses? Don't those just cancel out? Well they would if you were adding. Five plus negative five is equal to zero, but here we're doing five minus negative five."
Math,"So let's just do it step by step. We're starting at five. Now if we were adding negative five to that, we would go five units to the left and we would end up at zero, but we are not adding negative five. We are subtracting negative five, so instead of going five units to the left, we're going to go five units to the right, so one, two, three, four, five. We end up right over there, and so we end up at 10, and we are done.."
Math,"I'm going to go six more to the right of zero to end up at seven, which is going to be seven to the right of zero. The number that is six to the left of one on the number line. Now six to the left of one, in this type of a number line, which is the standard number line, where to the right is positive and to the left is negative. If you move six to the left that means you're subtracting six from one so that's not right. We're adding six. The number that is six to the right of one on the number line."
Math,"Yeah, that's exactly right. We're going six to the right. If you're adding six you're moving to the right. You're going to increase. So that's definitely going to be the choice. Let's keep going. Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the expression three plus negative seven? So before I even look at these choices, one way I would think about it is I would start at three and then I would move seven to the left of three. I'm adding negative sevens."
Math,"So this is the same thing as three minus seven. So I'd move seven to the left of three. So let's see they would say. Start at seven on the number line and move three to the left. Well that doesn't make sense. I want to start at three. And let's skip over to here. Start at three on the number line and move seven to the left. Yeah, that's exactly right."
Math,"We're going to start at three, and then we're going to move seven in the negative direction into the left, if our convention, which is our standard convention, that to the left is negative and to the right is more positive. So that's going to be exactly right. Let's do one more. So now they have three minus negative four. Well one way to think about it is three minus negative four is the same thing if you subtract a negative, it's the same thing as adding the positive version."
Math,So it's the same thing as three plus four. And so I would want to start at three and then move four to the right. Because once again this is the same thing as three plus four. Three minus negative four is the same thing as three plus four. So I want to start at three and move four to the right. Start at three and move four to the right. This would be the same thing as three plus four which is the same thing as that expression..
Math,"Well, let's do this together. So we're starting with negative one. We could represent negative one as just one integer, one negative integer chip, but we need to subtract seven, positive seven from that. We have no positive integer chips here, so, and we need to have at least seven positive integer chips in order to subtract seven. So how could we get some positive integer chips? Well, we can just add pairs of negative and positive integer chips."
Math,"So if I add one negative integer chip and I add one positive integer chip, just like that, this is still negative one over here because these two integer chips are going to cancel each other out. So let me just do that seven times. So let me just do this. So that's two, three, four, five, six and seven. And then I just have to add the corresponding positive integer chips three, four, five, six and seven. So notice, what I just wrote, this is just another way of writing negative one."
Math,"But I wrote it this way because I can actually subtract out positive seven now from this. So now let's subtract out positive seven. So subtract out one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then what are we left with? Well, we're left with all of this business right over here. And what is that? That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. This is equal to negative eight. Now that's interesting by itself, but you might notice something."
Math,"What I have left over when I take a negative one and I subtract positive seven from that, I'm left with essentially the equivalent of negative one and negative seven. So another way of writing what we just have left over here is I have negative one is that one negative integer chip right over there. And then I have negative seven, these seven negative integer chips right over there. So you could also view this as the same thing as negative one plus negative seven."
Math,"And so this makes us think about something. Is it true that if I subtract a positive, that's the same thing as adding the inverse of that positive, adding, in the case of a positive seven, in the case of subtracting a positive seven, that's gonna be the same thing as adding a negative seven? Interesting. And let's see actually if it works the other way around. So let's see what happens when we subtract a negative."
Math,"So if we have negative three minus negative five, maybe, maybe this is the same thing as negative three plus the opposite of negative five, which would be positive five. Let's see if these two things actually amount to be the same thing. So let's just start with this first one up here. We're gonna start with negative three, so that gives us three negative integer chips. So negative one, negative two, negative three."
Math,"Now if we wanna subtract out negative five, if we wanna take away five negative integer chips, well we need more negative integer chips here. We need at least two more negative integer chips. So if we have two more negative integer chips, we're not changing the value of that if we have two more positive integer chips. What I have depicted here is still negative three because that and that cancel out."
Math,"And so this is still the number negative three being represented, but I added these two pairs because now I can subtract out five negative integer chips. That's what negative five represents. These top four negative integer chips, there's five of 'em, I can take 'em all away. That's subtracting out a negative five. And what am I left with? What I'm left with is just these two positive integer chips. So this is going to be equal to positive two."
Math,"Well, that's interesting because that's kind of feeling very similar to what we have here. If we start with negative three, so negative one, negative two, negative three, and I add a positive five, so five positive integer chips, one, two, three, four and five. Well, we already know that that cancels with that, that cancels with that, that cancels with that. This is the equivalent of positive two."
Math,"And what I just did here on both sides, this isn't a proof that this will always work, but hopefully this gives you an intuition that it does seem to work. And I will tell you that without giving you the full proof that it actually does always work, that it is actually the case that if you subtract a number, it's the same thing as adding the opposite of that number. If you subtract a number it's the same thing as adding the opposite of that number.."
Math,"And to that, it looks like I might be adding or subtracting something. And we have this arrow that starts exactly at the tip of that nine and then it goes, let's see, one, two, three, four units to the left. So I could think about this arrow right over here as just subtracting four, so it could just be nine minus four, which is of course equal to where we end up; which is equal to this five right over here. So that's one way to represent what is going on as an addition or subtraction equation."
Math,"But what's another way? We could start with the nine And is there anything that we could add to the nine that would get us the same result? Well, we know when we add negative numbers, we also move that many units to the left. So you could also view this purple arrow right over here, instead of viewing it as subtracting a positive four, you could view it as adding a negative four, adding a negative four. Now, this is interesting."
Math,"Because in this case, when I subtract a positive number, it's the same thing as adding the opposite of it. Now will that work the other way around? If I subtract a negative number, is that the same thing as adding the opposite? Let's say we had negative five minus negative three. What is that going to be equal to? And let's think about this with integer chips. So we could start with five negative integer chips, one, two, three, four and five."
Math,"And now I'm going to take away three of those negative integer chips. So I'm gonna take away one, two, three of them. And so what am I left with? I am left over here with negative two. So if we think about it on a number line, let me do that right over here. So if I have a number line, and let's say that this is zero here and I'm gonna go negative one, two, three, four, five."
Math,"So negative five, so this negative five right over here, I can represent, I can start at zero, and I could go five units to the left. And I know when I subtract negative three, I'm gonna end up at negative two. So I know I'm gonna end up, I'm gonna end up, I'll do this in a different color. I'm gonna end up right over here. So subtracting negative three needs to be the same thing as moving three units to the right. If I was adding negative three, I'd go three units to the left."
Math,"But subtracting negative three must be the same thing as going three units to the right. Well, what also is the same thing as going three units to the right? Well that's the same thing as adding three. So this is going to be the same thing. So negative five minus negative three is actually the same thing as negative five plus three. This purple arrow right over here, you could view it as subtracting negative three or you could view it as adding the opposite of negative three."
Math,"So it looks like when you subtract a number it's the same thing as adding the opposite. When you subtract a number it's the same thing as adding the opposite. Now that's really useful, because now we can even think about doing things with things that aren't even integers. We can start thinking about just rational numbers. For example, negative fractions."
Math,"So if we take that principle we just came up with, and if we say, okay, well what's three minus negative two fifths? Well, if we take that principle that subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its opposite. subtracting negative two fifths is the same thing as adding the opposite of negative two fifths. So it's adding two fives. Well, we have seen this type of thing before and we could even do that on a number line. Lemme do that right over here. So, let's say that this is three, four and five."
Math,"So we're starting here with a three in either case. So that's three units to the right, a positive three. And so subtracting a negative two-fifths, we're saying is the same thing as adding two-fifths. So adding two-fifths, we are just moving two-fifths to the right. So it's one-fifth and two-fifths. So we're just going to do that. Subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its opposite.."
Math,"Steve has a net worth of -3. Steve's uncle cares about Steve and feels bad that he doesn't even have a 0 net worth; he has a negative net worth! And so Steve's uncle wants to at least take away some of this pain. He at least wants to get Steve back to a neutral net worth, a 0 net worth. So he decides to take away Steve's negative net worth. He wants to take away that -3. What happens if you take away that -3? Well, that should get you back to 0. If you take away anything..."
Math,"if you have something and you take it away, it should go back to 0. Similarly if you owe people things and that owing people things is taken away, it also gets back to 0. And another way to think about it is how Steve's uncle would actually take that liability, take that debt away from Steve. Well, the easiest way he could do it if Steve is starting at -3 net worth is for his uncle to give Steve $3, so that he(Steve) can get back to a net worth of 0."
Math,"So hopefully, that makes it a little bit clearer, that this and this are intuitively equivalent.."
Math,"So why don't you pause this video and see if you can work through this before we do it ourselves. All right, so let's just start at 4. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. We could just say where is 4 on the number line. 4 is here. One, two, three, four. We're going to start there, and we're going to add something to that 4 to get us to -6. To get us right there. So what are we going to add? Well, we're going to be moving to the left. So we're going to be adding a negative number right over here."
Math,"And we can see what that negative number is going to be. How many units do we have to move to the left? We have to move one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 to the left. So what do we add if we want to move 10 to the left? We have to add a -10. So this is -10 right over here. Another way to think about it, if you're four to the right of zero, well, it's going take you four just to get back to zero. That's four there. And it's going to take you another six to get you to -6."
Math,"And then of course you're moving to the left, so that's going to be a -10. Let's do another a example. So let me scroll down a bit so we can see that second example. So once again, find the missing value. And pause this video again and try to work that out. All right, so there's a couple of ways we could think about it. We're saying -3 is equal to something plus 5. So let's just see where -3 is on this number line. - 3 is right over there. And something plus 5 is going to be equal to -3."
Math,"So plus 5, you could view it as you're going to start someplace, and you're going to move five units to the right, something like that to get to where you end up. So where could we start to get five units to the right and be at -3? Well, if we just go five units to the left, so one, two, three, four, five. If you start from this point, and you were to add 5, you were get to -3. And so what is this point right over here? Well, this right over here, let's see, this is -5, -6, -7, -8."
Math,"So we have -8 plus 5 is equal to -3. Another way to think about it is, you could have used a commutative property to say, ""Hey, instead of blank plus 5, you could say this is -3 is equal to 5 plus blank. And so you could say, let's start at 5, let me do this in another color. Let's start at 5, and then what would I have to add to it to get to -3? And so, well, I would have to move to the left five and then three in order to get to -3. So you would essentially have to add -8."
Math,So that's another way that you could think about that..
Math,"Let's see, I'm gonna be dealing with -3 and I'm gonna subtract something of it to get to -4, so let me focus on the negative end here. So, let's say this is zero, that could be +1. Then, I have -1, -2, -3, - 4, -5, let's go -6. That's the other end of it. So, this is -1, -2, -3, - 4, and -5. So, let's start at -3. So, -3 is that point on the number line and I want to end up at -4, that is that point on the number line. So, to go from -3 to -4, I have to go one step in the leftward direction."
Math,"So, one step in the leftward direction, you could either view that as subtracting 1 or you could view that as adding a -1. Now, we have, we're already subtracting here, so the simplest thing to do would just say, ""Okay, this is the same thing as subtracting 1."" And we're done, -3 minus 1 is indeed equal to -4. Let's do another example. Let's say we had -1 is equal to -7, minus what? Pause a video and try to work through that. And try to do a number line, I always find that useful."
Math,"All right, let's work through this together again, so let me draw a number line here. Let's see, I have a -1, I have a negative, I have a -7, so I'm gonna deal with the negate end of things. So, let me make this zero, I'll make that positive 1, - 1, -2, -3, - 4, -5, -6, -7. Let me write this, this is -7 right over here, - 8, -9, -10. I think that's probably enough. So, let's see."
Math,"We're saying -1 is equal to -7 minus something, so essentially we're starting at -7 here, we're starting at -7, and we're subtracting something from that to end up over here at -1. This is -1 right over there. So, let's just think about what the arrow needs to go do to get from -7 to -1. Well, to do, that you're going to have to go, it looks like six units to the right. One, two, three, four, five, six, we go six units to the right. Now, there's two ways to describe going six units to the right."
Math,"You could say that is just plus 6, or you could view that that's the same thing as minus -6. And we've seen that, subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its inverse. And since we already have a a negative sign here or minus sign here, we might as well say, ""Well, this is the same thing as subtracting a -6,"" a -6, I'll put in parentheses to make it a little bit cleaner, and we're done. Let's do another example, another example here. So, let's say we make, give ourselves a clean slate."
Math,"Let's say we wanted to figure out so I have blank minus -5 is equal to 13. How would you tackle that? Well, let me just draw my number line again. I have my whole real estate to use this time, so let me just go all the way there. And let's see, I'm dealing with something, it's gonna be roughly five away, it feels like from 13. So, let me just make my number line, I'm just gonna say this is zero, I have to get to 13, so actually let me give myself a little bit more space."
Math,"So, this is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. I think that is sufficient. So, we don't know where we're starting, we know we wanna end up at 13. So, 13, let me put that on our number line here, so it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. So, 13 is right over here. And now how did we get to 13? Well, we are subtracting a -5."
Math,"Now, as I just mentioned, subtracting a number is the same thing as adding the inverse of the number, so this is the same thing as adding +5 is another way of thinking about that. So, or another way of depicting either of these, subtracting -5 or adding +5 would essentially be you're starting someplace and you're going 5 units to the right. So, you started someplace and you're going 5 units to the right to end up at 13. So, that means you started 5 units to the left, one, two, three, four, five."
Math,"You started right over here, you go 5 units to the right and you ended up at 13. Well, this right over here, 5 units to the left of 13, this is going to be 8. And it is indeed the case that 8 minus -5 is equal to 13. Now, there's other ways that you might be able to think about this. If something minus -5 is equal to 13 then another way you could think about it, if I were to tell you that 3 minus 2 is equal to 1, you could also say that an equivalent statement is that 3 is equal to 1 plus 2."
Math,"You could turn that subtraction equation into an addition equation. So, over here, if I say this minus this is equal to that then that means that 13 plus -5 must be equal to blank, our mystery number. And if I add 13 and -5, you might recognize that as being equal to 8. So, either way, there's a lot of ways that you could approach this, but they all get you to kind of the same conceptual place.."
Math,"Everywhere we see a Y, we replace with a five. So this is a Y right over here, and then of course, and then of course this is an X. Let's do that. So instead of that X, let's write negative two. So we have negative two minus and then we have in the parentheses a negative Y. Y is equal to, Y is equal to five."
Math,"Now what is this going to evaluate to? Well, this is the same thing as negative two, now subtracting a negative five, so all of this business here, subtracting a negative five, that's the same thing as adding a five. So it's going to be negative two plus five, which is equal to three. This is going to be equal to three. And there's several ways to think about this. my brain thinks okay, I'm starting at negative two."
Math,"If I add two I get to zero and then I would have to add another, and then I have to add another three so that gets me to three. You can even view this as, you can even view this, my brain kind of says negative two, well let's see, I have to add, i have to add two to get back to zero and then I have to add another three if I want to add a total of five. So this is going to be zero plus three gets me to three. Another way to think about it, negative two plus five is the same thing as five minus two."
Math,"Five minus two, which is of course equal to three. Or you could of course draw it on a number line. And you would say if you start at negative two and you take five steps to the right, you get to positive three. Let's do another one of these. This one's a little bit more, a little bit more complex. So let's see. We're told to evaluate three minus negative six plus negative H plus negative four, where H is equal to negative seven. Well there's two ways you could do it."
Math,"I could just take the negative seven and replace it, the H with that negative seven, or I could actually try to simplify this expression first and then do the substitution for H. Let's actually do that. My brain feels like doing that. So this expression, I have the three, but instead of subtracting a negative six, instead of subtracting a negative six, that's gonna be the same thing as just adding six. So three plus six."
Math,"And adding a negative H, adding a negative H, adding a negative H, that's the same thing as just subtracting H. So three plus six minus H, and then adding a negative four, adding a negative four, that's the same thing as subtracting four. That's the same thing as subtracting four. And now of course we can do this in any, you know, addition and subtraction we have we can change the order in which we do it. So let's do that just to kind of simplify all of this."
Math,"So, actually first of all, I can figure out what three plus six is. Three plus six is equal to nine. And then I have this minus four here. So I could say nine minus four, actually I want to be careful not to skip any steps. So three plus six, three plus six, in a color that you can see, so three plus six is nine. So that's nine minus H minus four, minus four. Now I could change the order in which I do this addition or subtraction, so this is going to be the equivalent of nine minus four."
Math,"Nine minus four minus H, minus H. And I just did that so I can simplify and figure out what nine minus four is. Nine minus four, of course, let me do this in blue, navy blue. Nine minus four is five. So this whole thing simplified to five minus H before I even did the substitution. And now I can substitute H with negative seven."
Math,"So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, when I do the substitution, I'll write it up here, it's going to be five minus, I'll do the minus in that magenta color, minus and now where I see an H, I'm gonna replace it with negative seven. Five minus negative seven. You want to be very careful there, you might be tempted to say, oh I have a negative here, negative here, let me just replace H with a seven. Remember, H is negative seven, so you're subtracting H."
Math,"You're gonna subtract negative seven. So this is five minus negative seven, which is the same thing, which is the same thing as five plus seven. Five plus seven, which we all know is equal to 12. And we're done. Let's do a few more of these. You can't really get enough practice here, this is some important foundational skills for the rest of your mathematical lives. (laughing) Alright. So consider, I don't make you too stressed about it. Consider the following number line."
Math,"Alright, so we've got a number line here and let's see, they didn't mark off all the numbers here. This is negative four, E is at this point, this is then we go to two. So it looks like we're counting by twos here, that this is negative two, this is zero, yep. Negative four, if you increase by two, negative four, negative two, zero, two, four, this would be a six. This would be a negative six."
Math,"They intentionally left those numbers off, so we had to figure out that hey, look, between negative four and two, to go from negative four to two, you have to increase by six and we only have one, two, three hashmarks. So each of those hashmarks must be increasing by two. Well anyway, now we know, now we know what all the points in the number line are. Evaluate E minus F. Well we know, we know that E is equal to negative two. And we know, we know that F is equal to four."
Math,"So this is going to be the same thing, E is equal to negative two minus, minus positive four. Minus positive four. Let me do it in that same blue color. Minus four. Well negative two minus four, we have the number line in front of us, this is just going to be negative six. If you start at negative two, you subtract, if you subtract two you get to negative four, you subtract another two, you get to negative six. So we are done. Let's do one more of these. Let's evaluate T plus negative U."
Math,"Where once again T and U are on this number line and it looks like each of these hashmarks we're incrementing by three as we go up. Zero, three, six. And if we go down, zero, negative three, negative six. So it's clear that U is equal to three. U is equal to three and it is also clear that T is equal to negative six. T is equal to negative six. So T plus negative U is going to be, so it's going to be negative six plus, negative six plus negative U, U is three. U is three."
Math,"You want to be very careful, you might say oh well U is positive so I'm just gonna put a positive number here, but remember, it's negative U. Wherever you see the U, replace it with the three. So it's negative three. So this is gonna be six plus negative three, or sorry, negative six plus negative three, which we can rewrite as negative six minus three. All of this business can be rewritten as negative six minus three. Negative six minus three."
Math,"If you're at negative six and you go three to the left, you go three more negative, you're going to end up at negative nine. And we're all done.."
Math,"So just to get our bearings, let's see, three hash marks to the left of zero is negative three. So each hash mark we must be going down by one. So this must be negative one, negative two, and this is negative three. And then so as we go to the right, each hash mark must increase by one. So zero, one, two, and then three. And then this just helps us get a little more bearings. But let's just think about each of these expressions. So this first one is q minus n. And q is to the right of n on the number line."
Math,"We know that q is greater than n. So if q is greater than n and you're subtracting n from q it actually doesn't matter if they're both negative or both positive or one's negative and one's positive. Just the fact that we know that q is greater than n that means that q minus n is going to be positive. And if you actually want to look at this particular circumstance, q is positive, n is negative. If you subtract a negative, you're going to essentially add a positive."
Math,"So this value right over here, not only is it going to be positive, it's going to be a positive value greater than q. And if we had to compare it versus q, we would know that it's greater than q, but they don't ask us to do that. Now we have n. n is a negative value. It's a negative number. And it's a negative number between negative one and negative two. It looks like it's approximately negative 1.8."
Math,"We don't know for sure but if we just eyeball it, this thing is negative and it looks like it's approximately negative 1.8. Now what's n minus q? n minus q? So it's going to be the negative of q minus n. So n minus q, we have the smaller number and from that we're subtracting the larger number. So this thing right over here is going to be negative. So the largest of these values is definitely going to be q minus n which is going to be positive."
Math,"And then we have to figure out which is going to be more negative. This n value or this n minus q value? Well let's think about it a little bit. We could just try to approximate what q is. And if we look at it, q looks like it's approximately this looks like roughly 0.8 and this looks like it's approximately, we've already said, negative 1.8. So if we make those assumptions right over here this thing is going to be approximately negative 1.8 minus 0.8 which is equal to negative 2.6."
Math,"So when you look at it like this you clearly see that this is going to be more negative than this right over here. So this is the smallest, and this is the largest, or the greatest I should say maybe. Maybe let me call this the least. That might be better because sometimes when people say small and large they're referring to absolute value. But let's say this is the least and this is the greatest."
Math,"So if we wanted to order them we would go n minus q, and then if you're doing this on Khan Academy exercise, you can actually click on these and move them around, but if we can't, it will be n minus q which is the most negative, then you have n which is still negative but not as negative. This is roughly negative 1.8, this is roughly negative 2.6. And then q minus n which is going to be roughly positive 2.6. So this is the greatest. And so let's do the next question."
Math,"Order the, whoops, order the following expressions by their values from least to greatest. So once again the kind of same drill although here each hash mark looks like it's a half because it takes two to get to one, so this is half. This is negative 1/2 right over here. And we want to compare a minus b, to a, to a minus 0.5. So all of them were either a, you can even think of this as a minus zero. Right that's the same thing as a. So let's see. In all these we have an a and we're subtracting something."
Math,"Where in here we're subtracting zero. I guess we're subtracting nothing. Here you're subtracting b. And here you're subtracting 0.5. So in general the more you subtract, the more that you subtract, the smaller it's going to be. So let's see. In which of these cases am I subtracting the most? Well here I'm subtracting a positive number. Here I'm subtracting zero. Here I am subtracting a b is a negative number. Here I am subtracting a negative number. b is negative. This is clearly positive."
Math,"So if you subtract a positive number from a, you're going to get a lower value than if you subtract a negative number. In fact if you subtract a negative number you're going to add to a. You're going to get a number greater than a. So the least is when you subtract the largest value or the greatest value. So a minus 0.5. We're subtracting a positive number there. We're subtracting 0.5. Followed by a where we're not subtracting anything. And then you have a minus b."
Math,"This right over here is going to be the greatest. Why is this? Well we know that b is a negative number. Notice it's below zero right over here so if b is a negative number, you subtract a negative number, you're actually going to get a value that is greater than a. Let me make it very clear. This value right over here is going to be less than a. This value over here clearly equals a. And this value over here is actually going to be greater than a. So now we've ordered it from least to greatest."
Math,"Once again if we were doing it on the Khan Academy exercises we would have a little tool where we could click and move these around. But this is the least followed by this, followed by that. Now another way that you could do it, just like we did in the last example, you could try to estimate roughly what these values are. b looks like it's, I don't know, it's not exactly, it looks like it's about negative .2, so approximately negative 0.2. Remember this is negative half. This is negative .5."
Math,"a looks like it is approximately, I don't know, negative .7, negative 0.7. And so you could actually do it with the actual values if you like, but you would get the same result.."
Math,"The way I've drawn it, b is to the right of a on our number line, and by our convention, b is going to be greater than a. So if I were to figure out the distance between a and b, what is this distance going from a, I want to draw a straight line here, this distance going from a to b, so this distance right over there, how would I figure it out? Well I could just take the larger of these two numbers, which is going to be b, and then subtract out the smaller."
Math,"So I subtract out a, and I'll be left with this distance. This will give me a positive value. When I want a distance, I just think in terms of a positive value. How far apart are these two things? But I was only able to know to do b minus a because I knew that b was greater than a. This was going to give me a positive value. What if I knew that a was greater than b? Well then I would do it the other way around. So let me draw that again. Let me draw another number line right over here."
Math,"In this world, in this world, I'm going to make a greater than b. This is b, that is a, and if I wanted to calculate the distance between b and a here, well now I would take the larger of the two, a, remember I want the positive distance here, and then I would subtract out the smaller. I would do a minus b."
Math,"Well so here I did b minus a, here I did a minus b, but what if I didn't know which one was greater? If I didn't know whether b or a was greater, what could I do? Well what you could do is just take either a minus b or b minus a and take the absolute value. If you do that, it doesn't matter if you take b minus a or a minus b."
Math,"It turns out that regardless of whether a is greater than b, or b is greater than a, or they're equivalent, that the absolute value of a minus b is equivalent to the absolute value of b minus a, and this is equivalent, either of these expressions is the distance between these numbers. I encourage you to play around with the negatives to see if you can factor out some negatives and think about the absolute value. It will actually make a lot of sense why this is true."
Math,"In another video, I might do a little bit more of a rigorous justification for it. But I think the important thing for this video is to see that this is actually true. So let's say we're in a world, let's get a number line out, and let's look at some examples. So let's say that we want to figure out the distance between, between, let's say negative two, the distance between negative two and positive three. So we can look at the number line and figure out what that distance is."
Math,"To go from negative two to positive three, or the distance between them, we see is one, two, three, four, five. Actually, let me draw a straighter line here. This distance right over here, this distance right over here is equal to five. You see it right over here. One, two, three, four, five. Or you'd have to go five backwards to go from three to negative two. But let's see that what I just wrote actually applies right over here."
Math,"So if we took negative two to be our a and three to be our b, then we could write this as the absolute value of negative two minus three, what is this going to be equal to? Well this is going to be equal to negative two minus three is negative five, so it's the absolute value of negative five. So this indeed equals five. So notice I subtracted the larger number from the smaller number. I got a negative value, but then I took the absolute value of it."
Math,"That gave me the actual distance between these two numbers. Now what if I did it the other way around? What if I took three minus negative two? So it's going to be the absolute value of three, let me do it in the blue color, the absolute value of three minus, and in parentheses I'll write the negative two. Negative two. Now if you subtract a smaller number from a larger number, you should get a positive value. So the absolute value sign here is just kind of extra."
Math,"You don't really need it, unless to verify that that's true. This is going to be three minus negative two. That's the same thing as three plus positive two, or five. So this is just going to be the absolute value of five, which of course, is equal to five. So hopefully this makes you feel good that if you want the distance between two numbers, you subtract one from the other, and it doesn't matter which order you do it."
Math,"You could subtract three from negative two, or negative two from three, be careful with the negative symbols here, and then take the absolute value, and then that is going to give you the distance between these two numbers. This is super important because later in your mathematical careers, you're going to see a math professor just say, oh, you know, I care about the distance between two variables, you know, a and b, so the distance is a minus b, and then later they might write it like this."
Math,"And then to realize that these are actually the same thing, and these are gonna give the same value, and they represent the distance between these numbers.."
Math,"So it's going to give us this distance right over here. It's going to give us this distance right over here. That is the absolute value of A minus B, which is of course the same thing as the absolute value of B minus A. So which of these expressions are equivalent? So this first one has the absolute value of A minus the absolute value of B. Well what is the absolute value of A? Well that's the distance that A is from zero. So that's going to be this distance."
Math,"This distance right over here is the absolute value of A. That's the absolute value of A right over there and then the absolute value of B is going to be this distance. That's the distance that B is from zero. So that right over there is going to be the absolute value of B. That's the absolute value of B. So if you take, if you say the absolute value of A minus the absolute value of B, what are you going to be left with? Well, you're going to be left with, you're going to be left with this distance."
Math,"You're going to be left with this distance right over here. This distance is the absolute value of A minus the absolute value of B. Absolute value of A minus this distance is gonna give you this green distance. Well that's exactly what we have up here. The absolute value of A minus B is the distance between A and B and that's what this green distance is as well. this is going to be equivalent to the absolute value of A minus B. And if you wanna really verify it, you could try it with some numbers."
Math,"I mean what they tell us about A and B is that both of them are going to be negative. They're both to the left of zero. And we also see that B is greater than A, or it's less negative than A. So you could even try it with some numbers. You could say well maybe B is negative one and A is negative five and then verify that this would be true."
Math,"Now what about the absolute value of A plus the absolute value of B? Well that would be taking this distance, this magenta distance, absolute value of A, and then adding it to this blue distance, that absolute value of B. So this would give you a larger distance than the distance between those two points. Or, you could try it with numbers. I mean, imagine a world, just like I said, imagine a world where A is equal to negative five and B is equal to negative one."
Math,"Well in this world, the distance between the two, the absolute value of A minus B would be equal to the absolute value of negative five. Negative five minus negative one. Minus negative one. Which is the same thing as the absolute value of negative five plus one. Which is equal to the absolute value of negative four. Which is equal to four."
Math,"So for these particular numbers, and I just picked them, I just picked two negative numbers where A is more negative than B, the way it's drawn, this distance in green, or this distance right over here, would be four. Now the absolute value of A, absolute value of A plus the absolute value of B, in this circumstance, is going to be equal to It's going to be the absolute value of negative five, which would just be five plus the absolute value of negative one, which would be one. This would be equal to six."
Math,"So for these numbers, once again I just picked two random numbers that met the constraints that both are negative and that A is more negative than B is, it didn't hold up. So this is not going to be the case. And I'm not going to select none of the above, because I found a choice that I know is going to be true. Let's do another one of these. Let's do several more of these."
Math,"Which of the following expressions are equivalent to the absolute value of A minus B? Once again, absolute value of A minus B, that is the distance between A and B. That is this distance that I'm drawing right now. That is this distance right over here. That is the absolute value of A minus B. Well what is this first choice? Just A minus B without the absolute value. Well we see that A is less than B, it's more to the left. In fact, A is negative and B is positive."
Math,"So if you take a negative number and then you subtract a positive number from it, you're going to get a negative number. This thing right over here is going to be negative. Or if you subtract a larger number from a smaller number, you're going to get a negative value. But the distance between these two numbers, we took the absolute value, this is a positive value. This is just a distance. So this isn't going to be the case. Now let's look at this choice. The negative of B minus A."
Math,"Well B minus A is going to be positive. How do we know that? Well B is larger than A. B is greater than A. So if B is greater than A, B minus A is going to be positive. But then we're taking the negative of it, so this whole expression is going to be negative. It is going to be negative again. Another way to think about it, B is a positive number, you subtract a negative number from it, that's the same thing as adding the absolute value of that negative number. This part is going to be positive."
Math,"But then you have this negative out front of it, it is going to be negative. And, like in the last example, you could try out numbers that meet these constraints. Maybe B is positive three and A is negative two. And I encourage you, try this out. Figure out what the absolute value of A minus B is, it'll be five. And figure out which of these give you that same result. And neither of them will. So the answer here is none of the above. Let's keep going, this is a lot of fun."
Math,"Alright, select the best interpretation of the following equation. So we have the absolute value of 11 minus X. So this is the distance between 11 and X equals the absolute value of Y minus three. So this is the distance between Y and three. So this is telling us that the distance between 11 and X is the same as the distance between Y and three. So they say the distance between 11 and X is equal to the distance between Y and three. Yeah, that's exactly, that's exactly what I just said."
Math,"So I would select that. But let's look at the other choices. The distance between 11 and a negative x is qual to the distance between Y and negative three. Well the distance between, let me underline this, the distance between 11 and negative X, let me just in a different color. The distance, I'm having trouble changing colors."
Math,"So, the distance between 11 and negative X, that's not going to be this over here, that's going to be, you could take the absolute value of 11 and then from that you would subtract negative X. That's this thing right over here. So this would actually simplify to the absolute value of 11 plus X, which is not what we have over here. And then the distance between Y and negative three, same idea. That's gonna be Y minus negative three. Which is not what we have over here."
Math,"So this is not, this is not what this equation represents. The distance between 11 and Y, okay so now they're really mixing. They're saying 11 and Y is equal to the distance between negative X and negative three. So now they've just completely mixed everything up. So that's not gonna be the case. Let's do one more of these. Let's do one more."
Math,"So we are asked, which of the following expressions is equal to the rectangle's area? Alright, so if we want to figure out the area of a rectangle, just multiply the width times the height. Or you could say the length times the height. So let's see which of these represent that. So the absolute value of J minus L. So, let me get a color here. minus L. The absolute value of J minus L."
Math,"So J minus L, so J is this X coordinate, it's gonna be negative six, and L is this X coordinate, it's going to be, it's going to be positive six. So the absolute value of J minus L is going to be our, is going to the the difference in the horizontal axis, or it's going to be the distance on the horizontal axis between this point and that point. Or you say the horizontal distance between those two points. So it would be the length of this line segment. So that is the absolute value of J minus L."
Math,"Once again, the X coordinate here is negative six, the X coordinate here is positive six, and you can even figure it out. It's going to be negative six minus six, which would be negative 12, and then you take the absolute value of that, this is going to be 12. And you don't even have to figure that out here, we just know that the length of this line is the absolute value of J minus L. So that's that. And then they have the absolute value of M minus Q. So the absolute value, the absolute value of M minus Q."
Math,"So they have M over here, that's the Y coordinate here, and Q is the Y coordinate down here. So the absolute value of M minus Q is going to be the distance, the vertical distance between these two points, which is really just, 'cause the X value isn't changing, this is actually going to be the length. This is going to be the length of that side. That's going to be the absolute value of M minus Q. So yeah, if you multiply this length times this length, you're going to get the area of the rectangle."
Math,"So I didn't even have to look at the other choices, I would definitely go with this one. But let's see where the other ones probably aren't correct. So this is the absolute value of J minus M. So here you're taking the difference of the X coordinate here and the Y coordinate over there. So that's kind of bizarre. This this already looks suspicious. Here you're saying the absolute value of J minus N. Absolute value of J, absolute value of J minus N."
Math,"Well, their X coordinates are the same, so this is actually going to be, this we actually know is going to be zero. J is equal to N, they're both equal to negative six. That's not gonna give you the length of this line, because we have no change along X here. All the change is along Y. If we wanted to figure out the length of this line right over here we would have to find the absolute value of K, of the change in our Y coordinates. So absolute value of K minus O would give you the length of this line."
Math,"And if you wanted the length of this right over here, you'd want your change in X, so that would be the absolute value of N minus P, or you could say the absolute value of P minus N. But they didn't use those choices. So yeah, we feel good about that.."
Math,"And you might be tempted to deal with the negative 7/3 and the 11/3 first because they already have a common denominator. But you have to realize that subtraction, you can't use the associative property. It's not the this, for example which is what you would typically do first is not the same thing as this right over here. So you have to be very, very, very careful. But what we could do is rewrite this, instead of saying, minus something, minus something else we could rewrite it in terms of addition."
Math,"What do I mean by that? Well, if I have 3/7, I'll start with that. Subtracting something is the same thing as adding that something's opposite. So subtracting negative 7/3 is the same thing as adding the opposite of negative 7/3 which is just positive 7/3. And subtracting 11/3 is the same thing as adding the opposite of 11/3 which is negative 11/3. Now addition, you can use the associative property, you could add these two first or you could add these two first."
Math,"And I like adding these two first because they have the same denominator. So if I have 7/3 plus negative 11/3, what is that going to get me? Well, we have a common denominator. We could rewrite it like this. 3/7 plus common denominator of 3. We could write 7 plus negative 11 in the numerator. And so 7 plus negative 11 is the same thing as 7 minus 11. Because subtracting something's the same thing as adding its opposite. So if we're adding negative 11, same thing as subtracting 11."
Math,"So 7 plus negative 11, you might, we could get a number line out, but hopefully you've gotten some practice now. That is going to be negative 4. That is negative 4. And so now we have 3/7 plus negative 4/3. And so now we definitely need to find a common denominator. So let me rewrite this. This is equal to 3/7 plus, lemme write this, plus negative 4. Actually yeah, this is fine plus negative 4/3. Or I could write this as even negative 4/3, either way."
Math,"But if we wanna have a common denominator, it looks like 21 is going to be the least common multiple of 7 and 3. So let's rewrite each of these as something over 21, 3/7. To go from 7 to 21, you multiply by 3. So 3 times 3 is 9. And then to go from 3 to 21, we multiply by 7. So if we have negative 4 times 7, that is negative 28. And so this is going to be equal to 9 plus negative 28/21, which is, this is the same thing as 9 minus 28/21, 'cause subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its opposite."
Math,"And so this gets us, let's see if 9 minus 9 is 0 and then we're gonna have 19 more to go below 0. So this is negative 19/21 or we could write that as negative 19/21. And we are done.."
Math,"Well, the thing that jumps out at you is that these are in different formats. This is a percentage. These are different representations. There's a percentage. This is a decimal. This is a mixed number. And so to make sense of it, it's probably a good idea to get them all in the same format. And it seems like we could get all of these into a decimal format pretty easily. So let's go that way. So 79%, that literally means 79 per 100. If you wanted to write it as a fraction, it would be 79/100."
Math,"But if you wanted to write it as a decimal, it's 0.79, which could be 0-- or we would write it down a 0.79. Now, 79.1 is already written as a decimal, so we'll just write it again. So minus 79.1. And then, 58 and 1/10. Well, 1/10 is the same thing as 0.1. So you could view this as 58-- well, and literally as 1/10. So it's minus 58 and 1/10. Or, you could view this as 58.1. So now they're all in the same format, let's actually do the computation."
Math,"Now, the first thing that jumps out at you is you have a fairly small number here. Small positive number. It's less than 1. And you're subtracting fairly large numbers over here. So your whole answer is going to be negative. And to make sense of this a little bit, what I'm going to do is I'm going to factor out a negative sign. And that'll make the computation-- at least in my brain, it's going to make it a little bit easier."
Math,"So if we factor out a negative sign, this becomes-- so we're going to factor it out. Actually, let me just do it this way. So if we factor out a negative sign, then this will become negative. This would be positive. And this would be positive. And just to verify this, imagine distributing this negative sign, or if this was a negative 1. Negative 1 times this is positive. Negative 1 times this is negative. Negative 1 times this is negative. So these two expressions are the exact same thing."
Math,"And the reason why I did that is now we'll do the more natural thing of we will add these two numbers. We'll get a positive number, a larger positive number than what we're going to subtract from it right over here. So we can use our traditional method. Although, we can't forget about this negative out here. So let's first do that. Let's add 79.1 plus 58.1. So 79.1 plus 58.1. So 0.1 plus a 0.1 is 0.2. 9 plus 8 is 17. So that's seven 1's and one 10. So one 10 plus seven 10's is going to get us to 0.8."
Math,"Plus 0.5 gets us to thirteen 10's, or 130. So we have 137.2 is this part right over here. So 100. Let me write this down. So we have 137.2. And then from that, adding a negative 0.79 is equivalent of subtracting 0.79. So let's do that. Let's subtract 0.79, making a point to align our decimal points so that we're subtracting the right place from the right place. And now let's do our subtraction. So right now we're subtracting 9 from nothing."
Math,"We could write a 0 right over here, but we still face an issue in the hundredths place. We're also subtracting a 0.7 from 0.2. So we're going to have to regroup a little bit in the numerator in order to subtract. Or at least, in order to subtract using the most traditional technique. So let's take a tenth from the 2, so it's only one tenth now, and give it to the hundredths. So one tenth is ten hundredths. So we could subtract that ten hundredths minus nine hundredths is one hundredth."
Math,"Now in the tenths place. We don't have enough up here, so let's take 1 from the one's place. So that becomes a 6. 1 is ten tenths. So now we have 11 tenths. 11 minus 7 is 4. Add our decimal place. 6 minus 0 is 6. And then we got our 13 just like that. So outside the parentheses, I still have the negative sign. When I computed all of this inside the parentheses, I got 136.41. And then we can't forget about the negative sign out here. So this whole thing computes to negative 136.41.."
Math,"Here it's a decimal, here we have two fractions, and then here we have a percentage. So the easiest thing to do would be to write all of these in the same format. And for me, the easiest format to do this computation in would be to write them all as fractions. And the reason why I want to do that, in particular, is because 4/3, when you divide by 3, when you divide 1/3, 2/3, 4/3, you're going to have a repeating decimal."
Math,"So to avoid that, I want to put all of these-- I want to rewrite all of these as fractions. So let's do them one at a time. So 0.79, this is the same thing as 79/100, so I'll just write it that way. So this is the same thing as 79 over 100. Then of course, we have minus 4/3. Then we have minus 1/2. And then finally, we have-- I don't want to run out of colors here. Finally we have 150%. Well, 150%, percent literally means per cent, per hundred. So this is plus 150 per 100."
Math,"So now we've written them all as fractions. And in order to do all the subtraction and addition, we have to find a common denominator. So what's the least common multiple of 100, 3, 2, and 100? Well, 100 is divisible by 2, so 100 is actually the least common multiple of 102. So we really have to just find the least common multiple between 100 and 300. And that's just going to be 300. There's no other common factors between 100 and 3. So let's write all of them with 300 as the common denominator."
Math,"So let me do this in this reddish color. So 79 over 100 is the same thing. If I were to write it over 300, to go from 100 to 300 in the denominator, I'm multiplying by 3, so I have to multiply the numerator by 3 as well. So I'm going to multiply it by 3 as well. Let's see, 80 times 3 would be 240. So it's going to be 3 less than that. So 240 minus 3 is 237. Now 4/3. Well, to get the denominator to be 300, we have to multiply the denominator by 100, so we have to multiply the numerator by 100 as well."
Math,"1/2, if our denominator is 300, we multiplied the denominator by 150 to go from 200 to 300, so we have to multiply the numerator by 150. And then finally, 150 over 100, well, we're multiplying the denominator by 3 to get to 300, to go from 100 to 300. So we have to do the same thing in the numerator. So 3 times 150 is 450. So now we have the same denominator, and we can now add our numerators. So this is going to be equal to-- actually, I could just do it right over here on the right-hand side."
Math,"This is going to be equal to some stuff over 300. So it's going to be 237 minus 400 and minus 150 and-- this actually should be a plus right over here. This should be plus 450. And so let's see if we could simplify this a little bit. We're subtracting 400, and we're subtracting 150. So these two would be the same thing as subtracting 550. And then we have a positive 237, and we're adding it to a positive 450."
Math,"Or actually, maybe another easier way to think about this is negative 550 plus 450 is going to get us negative 100. And so this simplifies things a good bit. Now we have 237 minus 100 is going to be 137. So it equals 137 in the numerator over 300. And this is about as simplified as I can think of making it. And so this is our final answer, 137/300.."
Math,"It lost another two yards on the following play. Lina wants to know what her team's net change in field position was after these three plays. Which of the following equations matches the situation above? So, let's think about it. The team she was cheering for, first they gained six yards. So that's positive six yards. Then they lost eight. So it'd be six minus eight. And then it lost another two. So, six minus eight minus two. This is six minus eight but then plus two. So, this isn't right."
Math,"This is six plus negative eight which is equivalent to six minus eight, plus negative two. So, this would be equivalent to six minus eight minus two. Or another way to think about it, they gained six yards. Then they lost eight yards. And then they lost another two yards. So, definitely go with that one. Let's keep going. Eddie and Fran are scuba diving. Eddie is 35 meters below the surface of the water, and Fran is eight meters directly above him."
Math,"The following situation describes this, or the following equation describes this situation. So let's see, Eddie is 35 meters below the surface of the water. So, when we're below the surface, or the more below the surface we are, the more negative, I guess is what we're doing here. So, if we're at the surface of the water, you would be at zero meters. And they tell us Fran is eight meters above him. So we're taking Eddie's depth at 35 meters and then Fran is eight meters above."
Math,"So, we're adding eight, to figure out Fran's depth of negative 27 meters. Notice, this is eight meters above Eddie's depth. So, negative 27 is Fran's depth. She is 27 meters below the surface of the water. So, select all that apply. Fran is 27 meters below the surface of the water. Yeah, that's what we just talked about. If your depth is, or I guess you could say, if you're at negative 27 that means 27 meters below the water. If you were at positive 27, that means you're at 27 meters above the water."
Math,"So that's what they're telling us. Fran's position relative to the surface of the water is negative 27 meters. Yeah, I think that's a reasonable way to say it. It's a little bit more confusing. But, yeah, she is negative 27 meters below the surface of the water which we just said up here. So I think that's fair enough to say that as well. Let's do one more. Fred's basement is flooded. The basement floor is 3.4 meters below the ground floor."
Math,"Alright, that makes sense that the basement is below the ground, 3.4 meters. The water is 1.2 meters high. The following equation describes this situation. So negative 3.4, that's where the floor of the basement is. It is 3.4 meters below the ground floor. So the ground floor would be zero. So, it's 3.4 meters below the ground floor. So, that's the negative 3.4. But then the water is 1.2 meters. The top of, the surface of the water, is 1.2 meters above the floor of the basement."
Math,"So this negative 2.2 is how high the top of the water is. So, what does negative 2.2 tell us? Well, the top of the water is 2.2 meters below the ground floor. Yep, that's right. The water's 1.2 meters above the floor of the basement which is negative 2.2 meters. And this is all relative to the ground floor. So if the ground floor was zero, the top of the water is negative 2.2, which means the top of the water is 2.2 meters below, that's what the negative tells us, below the ground floor."
Math,"The water is 2.2 meters deep. No, that's not right. They tell us that the water is 1.2 meters high or 1.2 meters deep. So, that's not right. And we're not going to click None of the above because we definitely found, we found an answer.."
Math,"Now, what I'll do is I'll plot them on a number line. But I'm going to plot it on a vertical number line that has a resemblance to a thermometer, since we're talking about temperature. So I'm going to make my number line vertical right over here. So there's my little vertical number line. And this right over here is 0 degrees Fahrenheit, which really is of no significance. If it was Celsius, we'd be talking about the freezing point. But for Fahrenheit, that happens at 32 degrees."
Math,But let's say this is 0 degrees Fahrenheit. And let's plot these two points. So one of the coldest ever recorded temperatures was negative 128 degrees Fahrenheit. So let's say that's right over here. This is negative 128 degrees Fahrenheit. And one of the warmest temperatures ever recorded was 134 degrees. This is a positive 134. So it's about that far and a little bit further. So it's a positive 134 degrees Fahrenheit.
Math,"So when they're asking us how many degrees difference are there between the coldest and the warmest, they're essentially saying, well, what is this distance between the coldest and the warmest right over here? What is this distance? And there's a couple of ways you could think about it."
Math,"You could say, hey, if I started at the coldest temperature and I wanted to go all the way up to the warmest, how much would I have to add? Or you could say, well, what's the difference between the coldest and the warmest? So you could take the larger number. So it's, say, 134. And from that, you could subtract the smaller number, which is negative 128."
Math,"So this essentially saying what's the difference between these two numbers? It's going to be positive, because we're subtracting the smaller one from the larger one. This is going to give you the exact same thing as this. Now, there's several ways to think about it. One is we know that if you subtract a negative number, that's the same thing as adding the positive of that number, or adding the absolute value. So this is the same thing. This is going to be equal to 134 plus positive 128 degrees."
Math,"And what's the intuition behind that? Why does this happen? Well, look at this right over here. We're trying to figure out this distance. This distance is 134 minus negative 128. And if you look at that, it's going to be the absolute value of 134. It's going to be this distance right over here, which is just 134-- which is just that right over there-- plus this distance right over here. Now, what is this distance? Well, it's the absolute value of negative 128. It's just 128."
Math,"So it's going to be that distance, 134, plus 128. And that's why it made sense. This way, you're thinking of what's the difference between a larger number and a smaller number. But since it's a smaller number and you're subtracting a negative, it's the same thing as adding a positive. And hopefully this gives you a little bit of that intuition. But needless to say, we can now figure out what's going to be. And this is going to be equal to-- let me figure this out separately over here."
Math,"So if I were to add 134 plus 128, I get 4 plus 8 is 12, 1 plus 3 plus 2 is 6. It's 262. This right over here is equal to 262. How many degrees difference are there between the coldest and warmest recorded outside temperature? 262 degrees Fahrenheit difference.."
Math,"Amanda notices the temperature at 5pm is negative nine degrees Celsius. What was the temperature in Fairbanks at 3pm? So they're essentially telling us the temperature at the end of these changes, and they want us to figure out the temperature at the beginning of these changes. So let's see if we can do that. Let me draw. Since, in thermometers we're used to thinking vertically. So I'll draw a vertical number line here to think about this a little bit. So here we go."
Math,"Alright, so at 5pm we end up at negative nine degrees Celsius, so let's just say this is zero, negative one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So we end up at negative nine degrees Celsius. This is zero degrees Celsius right over here. So from zero... Sorry, from 4pm to 5pm the temperature dropped by five degrees Celsius and that got us to negative nine. So we drop by five to get to negative nine, so we must've started five above negative nine. So one, two, three, four, five..."
Math,"Right over here. So this is that drop. This is that five degree drop. Like we said, one, two, three, four, five. So that's that five degree drop right over here. This is a negative five degrees Celsius. So at 4pm, right at 4pm, we must've had a temperature of... Well, five above negative nine is going to be negative four. Negative four degrees Celsius. This is what the temperature was at 4pm. So this is at 4pm."
Math,"And then, to figure out 3pm, remember when we go from 3pm to 4pm our temperature increased two degrees Celsius. So we increased by two degrees Celsius from that hour to get to negative four degrees Celsius. So we increased by two degrees Celsius. So if we increase by two degrees Celsius to get to negative four, that means at 3pm we must've been two below that. So this is what we did from three to four. >From three to four we increased by two to get to negative four."
Math,"So this right over here is the plus two degrees Celsius right over there. So we must've started right here at 3pm. We must've started right there at 3pm. All I did is underline this. If you know we're at negative nine to end with, and from four to five we dropped negative five to get there, that means at four we must've been five above negative nine."
Math,"So we're at negative four, and then from three to four, if we increased two degrees to get there, that means at three we must've been two degrees below negative four. So this right over here is negative six degrees Celsius. So what was the temperature in Fairbanks at 3pm? It was negative six degrees Celsius. And you can verify that. If you start at negative six, you add two, you get to negative four, and then you subtract five, you get to negative nine, which is exactly what we had here.."
Math,"I'm, I have a negative five here and then I have a positive five. You might be tempted to say, ""Well, maybe I could change the order of, that I'm adding and subtracting things."" Well, if we were just adding a bunch of numbers you could change the order. For example, we know that nine plus seven is equal to 16, and if I just change the order the commutative property tells us, well, seven plus nine, it applies to addition."
Math,"If I swap the order here it's still going to be equal to 16, but that's not true if I do nine minus seven or seven minus nine. If I change the order, I'm not getting the same result. The commutative property does not apply to subtraction. This top expression is positive two. This bottom expression is negative two. So I can't just use the commutative property here to change the order with which I'm adding and subtracting because I have subtraction here."
Math,"But what if I could rewrite this expression, so it only involves addition? ""How can you do that, Sal?"" You are probably thinking. And the key realization is when you subtract a number it's the same thing as adding the opposite. For example, if I have six minus three, that is the same thing as adding the opposite of positive three, which is negative three. Or if I had six minus negative three, subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its opposite."
Math,"So what I could do is all of these places where I'm subtracting a number, instead I could just rewrite it so I'm adding the opposite. So let me do that. So I can rewrite this expression as negative 5 plus 13. So far, I'm only adding. Here, I'm subtracting all of a sudden. Minus 21, subtracting a number. Well, I can rewrite that as adding its opposite. So subtracting, lemme just another color. Subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its opposite. All right, let me keep going."
Math,"Then I'm adding a five. Remember, I'm just trying to make this, so I'm just adding a bunch of things instead of adding and subtracting. I have the plus 21. Now again, I am subtracting a number, so I can rewrite that as adding, I'm subtracting a positive 13. I can rewrite that as adding a negative 13. And then last but not least, over here I am subtracting again. I'm subtracting a number, so I can rewrite that as adding the opposite of this number. So I'm now adding positive 11."
Math,"Subtracting negative 11 is the same thing as adding positive 11. Now, why did I do this? Well, now I can use a commutative property. All I'm doing is I'm adding a bunch of numbers now so I can swap the order in with, with which I add. So I could now rewrite it. Let's see, I have a negative five, and now let me add this positive five next. So add the positive five, and then I have, I'm adding a positive 13, and to that I can add the negative 13."
Math,"Remember, the only reason why I can now swap the order is 'cause I'm only adding a bunch of integers. Next, I have this negative 21. So let me circle that. I'm adding a negative 21, adding negative 21, and then I could add the positive 21, which is right over there. And then last but not least, I add 11. Now, why was all of this super useful? Well, now look what happens. Things start to simplify a lot."
Math,"Not only when I'm doing addition can I use a commutative property, can I change the order, but I can also use the associative property very easily. So I could start to say, all right, let me add these two first and I could also add these two. I can pair these up, and that's useful because these cancel out with each other. They're opposites. If I take a negative five plus a positive five, that's a zero. A 13 plus a negative 13, that's a zero. A negative 21 plus 21, that's a zero."
Math,"And so what am I left with? I am just left with a positive 11. So hopefully you see that if I can rewrite subtraction as adding the opposite, I can now use the commutative and the associative properties to really simplify things which is really useful the rest of your mathematical careers. I encourage you in your own time, go left to right with this original expression and you'll see that you get this exact same result. It's just going to actually take you a lot more time.."
Math,"So pause this video and see if you can have a go at it before we do this together. All right, now let's look through the choices. So this first choice, we have 9.4. Here we subtracted 9.4. Now when you subtract a number, you can also view it as adding its opposite. So we could rewrite this top thing as two plus negative 9.4. Notice when we subtract 9.4, that's the same thing as adding negative 9.4 so we could write it this way."
Math,"And when you are adding numbers, and that's actually this property or this principle that we just used, it's really useful because when you're adding numbers like this, it doesn't matter what order you add them in. When you have some subtraction involved, now all of a sudden the order does matter. But when you're adding like this, it doesn't matter the order that you are doing it with. So we can swap these numbers any way we want. We could write this, for example, as negative 9.4 plus two plus 3.71."
Math,"We could ignore the zero or put that anywhere obviously. Plus zero, something like that. But what we see over here, they don't have a negative 9.4. They have a positive 9.4. So I really don't know how I can reconcile this first thing in this right over here, so I'm gonna rule that one out. Now this one over here, you have a two. We have a two there. We have a 3.71. We have a 3.71 there and both of those things are just being added. And now we have a, and now from that we are subtracting 9.4."
Math,"And so here they are subtracting 9.4 and it is indeed the case here, you have to be very careful with subtraction if, we wouldn't wanna make it 9.4 minus something else. But as long as we're only subtracting the 9.4, then the swapping of this order does work and you could even verify that with the numbers over here. You could do two minus 9.4 plus 3.71 or you could do two plus 3.71 minus 9.4. So I like this choice. Now let's look at this one. This has 3.71, 3.71."
Math,"It has the two, it has the two, and now it's adding 9.4. Now we already said we could rewrite subtracting 9.4 as adding negative 9.4, but we can't rewrite that as just adding 9.4. If this was like this, if it had a negative there, then this would work, but it's not that. And so I'm going to rule that one out and I'm guessing this one's going to work, but let's see. So this one put parentheses around it, so it's really just telling us what we want to do first."
Math,"So it says first do the two minus 9.4 which if you just went left to right, you would've done anyway. And then plus zero plus 3.71 and zero plus 3.71, obviously that's just going to be 3.71. So of course, this does seem very reasonable to do. That you could go two minus 9.4 plus 3.71. Two minus 9.4, the zero doesn't matter here, and then plus 3.71. So I like that choice. Let's do another example. So once again, we wanna come up with an equivalent with equivalent expressions, so let's look at this one."
Math,"Actually before I even look at the choices, let's just recognize that if you subtract a number, it's the same thing as adding its opposite. So for example, this could be rewritten as negative 6/5 plus 1/2 plus the opposite of negative 8/5 which is positive 8/5. That's another way we could rewrite it. That might be helpful. Let's see, over here we have 1/2 which we see right over there."
Math,"We have plus 8/5 and interestingly that looks like the one that we did in the second version right over here, and then we have minus 6/5. So is minus 6/5 the same thing as this over here? Well, let's think about it. What we're really doing when we write this negative 6/5 out front, that's the same thing as, we could do that as plus negative 6/5 and that's going to be the same thing as subtracting the opposite of it. Or another way of thinking about it is subtracting positive 6/5."
Math,"Let me write it this way, subtracting positive 6/5. It's actually hard to tell because I put that I have, actually let me write it this way. If we just took this version and if we were to use a commutative property to swap the orders, we could write this as 1/5 plus 8/5 and then plus negative 6/5. All I did is swap the order and now we know that this last part could be rewritten. So it's 1/5 plus 8/5. Instead of plus negative 6/5, that can be rewritten as negative or minus I should say, minus positive 6/5."
Math,"Why can I do that? Because subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its opposite. And so all of these are equivalent and this is exactly what they have written here, this last scenario. So I like that one. Now let's see, this one has a negative 6/5 and it has a plus 8/5 and a plus 1/2. So all they did is they took this version which we knew is equivalent and they swapped the order that we are doing. They actually swapped the order of the 1/2 and the 8/5."
Math,"And when you're dealing with addition like this, you can move things around, the commutative property. You can do your addition in different orders and that's all they're doing. Actually this is not just commutative, this is also associative. They're literally putting that parentheses there and say hey, let's just do, and let's just do the those first two first. Let's swap these two and then of course, even if you're going left to right, you would do these first two even if the parentheses weren't there."
Math,"So all of this is definitely equivalent to negative 6/5, swapping the 1/2 and the 8/5. So 8/5 plus 1/2. So I like that choice too. And so we had two choices, so these are probably not going to work and let's see why they don't real fast. They both have the negative 6/5. This has the plus 1/2, but it has minus 8/5 instead of minus negative 8/5. It could have plus 8/5 here, but not minus 8/5. So we rule that one out. Negative 6/5, and let's see."
Math,"Then it's adding negative 8/5 instead of subtracting negative 8/5. So I don't like that, and then it subtracts 1/2 instead of adding 1/2, so it's no good on multiple dimensions. Let's do one last example. Which of the expressions are equivalent? As always pause and see if you can figure that out. So let's see, so actually before I look at the choices, I'm gonna see if there's different ways to rewrite this. We could rewrite this as 1.7 minus 8.33."
Math,"Why can I do that again? Because subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its opposite, and then I could say plus. I could write this as 8.33 and if I wanted to I could even write this, instead of minus 1.95, I could even write that as plus negative 1.95 if I choose 'cause once again, subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its opposite."
Math,"Now I'm tempted to try to compute this because we could just, when we're doing addition like this and I could write it like this if I want everything to be addition. 1.7 plus negative 8.33 plus 8.33 plus negative 1.95. When everything is expressed in addition, we know that the order doesn't matter. The commutative property tells us that. And even the associative property tells us how we put the parentheses doesn't matter, and so we could actually do that first and though these two would cancel out."
Math,"Actually maybe we will have to do that. That choice looks like that, but let's just go step by step. So this has 1.7 and 1.7. Let me do this in a different color. One point, that's not a different color. 1.7, 1.7, they're subtracting 8.33. That's subtracting 8.33 here, so that's equivalent to this version right here. Then they're subtracting it again. No, this does not look good because even when we try to compute it, we know that these two terms will cancel out each other, so I don't like that one."
Math,"Let's see, this one. If we take this one here and we were to reorder it because this is all addition of different integers here, but if we were to reorder it, we could reorder it as negative 8.33, negative 8.33, plus 8.33, plus 8.33, plus 1.7, plus 1.7, and then we have plus negative 1.95 which we know we can write as minus 1.95, minus 1.95, because subtracting a number is the same thing as adding its opposite, and that's what they have here. They put these parentheses."
Math,"But if you just went left to right, I should say, with this one, you're going to get the same thing. So I like that choice there. Now this choice, if you just canceled these two terms out, you're left with a 1.7 plus negative 1.95 which we already know is the same thing as minus 1.95, so I like this choice as well. Now why won't this one work? Let's see, 1.95. They're trying to change the order, but you can add a negative 1.95 and then put it out front."
Math,"But this is a positive 1.95, so I'm already not liking this. And then they're subtracting 1.7. There's no reason why you should subtract 1.7, so this is definitely not looking good.."
Math,"with the intuition of adding negative three repeatedly five times, now look above above us slightly higher so you can see ideas of multiplying two negatives, but we can do the exact same product experiment. We want whatever this answer to be consistent with the rest of mathematics that we know so we can do the same product experiment. What would negative two times six plus negative six to be equal to. Well, six plus negative six is going to be zero."
Math,"Negative two times zero, anything times zero, needs to be equal to zero, but then once again, we can distribute negative two times six so we get negative two times six, then plus negative two times negative six plus negative two times negative six, then once again all of this is going to be equal to zero, now based on the five experiment we just did, we said ""well this needs to be equal to negative twelve"" or we can view this as going to the six twice left direction on the number line which gets us to negative twelve or you could say repeatedly adding negative twos times six would also get you to negative twelve and now we also saw over here we want to multiply a positive and a negative we got the negative so this could be, you know, going to be equal to negative twelve so we have negative twelve plus whatever this business is going to have to be equal to zero (repeated) in order to be consistent with all the other mathematics that we know and so what plus negative twelve is going to equal to be zero Well, positive twelve plus negative twelve is going to equal to zero so this needs to be equal to positive twelve in order to be consistent with all the other mathematics we know so there we get the idea that this is going positive twelve."
Math,I'll leave you there and I'll see if I can make a few other videos that can also give you a conceptual understanding of why these are true.
Math,"Now, let's mix it up a little bit, introduce some negative numbers. So what happens if I had negative 2 times 3? Well, one way to think about, and we'll talk more about the intuition in this video and in future videos, is, well, you could view this as negative 2 repeatedly added three times. So this could be negative 2 plus negative 2 plus negative 2-- not negative 6-- plus negative 2, which would be equal to-- well, negative 2 plus negative 2 is negative 4 plus another negative 2 is negative 6."
Math,"So this would be equal to negative 6. Or another way to think about it is if I had 2 times 3, I would get 6. But because one of these two numbers is negative, then my product is going to be negative. So if I multiply a negative times a positive, I'm going to get a negative. Now, what if we swap the order in which we multiply? So if we were to multiply 3 times negative 2. Well, it shouldn't matter. The order in which we multiply things shouldn't change the product."
Math,"Whether we multiply 2 times 3, we'll get 6, or if we multiply 3 times 2, we'll get 6. And so we should have the same property here. 3 times negative 2 should give us the same result. It's going to be equal to negative 6. And once again, we say 3 times 2 would be 6. One of these two numbers is negative. And so our product is going to be negative. So we could write a positive times a negative is also going to be a negative."
Math,"And both of these are just the same thing with the order in which we're multiplying switched around. But this is one of the two numbers are negative, exactly one. So one negative, one positive number is being multiplied. Then you will get a negative product. Now let's think about the third circumstance when both of the numbers are negative. I'll just switch colors for fun here. If I were to multiply negative 2 times negative 3-- and this might be the least intuitive for you of all."
Math,"And here I'm just going to introduce you to the rule. And in future videos, we'll explore why this is and why this makes mathematics more all fit together. But this is going to be, you say, well, 2 times 3 would be 6, and I have a negative times a negative. And one way you can think about it is that the negatives cancel out. And so you will actually end up with a positive 6. I actually don't have to write a positive here, but I'll write it here just to reemphasize. This right over here is a positive 6."
Math,"So we have another rule of thumb here. If I have a negative times a negative, the negatives are going to cancel out. And that's going to give me a positive number. Now, with these out of the way, let's just do a bunch of examples. I encourage you to try them out before I do them. Pause the video, try them out, and see if you get the same answer. So let's try negative 1 times negative 1. Well, 1 times 1 would be 1, and we have a negative times a negative. They cancel out."
Math,"Negative times a negative give me a positive, so this is going to be positive 1. I could just write 1, or I could literally write a plus sign there to emphasize that this is a positive 1. What happens if I did negative 1 times 0? Now, this might say, wait, this doesn't really fit into any of these circumstances. 0 is neither positive nor negative. And here you just have to remember anything times 0 is going to be 0. So negative 1 times 0 is going to be 0."
Math,"Or I could have said 0 times negative 783, that is also going to be 0. Let me do some interesting ones. What about-- I'll pick a new color-- 12 times negative 4? Well, once again, 12 times positive 4 would be 48. And we're in the circumstance where one of these two numbers right over here is negative, this one right over here. If exactly one of the two numbers is negative, then the product is going to be negative. We are in this circumstance right over here."
Math,"We have one negative, so the product is negative. You could imagine this as repeatedly adding negative 4 twelve times. And so you would get to negative 48. Let's do another one. What is 7 times 3? Well, this is a bit of a trick. There are no negative numbers here. This is just going to be 7 times 3, positive 7 times positive 3, the first circumstance, which you already knew how to do before this video. This would just be equal to 21. Let's do one more."
Math,"So if I were to say negative 5 times negative 10, well, once again, negative times a negative, the negatives cancel out. Then you're just left with a positive product. So it's going to be 5 times 10. It's going to be 50. The negative and the negatives cancel out. Your product is going to be positive. That's this situation right over there.."
Math,"or the other, but not both, you'll get a negative answer. And if both are negative, they'll cancel out and you'll get a positive answer. But let's apply and I encourage you to pause this video and try these out yourself and then see if you get the same answer that I'm going to get. So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2)."
Math,"So if I just said eight (8) divided by two (2), that would be a positive four (4), but since exactly one of these two numbers are negative, this one right over here, the answer is going to be negative. So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2) is negative four (-4). Now negative sixteen (-16) divided by positive four (4)-- now be very careful here. If I just said positive sixteen (16) divided by positive four (4), that would just be four (4)."
Math,"But because one of these two numbers is negative, and exactly one of these two numbers is negative, then I'm going to get a negative answer. Now I have negative thirty (-30) divided by negative five (-5). If I just said thirty (30) divided by five (5), I'd get a positive six (6). And because I have a negative divided by a negative, the negatives cancel out, so my answer will still be positive six (6)! And I could even write a positive (+) out there, I don't have to, but this is a positive six (6)."
Math,"A negative divided by a negative, just like a negative times a negative, you're gonna get a positive answer. Eighteen (18) divided by two (2)! And this is a little bit of a trick question. This is what you knew how to do before we even talked about negative numbers: This is a positive divided by a positive. Which is going to be a positive. So that is going to be equal to positive nine (9). Now we start doing some interesting things, here's kind of a compound problem."
Math,"We have some multiplication and some division going on. And so first right over here, the way this is written, we're gonna wanna multiply the numerator out, and if you're not familiar with this little dot symbol, it's just another way of writing multiplication. I could've written this little ""x"" thing over here but what you're gonna see in Algebra is that the dot become much more common."
Math,"Because the X becomes used for other-- People don't want to confuse it with the letter X which gets used a lot in Algebra. That's why they used the dot very often. So this just says negative seven (-7) times three (3) in the numerator, and we're gonna take that product and divide it by negative one (-1)."
Math,"So the numerator, negative seven (-7) times three (3), positive seven (7) times three (3) would be twenty-one (21), but since exactly one of these two are negative, this is going to be negative twenty-one (-21), that's gonna be negative twenty-one (-21) over negative one (-1). And so negative twenty-one (-21) divided by negative one (-1), negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive. So this is going to be a positive twenty-one (21). Let me write all these things down."
Math,"So if I were to take a positive divided by a negative, that's going to be a negative. If I had a negative divided by a positive, that's also going to be a negative. If I have a negative divided by a negative, that's going to give me a positive, and if obviously a positive divided by a positive, that's also going to give me a positive. Now let's do this last one over here. This is actually all multiplication, but it's interesting, because we're multiplying three (3) things, which we haven't done yet."
Math,"And we could just go from left to right over here, and we could first think about negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7). Negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7). They are both negatives, and negatives cancel out, so this would give us, this part right over here, will give us positive fourteen (14). And so we're going to multiply positive fourteen (14) times this negative one (-1), times -1. Now we have a positive times a negative."
Math,"Exactly one of them is negative, so this is going to be negative answer, it's gonna give me negative fourteen (-14). Now let me give you a couple of more, I guess we could call these trick problems. What would happen if I had zero (0) divided by negative five (-5). Well this is zero negative fifths So zero divided by anything that's non-zero is just going to equal to zero."
Math,"But what if it were the other way around? What happens if we said negative five divided by zero? Well, we don't know what happens when you divide things by zero. We haven't defined that. There's arguments for multiple ways to conceptualize this, so we traditionally do say that this is undefined. We haven't defined what happens when something is divided by zero. And similarly, even when we had zero divided by zero, this is still, this is still, undefined.."
Math,"What I want to do in this video is just make sure we have a decent understanding how to manipulate negative signs when we see them in fractions. For example, if I have the fraction negative 1/2. Here I have the negative out in front of the entire 1/2. This is the same thing as negative one over two. And it's going to be the same thing as one over negative two. Now I could also think about something like negative one over negative two."
Math,"Now it's important to realize one way to think about this as a fraction is you could view this as negative one divided by negative two. And we already know, if you divide a negative by a negative it would be a positive. So this right over here is going to be the same thing as 1/2. This is going to be the same thing as positive 1/2. Now with that out of the way, let's think a little bit. Let's do some example problems that might push our thinking on this a little bit more. So this first question."
Math,"Which of the following expressions are equivalent to negative g over h? Negative G over H. Select all that apply. All right, so this has all sorts of negatives here. So at first it looks a little bit unusual. But then we need to just realize that this part. Actually, let me just square this off in blue right over here. Negative g over negative h. We've already figured that out. We actually looked at that right over here."
Math,"If you have a negative divided by a negative, that's the same thing as a positive value divided by the positive value. So negative g over negative h, is the same thing as g over h. And then you still have this negative out front. You still have that negative out front. So this one right over here is actually equal to negative g over h. When we think about it, negative divided by a negative is a positive and you still have this negative out here. So that's the same thing."
Math,"And this right over here, negative in front. And then you have g over negative h. This is going to be the same thing. You could rewrite this, you could put the negative on top as negative g over negative h. And then this would be equal to g over h, which is different. This is positive g over h. This is negative g over h. So we wouldn't select that. And of course we wouldn't select ""None of the above."" Cause we found a choice that we liked. All right."
Math,"Which of the following expressions are equivalent to five over b. Select all that apply. All right, so this one over here. Negative five over negative b. Well we could remember that this negative, we could write this is the same thing as negative five over negative b. And I just want to make it clear we're that negative. So this is negative Instead of writing it negative in front of the entire fraction, I could essentially multiply the negative one times just the numerator."
Math,"So you could write this as negative five over negative b. And negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive. So this actually is going to be equal to positive five over b, which is what we're looking for. So this is going to be right. Now this one, negative divided by a negative, well that's just going to be positive. So that's the same thing as five over b. One way to think about it is that well the negatives kind of cancel each other out. So five over b, that looks good too."
Math,"And of course I won't select none of the above because I found two choices that worked. All right, let's do one more. Which of the following expressions are equal to negative e over negative f? And remember we just have to take this step by step here. Actually let's try to just simplify this directly. So negative e over negative f. Well we just need to remind ourselves that this part right over here. Negative e over negative f. Let me write an equal sign. Negative e over, and I'm gonna put this negative."
Math,"Let me do this in a different color. Let me do this in purple. So we have this purple. So we have that purple negative right over there. And negative e over negative f. We've already talked about this multiple times. That's the same thing as negative's divided by a negative is a positive. That's the same thing as e over f, as positive e over f. So this whole thing will simplify to negative e over f. So let's see which of these choices are that. Well this right here is positive e over f."
Math,So that's not the choice. This one over here. This one we could write it several ways actually. We could write it negative negative e over f. Which of course is equal to positive e over f. We could also write this. We could put the negative in the denominator. We could say that this thing. Actually let me write it over here as negative e over negative f. This is also a legitimate thing to do. You could take this negative and multiply it times the denominator. Right over here.
Math,"But either way it's going to be equal to positive e over f. These two are actually evaluate to the same expression. So here, I would select. Finally, I would select. I've been waiting to select ""None of the above."" All right, hopefully that helps.."
Math,"I have 1/9, and I'm going to add to that 5/9. So how many ninths am I going to have? Well, I had 1/9, now I'm adding 5/9, so I'm going to have 6/9. If I have one of something and I have five more of that same something-- so in this case, that something is a ninth-- 1/9 plus 5/9 is 6/9. Now, can we simplify this in any way? Well, both six and nine are divisible by 3, so let's divide them both by 3 to try to get this fraction in a simpler 6 divided by 3 is 2. 9 divided by 3 is 3."
Math,"So this is 2/3, while what we're trying to get to is negative 2/3. So these are not equal. This expression does not equal negative 2/3, so I'll write ""no"" for that one. Now let's go to this green expression right over here. Give myself a little bit more real estate to work in. Now, we have negative 1/6 plus negative 1/2. Now, we can view this as being the same thing as-- just to clarify, right now the negative is in front of the entire 1/6, the negative's in front of the entire 1/2."
Math,"But this is the same thing as negative 1/6, plus negative 1/2. Negative 1/2 is the same thing as negative 1 divided by 2 is one way to think about it. And the whole reason why I did this is so we can simplify what the negatives are right now only in our numerator. So whenever we add two fractions, we want to have the same denominator. And we see that 6 is already a multiple of 2, so we could leave this first fraction the way it is. We can rewrite it as negative 1/6."
Math,"And then the second fraction, we can write it as something over 6. Well, to go from 2 to 6, we have to multiply by 3. So let's also multiply the numerator by 3, negative 1 times 3 is negative 3. So if I have negative 1/6 sixth and I add to that negative 3/6, this is going to be negative 1 plus negative 3 sixths, which is equal to negative 4/6. Now, let's see if we can simplify it. Both negative 4-- I guess we can say both four and six are divisible by 2, so let's divide them both by 2."
Math,"And in the numerator, we're left with negative 4 divided by 2 is negative 2. 6 divided by 2 is 3. Negative 2 divided by 3. Well, that's the same thing as negative 2/3, which is exactly what our goal value we're trying to get to. So, yes, this thing in green is equal to negative 2/3. Now let's go over here. So we have negative 1.3 times negative 2. Well, if you multiply a negative times a negative, we're going to get a positive, and we're going to get a positive 1/3 times 2."
Math,"So one way to think about this is going to be the same thing as one third times 2, which is the same thing. And there's a couple of ways to think about it. If you have 1/3 and now you're going to multiply it by 2, we now have 2/3. You now have 2/3. Another way to think about this is that this is the same thing as 2/3 times 2 over 1. And you know that when we multiply two fractions, so this time we've expressed the 2 as a fraction, we can multiply the numerators."
Math,"So it's 1 times 2 over the product of their denominators, 3 times 1, which is 2 over 3. So either way you look at it, this goes to positive 2/3. A negative times a negative is a positive. So it gets us to positive 2/3 not negative 2/3, so like this first one, no, it does not equal negative 2/3. Now let's look at this one. Negative 2/3 divided by one half. So when you divide by a fraction, so when you take negative 1/3, dividing-- let me write it this way."
Math,"So negative 1/3 divided by 1/2, this is the same thing as negative 1/3-- and let me color code it just so you see what I'm doing. So let me make that green color. Let me make this a blue color. So negative 1/3 divided by 1/2 half is the same thing as negative 1/3 times the reciprocal of 1/2, so times 2 over 1."
Math,"And what is this going to be equal to? Well, we could assume instead of just doing this as negative 1/3, we could do this as negative 1 divided by 3, that might help us keep track of the signs a little bit And let me actually write it that way, just to make it a little bit clearer. Let me write this as negative 1 divided by 3. So our numerator is now going to be negative 1 times 2. When you multiply two fractions, you just multiply the two numerators to get the new numerator, and it's over 3 times 1."
Math,"And you normally wouldn't have to do all these steps, but I'm just doing them to make sure you understand what's going on. And so this is going to be equal to negative 1 times 2 is negative 1. And 3 times 1 is positive 3. Negative 2 over 3? Well, that's the same thing as negative 2/3. So this one works out. It is equal to negative 2/3.."
Math,"This looks like an integer. But you just to remind yourself that the negative 7 can be rewritten as negative 7/1 times 3/49. Now we can multiply the numerators. So the numerator is going to be negative 7 times 3. And the denominator is going to be 1 times 49. 1 times 49. And this is going to be equal to-- 7 times 3 is 21. And one of their signs is negative, so a negative times a positive is going to be a negative. So this is going to be negative 21."
Math,"You could view this as negative 7 plus negative 7 plus negative 7. And that's going to be over 49. And this is the correct value, but we can simplify it more because 21 and 49 both share 7 as a factor. That's their greatest common factor. So let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 7. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 7. And so this gets us negative 3 in the numerator. And in the denominator, we have 7. So we could view it as negative 3 over 7."
Math,"Or, you could even do it as negative 3/7. Let's do another one. Let's take 5/9 times-- I'll switch colors more in this one. That one's a little monotonous going all red there. 5/9 times 3/15. So this is going to be equal to-- we multiply the numerators. So it's going to be 5 times 3. 5 times 3 in the numerator. And the denominator is going to be 9 times 15. 9 times 15."
Math,"We could multiply them out, but just leaving it like this you see that there is already common factors in the numerator and the denominator. Both the numerator and the denominator, they're both divisible by 5 and they're both divisible by 3, which essentially tells us that they're divisible by 15. So we can divide the numerator and denominator by 15. So divide the numerator by 15, which is just like dividing by 5 and then dividing by 3. So we'll just divide by 15. Divide by 15."
Math,"And this is going to be equal to-- well, 5 times 3 is 15. Divided by 15 you get 1 in the numerator. And in the denominator, 9 times 15 divided by 15. Well, that's just going to be 9. So it's equal to 1/9. Let's do another one. What would negative 5/9 times negative 3/15 be? Well, we've already figured out what positive 5/9 times positive 3/15 would be. So now we just have to care about the sign. If we were just multiplying the two positives, it would be 1/9."
Math,"But now we have to think about the fact that we're multiplying by a negative times a negative. Now, we remember when you multiply a negative times a negative, it's a positive. The only way that you get a negative is if one of those two numbers that you're taking the product of is negative, not two. If both are positive, it's positive. If both are negative, it's positive. Let's do one more example. Let's take 5-- I'm using the number 5 a lot."
Math,"So let's do 3/2, just to show that this would work with improper fractions. 3/2 times negative 7/10. I'm arbitrarily picking colors. And so our numerator is going to be 3 times negative 7. 3 times negative 7. And our denominator is going to be 2 times 10. 2 times 10. So this is going to be the numerator. Positive times a negative is a negative. 3 times negative 7 is negative 21. Negative 21. And the denominator, 2 times 10. Well, that is just 20. So this is negative 21/20."
Math,And you really can't simplify this any further..
Math,"So this is going to be the exact same thing as negative 5/6 times the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. I'm just swapping the numerator and the denominator. So this is going to be 4/3. And we've already seen lots of examples multiplying fractions. This is going to be the numerators times each other. So we're going to multiply negative 5 times 4. I'll give the negative sign to the 5 there, so negative 5 times 4. Let me do 4 in that yellow color. And then the denominator is 6 times 3."
Math,"Now, in the numerator here, you see we have a negative number. You might already know that 5 times 4 is 20, and you just have to remember that we're multiplying a negative times a positive. We're essentially going to have negative 5 four times. So negative 5 plus negative 5 plus negative 5 plus negative 5 is negative 20. So the numerator here is negative 20. And the denominator here is 18. So we get 20/18, but we can simplify this. Both the numerator and the denominator, they're both divisible by 2."
Math,"So let's divide them both by 2. Let me give myself a little more space. So if we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2, just to simplify this-- and I picked 2 because that's the largest number that goes into both of these. It's the greatest common divisor of 20 and 18. 20 divided by 2 is 10, and 18 divided by 2 is 9. So negative 5/6 divided by 3/4 is-- oh, I have to be very careful here. It's negative 10/9, just how we always learned."
Math,"If you have a negative divided by a positive, if the signs are different, then you're going to get a negative value. Let's do another example. Let's say that I have negative 4 divided by negative 1/2. So using the exact logic that we just said, we say, hey look, dividing by something is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. So this is going to be equal to negative 4."
Math,"And instead of writing it as negative 4, let me just write it as a fraction so that we are clear what its numerator is and what its denominator is. So negative 4 is the exact same thing as negative 4/1. And we're going to multiply that times the reciprocal of negative 1/2. The reciprocal of negative 1/2 is negative 2/1. You could view it as negative 2/1, or you could view it as positive 2 over negative 1, or you could view it as negative 2. Either way, these are all the same value."
Math,"And now we're ready to multiply. Notice, all I did here, I rewrote the negative 4 just as negative 4/1. Negative 4 divided by 1 is negative 4. And here, for the negative 1/2, since I'm multiplying now, I'm multiplying by its reciprocal. I've swapped the denominator and the numerator. Or I swapped the denominator and the numerator. What was the denominator is now the numerator. What was the numerator is now the denominator. And I'm ready to multiply."
Math,"This is going to be equal to-- I gave both the negative signs to the numerator so it's going to be negative 4 times negative 2 in the numerator. And then in the denominator, it's going to be 1 times 1. Let me write that down. 1 times 1. And so this gives us, so we have a negative 4 times a negative 2. So it's a negative times a negative, so we're going to get a positive value here. And 4 times 2 is 8. So this is a positive 8 over 1. And 8 divided by 1 is just equal to 8.."
Math,"So the first thing we want to do since both of these are mixed numbers is to convert them both into improper fractions. So let's start with 2 and 1/4. So we're still going to have 4 in the denominator, but instead of 2 and 1/4, remember, 2 is the same thing as 8/4. So we have 8/4, and then we have another 1/4. That gives us 9/4. Or another way to come up with this 9, you take 4 times 2, which is 8, plus 1. That gives you 9. And then the 1 and 3/4, same process."
Math,"You're going to have 4 in the denominator, and then the numerator is going to be 4 times 1, which is 4, plus 3, which is 7. So this is the exact same problem here. 2 and 1/4 divided by 1 and 3/4 is the same thing as 9/4 divided by 7/4. And we saw in several videos already that dividing by a fraction is the same thing as multiplying by its reciprocal. So this is equivalent to-- so these are all equivalent. This is equivalent to 9/4 times the reciprocal of this."
Math,"We're changing the division operation to a multiplication, and we're taking the reciprocal of the 7/4. For the reciprocal of 7/4, you swap the numerator and denominator, or the top number and the bottom number, and you get 4/7. Now, we could just multiply these. We could just say this is 9 times 4, which would be 36, over 4 times 7, which is 28, and then try to put it in lowest terms, or we could do it right now because it would be simpler. We have a 4 in the numerator."
Math,"We have a 4 in the denominator, that'll eventually be in the denominator, so let's divide our eventual numerators and our eventual denominators both by 4. So you divide this 4 by 4, you get 1. This 4 by 4, you get 1. So now when you multiply it, you get 9 times 1, which is 9, over 1 times 7, which is 7. So we have our answer, but right now, it's an improper fraction. They want us to write it as a mixed number. And to figure it out as a mixed number, we can do it in our heads now."
Math,"I think we've seen this enough times. We say how many times does 7 go into 9? Well, it goes into it exactly one time, but when you take 7 into 9 one time, what do you have left over? Well, you're going to have 2 left over, right? 7 times 1 is 7, and you're going to have 2 left over. You need 2 more to get to 9. So you're going to have 2 left over, so this is 1 and 2/7. And we're done!."
Math,"The width of the page is 21.59 centimeters. How much margin should she leave on the left so that the figure is centered? So let's visualize what's going on. We have a page that's 21.59 centimeters wide. So this distance right over here is 21.59 centimeters. So this right over here, that is our page. Let me draw the actual page. Let me draw that in white, since paper tends to be white. So this is her page. It's 21.59 centimeters wide. It's just like that."
Math,It's a little unusual dimension for a piece of paper. But we'll go with it. And then she wants to place a figure that is 13.09 centimeters wide in the center of the page. So the figure-- I'll do it in magenta. That's not magenta. The figure is 13.09 centimeters. So let's say that this is the figure right over here. So this is the figure that she wants to place in the middle of the page. So this is 13.09 centimeters.
Math,"So the question is, how much margin should she leave on the left so that the figure is centered? So they're really asking, what should this distance be here so that the figure is centered? And the key thing is, if the figure is centered, this distance is going to be the same as this distance, so that the figure is right in the middle. Whatever this is, it's going to be the same as this. So one way we could think about it-- we could say, OK, let's take 13.09 centimeters from 21.59 centimeters."
Math,"And if we do that, then we'll know how much leftover space this plus this combined is. And then we just want to split that space in half. We want half of it to go on the right side, and we want half of it to go on the left side. So let's see how much this left margin and the right margin combined need to be. And that's just 21.59. That's just going to be 21.59 centimeters minus 13.09 centimeters. And this, we get to-- let's see. This is 8.50 centimeters, which is the combined margins."
Math,"Not just the left or not just the right-- this is the left plus the right margin, is 8.50 centimeters. This is this distance plus this distance. Now, if we want to figure out what the left margin should be, if we want to center it. Well, we just want to split this evenly between the left and the right margin. So we just want to divide this by 2. So if you divide 18.50 by 2-- or multiply it by 1/2, I guess. That might be a little bit more obvious-- either way."
Math,"So if we multiply this by 1/2, you are left with 1/2 of 8.50, is 4.25 centimeters. So if we want it centered, this is going to be 4.25 centimeters. And of course, this is going to be 4.25 centimeters, as well. And you see, when you add 4.25 to 4.25, you get 8.5 centimeters. And then you add that to 13.09. You get the entire width of the piece of paper. So how much margin should she leave on the left? 4.25 centimeters.."
Math,"How many hours-- they give us minutes here, now they want hours-- how many hours will it take to prepare 1,200 bags of samples if she asks seven friends to help her with her work? So the one thing we could think about is, how long would it take her to do it by herself? So it takes her, by herself, two minutes per bag. And then we have 1,200 bags, not 12 bags, 1,200 bags which means it's going to take her two minutes for each of the 1,200 bags. Well that's 2 times 1,200 is 2,400 minutes."
Math,"Now that's if she was just working on it by herself, but she's got seven friends. And we can assume that they would all take about two minutes to prepare each bag. Now this is a little bit tricky because you might want to divide this by 7 saying, hey, we're going to have seven times as many people. But you remember, she asks seven friends so there's actually eight people involved. There's Jess and her seven friends. So it's actually going to be eight times faster than if Jess did it by herself."
Math,"This is if she only had one person. If you're going to have eight people, you are going to take eight times less time. So with eight people, it's going to be 2,400 divided by 8 is 300 minutes. And we're almost done, except for the fact that they asked for our answer in terms of hours. So 300 minutes is how many hours? Well you have 60 minutes per hour so you could say 300 minutes-- I'll just write min for short-- divided by 60 minutes per hour gives us 300 divided by 60 is 5 hours."
Math,"So it will take Jess and her seven friends, a total of eight people, five hours to prepare all of her sample bags.."
Math,"traveled. If Sandy starts off with a $20 bill, takes the cab for five miles, and leaves a $1 tip, how much money will she be left with? Well let's first just think about how much this five mile cab ride is going to cost her. So cab-- I'll call it the cab fare. So it's going to be $2.50 just when you get into the cab, plus $2.50 per mile. Well she's going to go for 5 miles-- let me write it this way-- times $2.50 per miles. So the cab fare here is just going to be $2.50, this $2.50, plus 5 times $2.50."
Math,"Let's see, 5 times $2.50, that is $12.50. So this is plus $12.50. $2.50 plus $12.50 is going to be $15. So just the cab fare is going to be $15. And then Sandy gives a $1 tip. So fare plus tip is going to be equal to the cab fare $15 plus $1 which is equal to $16. So then answering the question, how much money would she be left with with a $20 bill? Well we could write her change is going to be, she's going to give a $20 bill, the fare plus tip is $16, minus $16. So she's going to have $4 left in change.."
Math,"Suppose you have 1/3 of a gallon of water that gets frozen. What is the volume of the ice that you now have? So you're starting with 1/3 of a gallon of water. They tell us that when it gets frozen, when it turns into ice, its volume is going to expand by 9%. So the new volume is going to be your existing volume. So this is the original volume, 1/3 of a gallon, and it's going to expand by 9%. So your frozen volume is going to be your original volume plus 9% of your original volume."
Math,"So you could say it's 9% times 1/3. So this right over here is going to be the expanded volume. Now, there's a bunch of ways we can figure it out. We could turn things to decimals or whatever else, but they tell us to express your answer as a fraction. So let's make sure that everything here is a fraction, and then we'll just try to simplify. So the one thing that's sitting here that is not a fraction is our 9%. Well, what does 9% actually represent? Well, 9% literally means 9 per 100."
Math,"So we could rewrite this as-- so this is going to be equal to 1/3 plus, instead of writing 9%, I'll write that as 9 per 100, and then once again times 1/3. And we can simplify this expression right over here. We have a 9 in the numerator, a 3 in the denominator. If we divide both of them by 3, we get a 3 and a 1. And so we're left with 1/3 plus 300 times 1/1. Well, that's just going to be 3/100."
Math,"So this is just going to be equal to 1/3 plus-- I'll write this in orange still, or maybe I'll do it in a new color-- plus 3/100. And now we have to add something, or two numbers that have different denominators. So let's find a common denominator. So this is going to be equal to, well, the least common multiple of 3 and 100."
Math,"And they share no common factor, so it's really just going to be the product of 3 and 100-- the least common multiple is So it's going to be something over 300 plus something over 300. Now to go from 3 to 300, in the denominator you multiply by 100, so you have to multiply the numerator by 100 as well. So 1/3 is the same thing as 100/300. And to go from 100 to 300, we have to multiply by 3 in the denominator, so we have to multiply by 3 in the numerator as well. So 3/100 is the same thing as 9/300."
Math,"And now we're ready to add. This is going to be 100 plus 9/300, which is 109/300. So this is the volume of ice that I now have expressed as a fraction.."
Math,"What is the ratio of how much computers weighed in 1944 to how much a modern laptop weighs? Express your answer as a ratio of two integers. So the ratio of how much computers weighed in 1944-- so we know that's 4,500 kilograms-- we want the ratio of that to how much a modern laptop weighs, and that's 2.7 kilograms. So this right over here is a ratio. But we haven't expressed it as a ratio of two integers. In particular, 4,500 is an integer. But 2.7 is not an integer."
Math,"So the easy way to convert 2.7 to an integer is to move the decimal place one to the right. Or another way of thinking about it is to multiply it by 10. So we can multiply this by 10. But if we just multiplied the denominator by 10, that would change the value of the ratio. In order to not change the value, we have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by 10. This is equivalent to just multiplying this fraction by 10/10, which is the same thing as one. It does not change the value."
Math,"So what do we get? Well, in the numerator, 4,500 times 10 is 45,000. I'll put a comma here. It makes it a little bit easier to read. And in the denominator-- and this is the whole point of why we multiplied by 10-- 2.7 multiplied by 10 is 27. So we now have expressed our answer as a ratio of two integers. So this is completely legitimate. But we could also simplify this. Just looking at this, it looks like 45,000 is divisible by 45, which is divisible by 9. And 27 is also divisible by 9."
Math,"So why don't we divide the numerator and the denominator both by 9? So we're going to divide by 9 in the numerator, and we're going to divide by 9 in the denominator. And we are going to get 45 divided by 9 is 5. So 45,000 divided by 9 is 5,000. So we're going to get 5,000 over-- 27 divided by 9 is 3. And I think we have now simplified this about as much as we can.."
Math,"If each shareholder gets a proportion of the total profit that is equal to the proportion of the share they own, how much money does Mary receive? So first, let's think about what fraction or what percentage or what proportion of the total profit should Mary receive? So Mary owns 4,200 shares. And how many total shares are there in the company? Well, the only owners of this company are Peter, Paul, and Mary. So the total number of shares are the sum of Peter, Paul, and Mary's shares."
Math,"So we know that Peter owns 4,050 shares. We know that Paul owns 2,510. And of course, we know that Mary owns 4,200. So let's figure it. This is the fraction of the profit that Mary should be getting. So let's figure out this with a calculator. So this is going to be 4,200 divided by 4,050 plus 2,510 plus 4,200. And so Mary should get 0.39 of the profit. Or if we talk about it in terms of percentage, it would be 39% of the profit. So this right over here is 0.390. Actually, let me just leave it like that."
Math,"So this is approximately equal to 0.39. And so if we want to figure out how much profit she gets, she gets this much times the total profit. So Mary gets 0.39, and this is the exact quantity right over here. 0.39 is the approximation, so approximately 0.39. This little squiggly equal sign is how I say approximately. She's going to get 0.39 times the total profit, which is $1,500,000. And so let's go back to our calculator. And so we said approximately 0.39. This is the exact value."
Math,"I can get that exact value again, at least on this calculator, by saying Second Answer. This literally means the previous answer. So this is literally this number right over here-- 0.390334 whatever. So this is the exact quantity times $1,500,000. One, two, three, there we go. There's $1,500,000. I've got to make sure I have the right number zeroes there. And that gets us $585,50- and we need to round to the nearest penny-- and $0.86. So let me put that someplace where I can see it."
Math,"So this is going to be equal to $585,501 and, if we round, $0.86. So not bad for one year for Mary. She should be able to live quite well just on her dividends from Puff Incorporated.."
Math,"On Tuesday morning, he deposited another check for $100. How much was in Stewart's checking account after the second deposit, so after both of these deposits right over here. So he starts off with a negative balance. So a negative balance means that he's overdrawn his checking account. He actually owes the bank money now. Luckily, he's now going to put some money in his bank account. So he'll actually have a positive balance in his checking account. So he's starts off with the negative $15.08."
Math,"And then to that, he adds $426.90. And then he adds another $100. So he started off with negative $15.08. And then to that, he adds $426.90 and $100. So that's $526.90. And so how much is going to have in his bank account? He started owing $15.08, and then he's going to add $526.90. So one way to visualize it is, if you think about it on a number line, if this is 0 right over here, he's going to start off at negative $15.08. But then he's going to add $526."
Math,"So this right over here, this is $15.08 to the left. That's how much he owes. And to that, he's going to add $526. So I'm not drawing this to scale. But to that, he is going to add $526.90. So the amount that he's going to be in the positive is going to be $526.90 minus the $15.08. It's essentially going to be this length right over here. That's how much he's going to be in the positive. And that's going to be $526.90 minus $15.08."
Math,"So that's going to be, and we can even just rewrite this so it actually looks exactly like that. That's exactly the same thing as $526.90 minus-- adding a negative is the same thing as subtracting a positive-- minus $15.08. And this is-- I will do this in another color-- $526.90 minus $15.08. Let's see, 0 is less than 8. Let's make that a 10 and borrow from this 9. So that becomes an 8, or I guess you could say we're regrouping. Now, everything up here is larger than everything there. So 10 minus 8 is 2."
Math,8 minus 0 is 8. We have our decimal. 6 minus 5 is 1. 2 minus 1 is 1. And then you have 5 minus nothing. So he is left with $511.82 after his second deposit..
Math,"Well that literally means just taking a -3. And there's nothing left to multiply it with. So this is just going to be equal to -3. Now what happens if you were take a -3, and we were to raise it to the 2nd power? Well that's equivalent to taking 2 -3's, so a -3 and a -3, and then multiplying them together. What's that going to be? Well a negative times a negative is a positive. So that is going to be positive 9. Let me write this. It's going to be positive 9. Well, let's keep going."
Math,"Let's see if there is some type of pattern here. Let's take -3 and raise it to the 3rd power. What is this going to be equal to? Well, we're going to take 3 -3's, [WRITING] – and we're going to multiply them together. So we're going to multiply them together. -3 × -3, we already figured out is positive 9. But positive 9 × -3, well that's that's -27. And so you might notice a pattern here."
Math,"Whenever we raised raised a negative base to an exponent, if we raise it to an odd exponent, we are going to get a negative value. And that's because when you multiply negative numbers an even number of times, a negative number times a negative number is a positive. But then you have one more negative number to multiply the result by – which makes it negative."
Math,"And if you take a negative base, and you raise it to an even power, that's because if you multiply a negative times a negative, you're going to get a positive. And so when you do it an even number of times, doing it a multiple-of-two number of times. So the negatives and the negatives all cancel out, I guess you could say. Or when you take the product of the two negatives, you keep getting positives. So this right over here is going to give you a positive value."
Math,"So there's really nothing new about taking powers of negative numbers. It's really the same idea. And you just really have to remember that a negative times a negative is a positive. And a negative times a positive is a negative, which we already learned from multiplying negative numbers. Now there's one other thing that I want to clarify – because sometimes there might be ambiguity if someone writes this. Let's say someone writes that."
Math,"And I encourage you to actually pause the video and think about with this right over here would evaluate to. And, if you given a go at that, think about whether this should mean something different then that. Well this one can be a little bit and big ambiguous and if people are strict about order of operations, you should really be thinking about the exponent before you multiply by this -1. You could this is implicitly saying -1 × 2^3."
Math,"So many times, this will usually be interpreted as negative 2 to the third power, which is equal to -8, while this is going to be interpreted as -2 to the third power. Now that also is equal to -8. You might say well what's what's the big deal here? Well what if this was what if these were even exponents. So what if someone had give myself some more space here. What if someone had these to express its -4 or a -4 squared or -4 squared. This one clearly evaluates to 16 – positive 16."
Math,"It's a negative 4 times a *4. This one could be interpreted as is. Especially if you look at order of operations, and you do your exponent first, this would be interpreted as -4 times 4, which would be -16. So it's really important to think about this properly. And if you want to write the number negative if you want the base to be negative 4, put parentheses around it and then write the exponent.."
Math,"You could literally view this as taking eight 1's, and then multiplying them together. So let's do that. So you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight 1's, and then you're going to multiply them together. And if you were to do that, you would get well, 1 times 1 is 1, times 1-- it doesn't matter how many times you multiply 1 by 1. You are going to just get 1. You are just going to get 1. And you could imagine. I did it eight times. I multiplied eight 1's."
Math,"But even if this was 80, or if this was 800, or if this was 8 million, if I just multiplied 1-- if I had 8 million 1's, and I multiplied them all together, it would still be equal to 1. So 1 to any power is just going to be equal to 1. And you might say, hey, what about 1 to the 0 power? Well, we've already said anything to 0 power, except for 0-- that's where we're going to-- it's actually up for debate. But anything to the 0 power is going to be equal to 1."
Math,"And just as a little bit of intuition here, you could literally view this as our other definition of exponentiation, which is you start with a 1, and this number says how many times you're going to multiply that 1 times this number. So 1 times 1 zero times is just going to be 1."
Math,"And that was a little bit clearer when we did it like this, where we said 2 to the, let's say, fourth power is equal to-- this was the other definition of exponentiation we had, which is you start with a 1, and then you multiply it by 2 four times, so times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, which is equal to-- let's see, this is equal to 16. So here if you start with a 1 and then you multiply it by 1 zero times, you're still going to have that 1 right over there."
Math,"And that's why anything that's not 0 to the 1 power is going to be equal to 1. Now let's try some other interesting scenarios. Let's start try some negative numbers. So let's take negative 1. And let's first raise it to the 0 power. So once again, this is just going, based on this definition, this is starting with a 1 and then multiplying it by this number 0 times. Well, that means we're just not going to multiply it by this number. So you're just going to get a 1. Let's try negative 1."
Math,"Let's try negative 1 to the first power. Well, anything to the first power, you could view this-- and I like going with this definition as opposed to this one right over here. If we were to make them consistent, if you were to make this definition consistent with this, you would say hey, let's start with a 1, and then multiply it by 1 eight times. And you're still going to get a 1 right over here. But let's do this with negative 1."
Math,"So we're going to start with a 1, and then we're going to multiply it by negative 1 one time-- times negative 1. And this is, of course, going to be equal to negative 1. Now let's take negative 1, and let's take it to the second power. We often say that we are squaring it when we take something to the second power. So negative 1 to the second power-- well, we could start with a 1. We could start with a 1, and then multiply it by negative 1 two times-- multiply it by negative 1 twice."
Math,"And what's this going to be equal to? And once again, by our old definition, you could also just say, hey, ignoring this one, because that's not going to change the value, we took two negative 1's and we're multiplying them. Well, negative 1 times negative 1 is 1. And I think you see a pattern forming. Let's take negative 1 to the third power."
Math,"What's this going to be equal to? Well, by this definition, you start with a 1, and then you multiply it by negative 1 three times, so negative 1 times negative 1 times negative 1. Or you could just think of it as you're taking three negative 1's and you're multiplying it, because this 1 doesn't change the value. And this is going to be equal to negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1, times negative 1 is negative 1. So you see the pattern. Negative 1 to the 0 power is 1."
Math,"Negative 1 to the first power is negative 1. Then you multiply it by negative 1, you're going to get positive 1. Then you multiply it by negative 1 again to get negative 1. And the pattern you might be seeing is if you take negative 1 to an odd power you're going to get negative 1. And if you take it to an even power, you're going to get 1 because a negative times a negative is going to be the positive."
Math,"And you're going to have an even number of negatives, so that you're always going to have negative times negatives. So this right over here, this is even. Even is going to be positive 1. And then you could see that if you went to negative 1 to the fourth power. Negative 1 the fourth power? Well, you could start with a 1 and then multiply it by negative 1 four times, so a negative 1 times negative 1, times negative 1, times negative 1, which is just going to be equal to positive 1."
Math,"So if someone were to ask you-- we already established that if someone were to take 1 to the, I don't know, 1 millionth power, this is just going to be equal to 1. If someone told you let's take negative 1 and raise it to the 1 millionth power, well, 1 million is an even number, so this is still going to be equal to positive 1. But if you took negative 1 to the 999,999th power, this is an odd number. So this is going to be equal to negative 1.."
Math,"The whole point is so that we have one way to interpret a mathematical statement. So let's say I have the mathematical statement 7 plus 3 times 5. Now if we didn't all agree on order of operations, there would be two ways of interpreting this statement. You could just read it left to right, so you could say well, let me just take 7 plus 3, you could say 7 plus 3 and then multiply that times 5. And 7 plus 3 is 10, and then you multiply that by 5. 10 times 5, it would get you 50."
Math,"So that's one way you would interpret it if we didn't agree on an order of operations. Maybe it's a natural way. You just go left to right. Another way you could interpret it you say, I like to do multiplication before I do addition. So you might interpret it as -- I'll try to color code it -- 7 plus -- and you do the 3 times 5 first. 7 plus 3 times 5, which would be 7 plus 3 times 5 is 15, and 7 plus 15 is 22. So notice, we interpreted this statement in two different ways."
Math,"This was just straight left to right doing addition then the multiplication. This way we did the multiplication first then the addition, we got two different answers, and that's just not cool in mathematics. If this was part of some effort to send something to the moon because two people interpreted it a different way or another one computer interpreted one way and another computer interpreted it another way, the satellite might go to mars."
Math,"So this is just completely unacceptable, and that's why we have to have an agreed upon order of operations. An agreed upon way to interpret this statement. So the agreed upon order of operations is to do parentheses first -- let me write it over here -- then do exponents. If you don't know what exponents are don't worry about it right now. In this video we're not going to have any exponents in our examples, so you don't really have to worry about them for this video."
Math,"Then you do multiplication -- I'll just right mult, short for multiplication -- then you do multiplication and division next, they kind of have the same level of priority. And then finally you do addition and subtraction. So what does this order of operations -- let me label it -- this right here, that is the agreed upon order of operations. If we follow these order of operations we should always get to the same answer for a given statement."
Math,"So what does this tell us? What is the best way to interpret this up here? Well we have no parentheses -- parentheses look like that. Those little curly things around numbers. We don't have any parentheses here. I'll do some examples that do have parentheses. We don't have any exponents here. But we do have some multiplication and division or we actually just have some multiplication. So we'll order of operations, do the multiplication and division first. So it says do the multiplication first."
Math,"That's a multiplication. So it says do this operation first. It gets priority over addition or subtraction. So if we do this first we get the 3 times 5, which is 15, and then we add the 7. The addition or subtraction -- I'll do it here, addition, we just have addition. Just like that. So we do the multiplication first, get 15, then add the 7, 22. So based upon the agreed order of operations, this right here is the correct answer. The correct way to interpret this statement. Let's do another example."
Math,"I think it'll make things a little bit more clear, and I'll do the example in pink. So let's say I have 7 plus 3 -- I'll put some parentheses there -- times 4 divided by 2 minus 5 times 6. So there's all sorts of crazy things here, but if you just follow the order of operations you'll simplify it in a very clean way and hopefully we'll all get the same answer. So let's just follow the order of operations. The first thing we have to do is look for parentheses. Are there parentheses here? Yes, there are."
Math,"There's parentheses around the 7 plus 3. So it says let's do that first. So 7 plus 3 is 10. So this we can simplify, just looking at this order operations, to 10 times all of that. Let me copy and paste that so I don't have to keep re-writing it. So that simplifies to 10 times all of that. We did our parentheses first. Then what do we do? There are no more parentheses in this expression. Then we should do exponents."
Math,"I don't see any exponents here, and if you're curious what exponents look like, an exponent would look like 7 squared. You'd see these little small numbers up in the top right. We don't have any exponents here so we don't have to worry about it. Then it says to do multiplication and division next. So where do we see multiplication? We have a multiplication, a division, a multiplication again."
Math,"Now, when you have multiple operations at the same level, when our order of operations, multiplication and division are the same level, then you do left to right. So in this situation you're going to multiply by 4 and then divide by 2. You won't multiply by 4 divided by 2. Then we'll do the 5 times 6 before we do the subtraction right here. So let's figure out what this is. So we'll do this multiplication first. We could simultaneously do this multiplication because it's not going to change things."
Math,"But I'll do things one step at a time. So the next step we're going to do is this 10 times 4. 10 times 4 is 40. 10 times 4 is 40, then you have 40 divided by 2 and it simplifies to that right there. Remember, multiplication and division, they're at the exact same level so we're going to do it left to right. You could also express this as multiplying by 1/2 and then it wouldn't matter the order. But for simplicity, multiplication and division go left to right."
Math,"So then you have 40 divided by 2 minus 5 times 6. So, division, you just have one division here, you want to do that. You have this division and you have this multiplication, they're not together so you can actually kind of do them simultaneously."
Math,"And to make it clear that you do this before you do the subtraction because multiplication and division take priority over addition and subtraction, we could put parentheses around them to say look, we're going to do that and that first before I do that subtraction, because multiplication and division have priority. So 40 divided by 2 is 20. We're going to have that minus sign, minus 5 times 6 is 30. 20 minus 30 is equal to negative 10. And that is the correct interpretation of that."
Math,"So I want to make something very, very, very clear. If you have things at the same level, so if you have 1 plus 2 minus 3 plus 4 minus 1. So addition and subtraction are all the same level in order of operations, you should go left to right. So you should interpret this as 1 plus 2 is 3, so this is the same thing as 3 minus 3 plus 4 minus 1. Then you do 3 minus 3 is 0 plus 4 minus 1. Or this is the same thing as 4 minus 1, which is the same thing as 3. You just go left to right."
Math,"Same thing if you have multiplication and division, they're at the same level. So if you have 4 times 2 divided by 3 times 2, you do 4 times 2 is 8 divided by 3 times 2. And you say 8 divided by 3 is, well, we got a fraction there. It would be 8/3. So this would be 8/3 times 2. And then 8/3 times to is equal to 16 over 3. That's how you interpret it. You don't do this multiplication first or divide the 2 by that and all of that."
Math,"Now the one time where you can be loosey-goosey with order of operations, if you have all addition or all multiplication. So if you have 1 plus 5 plus 7 plus 3 plus 2, it does not matter what order you do it in. You can do the 2 plus 3, you can go from the right to the left, you can go from the left to the right, you could start some place in between. If it's only all addition. And the same thing is true if you have all multiplication. It's 1 times 5 times 7 times 3 times 2."
Math,"It does not matter what order you're doing it. But it's only with all multiplication or all addition. If there was some division in here, if there's some subtraction in here, you're best off just going left to right.."
Math,"Parentheses. P for parentheses. Then exponents. Don't worry if you don't know what exponents are, because this has no exponents in them. Then you're going to do multiplication and division. They're at the same level. Then you do addition and subtraction. So some people remember PEMDAS. But if you remember PEMDAS, remember multiplication, division, same level. Addition and subtraction, also at the same level. So let's figure what the order of operations say that this should evaluate to."
Math,"So the first thing we're going to do is our parentheses. And we have a lot of parentheses here. We have this expression in parentheses right there, and then even within that we have these parentheses. So our order of operations say, look, do your parentheses first, but in order to evaluate this outer parentheses-- this orange thing-- we're going to have to evaluate this thing in yellow right there. So let's evaluate this whole thing."
Math,"So how can we simplify it? Well, if we look at just inside of it, the first thing we want to do is simplify the parentheses inside the parentheses. So you see this 5 minus 2 right there? We're going to do that first no matter what. And that's easy to evaluate. 5 minus 2 is 3. And so this simplifies to-- I'll do it step by step. Once you get the hang of it, you can do multiple steps at once. So this is going to be 7 plus 3 times the 5 minus 2, which is 3. And all of those have parentheses around it."
Math,"And of course, you have all the stuff on either side-- the divide 4-- no. That's not what I want. I wanted to copy and paste. I want to copy and paste that right there. So copy, then-- no, that's giving me the wrong thing. It would've been easier-- let me just rewrite it. That's the easiest thing. I'm having technical difficulties. So divided by 4 times 2. And on this side, you had that 7 times 2 plus this thing in orange parentheses there. Now, at any step you just look again."
Math,"We always want to do parentheses first. Well, you keep wanting to do and is there really no parentheses left? So we have to evaluate this parentheses in orange here. So we have to evaluate this thing first. But in order to evaluate this thing, we have to look inside of it. And when you look inside of it, you have 7 plus 3 times 3. So if you just had 7 plus 3 times 3, how would you evaluate it? Well, look back to your order of operations."
Math,"We're inside the parentheses here, so inside of it there are no longer any parentheses. So the next thing we should do is-- there are no exponents. There is multiplication. So we do that before we do any addition or subtraction. So we want to do the 3 times 3 before we add the 7. So this is going to be 7 plus-- and the 3 times 3 we want to do first. We want to do the multiplication first. 7 plus 9. That's going to be in the orange parentheses."
Math,"And then you have the 7 times 2 plus that, on the left hand side. You have the divided by 4 times 2 on the right hand side. And now this-- the thing in parentheses-- because we still want to do the parentheses first. Pretty easy to evaluate. What's 7 plus 9? 7 plus 9 is 16. And so everything we have simplifies to 7 times 2 plus 16 divided by 4 times 2. Now we don't have any parentheses left, so we don't have to worry about the P in PEMDAS. We have no E, no exponents in this."
Math,"So then we go straight to multiplication and division. We have a multiplication-- we have some multiplication going on there. We have some division going on here, and a multiplication there. So we should do these next, before we do this addition right there. So we could do this multiplication. We could do that multiplication. 7 times 2 is 14. We're going to wait to do that addition. And then here we have a 16 divided by 4 times 2."
Math,"That gets priority of the addition, so we're going to do that before we do the addition. But how do we evaluate that? Do we do the division first, or the multiplication first? And remember, I told you in the last video, when you have 2-- when you have multiple operations of the same level-- in this case, division and multiplication-- they're at the same level. You're safest going left to right. Or you should go left to right. So you do 16 divided by 4 is 4."
Math,So this thing right here-- simplify 16 divided by 4 times 2. It simplifies to 4 times 2. That's this thing in green right there. And then we're going to want to do the multiplication next. So this is going to simplify to-- because multiplication takes priority over addition-- this simplifies to 8. And so you get 14-- this 14 right here-- plus 8. And what's 14 plus 8? That is 22. That is equal to 22. And we are done..
Math,"Parentheses first. Then you do exponents. Exponents. And there is an exponent in this problem right over here. Then you want to do multiplication. Multiplication and division. And then finally, you do addition and subtraction. So let's just try to tackle this as best we can. So first, let's do the parentheses. We have a 3 plus 2 here in parentheses, so we can evaluate that to be equal to 5."
Math,"And let's see, we could do other things in other parts of this expression that won't affect what's going on right here in the parentheses. We have this negative 5 squared. Or I should just, we're subtracting a 5 squared. We want to do the exponent before we worry about it being subtracted. So this 5 squared over here we can rewrite as 25. And so let's not do too many steps at once. So this whole thing will simplify to negative 1. And then in brackets, we have negative 7 plus 2 times 5. And then, 2 times 5."
Math,"And then close brackets. Minus 25. Now, this thing-- we want to do multiplication. You could say, hey, wait. I still have a parentheses here. Why don't I do that first? But when you just evaluate what's inside of this parentheses, you just get a negative 7. It doesn't really change anything. So we can just leave this here as a negative 7. And this expression. We do want to evaluate this whole expression before we do anything else."
Math,"I mean, we could distribute this negative 1 and all of that, but let's just do straight up order of operations here. So let's evaluate this expression. We want to do multiplication before we add anything. So we get 2 times 5 right over there. 2 times 5 is 10. That is 10. So our whole expression becomes-- and normally, you wouldn't have to rewrite the expression this many times. But we're going to do it this time just to make sure no one gets confused. So it becomes negative 1 times negative 7 plus 10."
Math,"Plus 10. And we close our brackets. Minus 25. Now, we can evaluate this pretty easily. Negative 7 plus 10. We're starting at negative 7. So I was going to draw a number line there. So we're starting-- let me draw a number line. So we're starting at negative 7. So the length of this line is negative 7. And then, we're adding 10 to it. We're adding 10 to it. So we're going to move 10 to the right. If we move 7 to the right, we get back to 0. And then we're going to go another 3 after that."
Math,"So we're going to go 7, 8, 9, 10. So that gets us to positive 3. Another way to think about it is we are adding integers of different signs. We can view the sum as going to be the difference of the integers. And since the larger integer is positive, our answer will be positive. So you could literally just view this as 10 minus 7. 10 minus 7 is 3. So this becomes a 3. And so our entire expression becomes negative 1. Negative 1 times. And just to be clear, brackets and parentheses are really the same thing."
Math,"Sometimes people will write brackets around a lot of parentheses just to make it a little bit easier to read. But they're really just the same thing as parentheses. So these brackets out here, I could just literally write them like that. And then I have a minus 25 out over here. Now, once again, you want to do multiplication or division before we do addition and subtraction. So let's multiply the negative 1 times 3 is negative 3. And now we need to subtract our 25. So negative 3 minus 25."
Math,"We are adding two integers of the same sign. We're already at negative 3 and we're going to become 25 more negative than that. So you can view this as we're moving 25 more in the negative direction. Or you could view it as 3 plus 25 is 28. But we're doing it in the negative direction, so it's negative 28. So this is equal to negative 28. And we are done.."
Math,"So this first one says, which of the following expressions are equivalent to negative two times the quantity five minus three? Now you could, of course, just figure out that five minus three is two and then multiply that times negative two and you would get negative four. And you could see which of these is equal to negative four. And that would be fair, but the whole point of this video is to understand that look, maybe I could apply the distributive property here. So let's do that."
Math,"So what I could do is I could distribute this negative two. I could multiply it times five and then I could multiply it by, I could either do it as it's going to be negative two times five plus negative two times negative three. Or you could view it as negative two times five minus negative two times positive three. Now let me write those two things down. So you could do this as negative two times five, negative two times five negative plus negative two times negative three. You could view it that way."
Math,"Or you could view it as negative two, negative two times five and if I'm putting a minus here then I'm gonna view this as a positive three, that we're subtracting a positive three. So minus negative two times positive three. Notice I either wrote the negative here and wrote a positive here, or I wrote the negative here and made this a positive three. But these are going to be equivalent. Either way I've distributed this negative two. Notice I have a negative two, negative two."
Math,"And what are these going to be equal to? Well, negative two times five is negative 10 and then, and then negative two times negative three is positive six, or over here negative two times three is negative six, but then we subtract it so it's just gonna get positive, you're gonna get positive six either way. This right over here is positive six and this over here, subtracting a negative six would give you positive six. So you get negative ten plus six. And that's this choice right over here."
Math,"Which of course does evaluate to negative four, which this expression does evaluate to. This one up here evaluates to negative 16. And of course I won't select this because I found an answer. Let's do several more. Which of the following expressions are equivalent to negative S times T times S? Select all that apply. And here we can't just substitute, we can't just evaluate it and see, oh what do these evaluate to. We need to do a little bit of manipulation of these variables."
Math,"Well there's a couple of ways to think about it. One, we could change the order in which we multiply these things. So we could view this as negative S, that's that, let me write it a little bit neater. We could view it as negative S times S, times S times T. Times, oops, let me do that in a different color, times S times T. Times T. And do any of the choices look like that? Well almost. Instead of saying negative S times S, this says S times negative S."
Math,"And because multiplication, once again, I'm not a big fan of using the word because it sounds complicated, but it's commutative. A times B is the same thing as B times A. So I can rewrite this as, I can rewrite this, I can swap these two and write this as S times, S times negative S times T, times T. Times T. All I did is I swapped these two. This negative S and this S. I just swapped them and I got exactly what I have right over here."
Math,"Now let's just make sure that this one does not apply and maybe the easiest way is to try to simplify this. And the best way I could think about that is by distributing this S. So if I distribute this S, what I'm going to get, this is going to be equal to S times T, which is ST. Or I could even, I can write it like this. I could write it S times T, like that. And then I have minus S times S, so minus S times S. I could write it that was or I could write minus S squared if I want to."
Math,"That's the same thing as S times S. But this is very different. This is very different. Here I'm just taking the product of three variables here, I have two different terms, taking the product of two variables here and then the product I guess you could say I'm taking S squared or I'm taking S times S. So this is not, this is not the same thing."
Math,"Which of the following expressions are equal to negative X times, and then in parentheses negative Y times X? And I forgot to mention it, but like always, pause the video, try to work them out by yourself before I do them. Alright, select all that apply. So let's just try to manipulate this a little bit. So once again, multiplication, it's associative. I could, so it's negative X times, times negative Y times X."
Math,"So, the way it's written here, I could do these first, that's essentially what's written over here. Or it's associative. Instead, I could do these first. And the reason why I find this interesting is a negative times a negative is going to be a positive. So this is going to be the same thing, this thing over here is going to be the same thing as positive X times positive Y. Negative times a negative is a positive. So you're gonna get positive X times Y and then you're multiplying by an X again."
Math,"Multiplying by an X again. Now the other thing we know about multiplication is it's commutative. We can change the order in which we multiply. Because I don't see this quite, I don't see this going on over here yet. So let's see, if I change the order, if I put the Xs, if I multiply the Xs first, I could write this as, I could write this as X times X, X times X times Y, times Y. All I did is I swapped these two. Once again, I can swap the order when I'm multiplying."
Math,"And I don't quite see this yet, but X times X, that's the same thing as X squared. This thing right over here, that's X squared. So this is going to be X squared, X squared times Y, which is exactly what we have over there. Now what does this one evaluate to? Now this one actually evaluates to a number. Because regardless of what X you pick, X minus X, that's going to be zero. Zero times anything is going to be zero. So this thing is going to be equal to zero."
Math,"So this is different than what's going on over here. So I definitely would not pick that. Let's do one more. Which of the following expressions are equivalent to A times negative 10 plus 11? Well once again, you know the instinct when you see something like this well I'd love to distribute that A, it's just sitting there. So let's do that. A times negative 10 would be negative 10 times A, or negative 10A."
Math,"And then A times 11, so it's gonna be plus, A times 11 is the same thing as 11 times A, which we could write as 11A. Now which of these choices are that? Negative 10A plus 11A. So this is negative 10A plus 11A, so this one looks right. Now what about this one? Well here they just swapped the order. If you put the 11A first, you could write it this way. If you write the 11A first, we could write and then we have, instead of saying it negative 10A, we just say minus 10A."
Math,"Once again I just took, all I did is I took this thing and I put it out front. So these two things are actually equivalent. So I would select that one as well.."
Math,"And this might seem a little bit obvious, but how many Chuck Norrises do I now have? Well, 2 Chuck Norrises, we can represent this as literally a Chuck Norris plus a Chuck Norris. So let me do that, a Chuck Norris plus another Chuck Norris, 2 Chuck Norrises. You could also do this 2 times Chuck Norris, and this is just another way of representing it. And 3 Chuck Norrises-- you could do that as a Chuck Norris plus a Chuck Norris plus another Chuck Norris."
Math,"And so we would have a grand total-- and this might be very simple for you. But you would have a grand total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Chuck Norrises. So this would be equal to 5 Chuck Norrises. Now, let's get a little bit more abstract here. Chuck Norris is a very tangible thing. So let's go to a little bit more of traditional algebraic notation. If I have 2x's and remember, you could do this as 2x's or 2 times x. And to that, I would add 3x's How many x's do I have? Well, once again, 2x's, that's 2 times x."
Math,"You could do that as an x plus an x. We don't know what the value of x is. But whatever that value is, we can add it to itself. And then 3x's are they're going to be that value. Let me do that in that same green color. 3x's are going to be that value plus that value plus whatever that value is. And so how many x's do I now have? Well, I'm going to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 x's. So 2x plus 3x is equal to 5x."
Math,"And if you think about it, all we really did-- and hopefully, you conceptually get it-- is we just added the 2 numbers that were multiplying the x. And these numbers, the 2 or the 3, they're called coefficients. Very fancy word, but it's just this constant number, this regular number that's multiplied by the variable. You just added the 2 and the 3, to get your 5x. Now, let's think about this a little bit more. Let's go back to this original expression, the 2 Chuck Norrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises."
Math,"Let's say, to that, we were to add to some type of a-- let's we were to add 7 plums over here. So this is my drawing of a plum. So we have 7 plums plus 2 Chuck Norrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises. And let's say that I add another 2 plums. I add another 2 plums here. So what this whole thing be? Well, I wouldn't add the 7 to the 2 to the 3 plus the 2. We're adding different things here. You have 2 Chuck Norrises and 3 Chuck Norrises, so they're still going to simplify to 5 Chuck Norrises. ."
Math,"And then we would separately think about the plums. We have 7 plums, and we're adding another 2 plums. We're going to have 9 plums. Plus 9 plums, so this simplifies to five Chuck Norrises and 9 plums. Similarly, over here, instead of just 2x plus 3x, if I had 7y plus 2x plus 3x plus 2y, what do I now have? Well, I can't add the x's and the y's. They could very well represent a different number. So all I can do is really add the x's. And then I get the 5x. And then, I'd separately add the y."
Math,"If I have 7y's and to that I add 2y's, I'm going to have 9y's. If I have 7 of something and I add 2 of something, I now have 9 of that something. So I'm going to have 9y's. So you add that. Do that in a different color. You add this and this. You get that. You add the x's. You get that right over there. So hopefully, that makes a little sense. Actually I'll throw out one more idea."
Math,"So given this, what would happen if I were to have 2x plus 1 plus 7x plus 5? Well, once again, you might be tempted to add the 2 plus the 1, but they're adding different things. These are 2x's. This is just the number 1. So you really just have to add the x's together. So you're going to say, well, I got 2x's. And I'm going to add 7x's to that. Well, that means I now have 9x's. And then, separately, you'd say, well, I've got just the abstract number 1. And then I've got another 5."
Math,1 plus 5 is going to be equal to 6..
Math,"And we'll see we're just applying ideas that we already knew about. Let's say I want to simplify the expression 2 times 3x plus 5. Well, this literally means two 3x plus 5's. So this is the exact same thing. This is one 3x plus 5, and then to that, I'm going to add another 3x plus 5. This is literally what 2 times 3x plus 5 means. Well, this is the same thing as, if we just look at it right over here, we have now two 3x's. So we could write it as 2 times 3x. Plus, we have two 5's, so plus 2 times 5."
Math,"You might say, hey, Sal, isn't this just the distributive property that I know from arithmetic? I've essentially just distributed the 2? 2 times 3x plus 2 times 5? And I would tell you, yes, it is. And the whole reason why I'm doing this is just to show you that it is exactly what you already know. But with that out of the way, let's continue to simplify it. When you multiply the 2 times the 3x, you get 6x. When you multiply the 2 times the 5, you get 10. So this simplified to 6x plus 10."
Math,"Now let's try something that's a little bit more involved. Once again, really just things that you already know. Let's say I had 7 times 3y minus 5 minus 2 times 10 plus 4y. Let's see if we can simplify this. Well, let's work on the left-hand side of the expression, the 7 times 3y minus 5. We just have to distribute the 7. This is going to be 7 times 3y, which is going to give us 21y. Or if I had 3 y's 7 times, that's going to be 21 y's, either way you want to think about it."
Math,"And then I have 7 times-- we've got to be careful with the sign-- negative 5. 7 times negative 5 is negative 35. So we've simplified this part of it. Let's simplify the right-hand side. You might be tempted to say, oh, 2 times 10 and 2 times 4y and then subtract them. And if you do that right and you distribute the subtraction, it would work out. But I like think of this as negative 2, and we're going to distribute the negative 2 times 10 and the negative 2 times 4y."
Math,"So negative 2 times 10 is negative 20, so it's minus 20 right over here. And then negative 2 times 4, negative 2 times 4 is negative 8, so it's going to be negative 8y. Let's write a minus 8y right over here. And are we done simplifying? Well, no, there's a little bit more that we can do. We can't add the 21y to the negative 35 or the negative 20 because these are adding different things or subtracting different things. But we do have two things that are multiplying y. Let me do all in this green color."
Math,"You have 21 y's right over here. And then we can view it as from that we are subtracting 8 y's. So if I have 21 of something and I take 8 of them away, I'm left with 13 of that something. So those are going to simplify to 13 y's. I'll do this in a new color. And then I have negative 35 minus 20. That's just going to simplify to negative 55. So this whole thing simplified, using a little bit of the distributive property and combining similar or like terms, we got to 13y minus 55.."
Math,"So this one is even crazier than the last few we've looked at. We've got y's and xy's, and x squared and x's, well more just xy's and y squared and on and on and on. And there will be a temptation, because you see a y here and a y here to say, oh, maybe I can add this negative 3y plus this 4xy somehow since I see a y and a y. But the important thing to realize here is that a y is different than an xy. Think about it they were numbers."
Math,"If y was 3 and an x was a 2, then a y would be a 3 while an xy would have been a 6. And a y is very different than a y squared. Once again, if the why it took on the value 3, then the y squared would be the value 9. So even though you see the same letter here, they aren't the same-- I guess you cannot add these two or subtract these two terms. A y is different than a y squared, is different than an xy. Now with that said, let's see if there is anything that we can simplify."
Math,"So first, let's think about the y terms. So you have a negative 3y there. Do we have any more y term? Yes, we do. We have this 2y right over there. So I'll just write it out-- I'll just reorder it. So we have negative 3y plus 2y. Now, let's think about-- and I'm just going in an arbitrary order, but since our next term is an xy term-- let's think about all of the xy terms. So we have plus 4xy right over here. So let me just write it down-- I'm just reordering the whole expression-- plus 4xy."
Math,"And then I have minus 4xy right over here. Then let's go to the x squared terms. I have negative 2 times x squared, or minus 2x squared. So let's look at this. So I have minus 2x squared. Do I have any other x squared? Yes, I do. I have this 3x squared right over there. So plus 3x squared. And then let's see, I have an x term right over here, and that actually looks like the only x term. So that's plus 2x. And then I only have one y squared term-- I'll circle that in orange-- so plus y squared."
Math,"So all I have done is I've reordered the statement and I've color coded it based on the type of term we have. And now it should be a little bit simpler. So let's try it out. If I have negative 3 of something plus 2 of that something, what do I have? Or another way to say it, if I have two of something and I subtract 3 of that, what am I left with? Well, I'm left with negative 1 of that something. So I could write negative 1y, or I could just write negative y."
Math,"And another way you could think about it, but I like to think about it intuitively more, is what's the coefficient here? It is negative 3. What's the coefficient here? It's 2. Where obviously both are dealing-- they're both y terms, not xy terms, not y squared terms, just y. And so negative 3 plus 2 is negative 1, or negative 1y is the same thing as negative y. So those simplify to this right over here. Now let's look at the xy terms."
Math,"If I have 4 of this, 4 xy's and I were to take away 4 xy's, how many xy's am I left with? Well, I'm left with no xy's. Or you could say add the coefficients, 4 plus negative 4, gives you 0 xy's. Either way, these two cancel out. If I have 4 of something and I take away those 4 of that something, I'm left with none of them. And so I'm left with no xy's. And then I have right over here-- I could have written 0xy, but that seems unnecessary-- then right over here I have my x squared terms."
Math,"Negative 2 plus 3 is 1. Or another way of saying it, if I have 3x squared and I were to take away 2 of those x squared, so I'm left with the 1x squared. So this right over here simplifies to 1x squared. Or I could literally just write x squared. 1x squared is the same thing as x squared. So plus x squared, and then these there's nothing really left to simplify. So plus 2x plus y squared. And we're done."
Math,"And obviously you might have gotten an answer in some other order, but the order in which I write these terms don't matter. It just matters that you were able to simplify it to these four terms.."
Math,"All right, I'm assuming you have attempted it. Now let's look at it. We have -5.55 minus 8.55c plus 4.35c. So the first thing I wanna do is can I combine these c terms, and I definitely can. We can add -8.55c to 4.35c first, and then that would be, let's see, that would be -8.55 plus 4.35, I'm just adding the coefficients, times c, and of course, we still have that -5.55 out front. -5.55. I'll just put a plus there."
Math,"Now how do we calculate -8.55 plus 4.35? Well there's a couple of ways to think about it or visualize it. One way is to say well this is the same thing as the negative of 8.55 minus 4.35, and 8.55 minus 4.35, let's see, eight minus four is going to be the negative, eight minus four is four, 55 hundredths minus 35 hundredths is 20 hundredths. So I could write 4.20, which is really just the same thing as 4.2. So all of this can be replaced with a -4.2."
Math,"So my entire expression has simplified to -5.55, and instead of saying plus -4.2c, I can just write it as minus 4.2c, and we're done. We can't simplify this anymore. We can't add this term that doesn't involve the variable to this term that does involve the variable. So this is about as simple as we're gonna get. So let's do another example. So here I have some more hairy numbers involved. These are all expressed as fractions. And so, let's see, I have 2/5m minus 4/5 minus 3/5m."
Math,"So how can I simplify? Well I could add all the m terms together. So let me just change the order. I could rewrite this as 2/5m minus 3/5m minus 4/5. All I did was I changed the order. We can see that I have these two m terms. I can add those two together. So this is going to be 2/5 minus 3/5 times m, and then I have the -4/5 still on the right hand side. Now what's 2/5 minus 3/5? Well that's gonna be -1/5. That's gonna be -1/5. So I have -1/5m minus 4/5. Minus 4/5. Now once again, I'm done."
Math,"I can't simplify it anymore. I can't add this term that involves m somehow to this -4/5. So we are done here. Let's do one more. Let's do one more example. So here, and this is interesting, I have a parentheses and all the rest. Like always, pause the video. See if you can simplify this. All right, let's work through it together. Now the first thing that I want to do is let's distribute this two so that we just have three terms that are just being added and subtracted."
Math,"So if we distribute this two, we're gonna get two times 1/5m is 2/5m. Let me make sure you see that m. M is right here. Two times -2/5 is -4/5, and then I have plus 3/5. Now how can we simplify this more? Well I have these two terms here that don't involve the variable. Those are just numbers. I can add them to each other. So I have -4/5 plus 3/5. So what's negative four plus three? That's going to be negative one. So this is going to be -1/5, what we have in yellow here."
Math,"I still have the 2/5m, 2/5m minus 1/5. And we're done. We've simplified that as much as we can.."
Math,"So because if you take the product of two and six, you get 12, we could say that two is a factor of 12, we could also say that six is a factor of 12. You take the product of these things and you get 12! You could even say that this is 12 in factored form. People don't really talk that way but you could think of it that way. We broke 12 into the things that we could use to multiply."
Math,"And you probably remember from earlier mathematics the notion of prime factorization, where you break it up into all of the prime factors. So in that case you could break the six into a two and a three, and you have two times two times three is equal to 12. And you'd say, ""Well, this would be 12 ""in prime factored form or the prime factorization of 12,"" so these are the prime factors. And so the general idea, this notion of a factor is things that you can multiply together to get your original thing."
Math,"Or if you're talking about factored form, you're essentially taking the number and you're breaking it up into the things that when you multiply them together, you get your original number. What we're going to do now is extend this idea into the algebraic domain."
Math,"So if we start with an expression, let's say the expression is two plus four X, can we break this up into the product of two either numbers or two expressions or the product of a number and an expression? Well, one thing that might jump out at you is we can write this as two times one plus two X. And you can verify if you like that this does indeed equal two plus four X. We're just going to distribute the two. Two times one is two, two times two X is equal to four X, so plus four X."
Math,"So in our algebra brains, this will often be reviewed as or referred to as this expression factored or in a factored form. Sometimes people would say that we have factored out the two. You could just as easily say that you have factored out a one plus two X. You have broken this thing up into two of its factors. So let's do a couple of examples of this and then we'll think about, you know, I just told you that we could write it this way but how do you actually figure that out? So let's do another one."
Math,"Let's say that you had, I don't know, let's say you had, six, let me just in a different color, let's say you had six X six X plus three, no, let's write it six X plus 30, that's interesting. So one way to think about it is can we break up each of these terms so that they have a common factor? Well, this one over here, six X literally represents six times X, and then 30, if I want to break out a six, 30 is divisible by six, so I could write this as six times five, 30 is the same thing as six times five."
Math,"And when you write it this way, you see, ""Hey, I can factor out a six!"" Essentially, this is the reverse of the distributive property! So I'm essentially undoing the distributive property, taking out the six, and you are going to end up with, so if you take out the six, you end up with six times, so if you take out the six here, you have an X, and you take out the six here, you have plus five. So six X plus 30, if you factor it, we could write it as six times X plus five."
Math,"And you can verify with the distributive property. If you distribute this six, you get six X + five times six or six X + 30. Let's do something that's a little bit more interesting where we might want to factor out a fraction. So let's say we had the situation ... Let me get a new color here. So let's say we had 1/2 minus 3/2, minus 3/2 X."
Math,"How could we write this in a, I guess you could say, in a factored form, or if we wanted to factor out something? I encourage you to pause the video and try to figure it out, and I'll give you a hint. See if you can factor out 1/2. Let's write it that way. If we're trying to factor out 1/2, we can write this first term as 1/2 times one and this second one we could write as minus 1/2 times three X. That's what this is, 3/2 X is the same thing as three X divided by two or 1/2 times three X."
Math,"And then here we can see that we can just factor out the 1/2 and you're going to get 1/2 times one minus three X. Another way you could have thought about it is, ""Hey, look, both of these are products ""involving 1/2,"" and that's a little bit more confusing when you're dealing with a fraction here. But one way to think about it is, I can divide out a 1/2 from each of these terms. So if I divide out a 1/2 from this, 1/2 divided by 1/2 is one."
Math,"And if I take 3/2 and divide it by 1/2, that's going to be three, and so I took out a 1/2, that's another way to think about it. I don't know if that confuses you more or it confuses you less, but hopefully this gives you the sense of what factoring an expression is. I'll do another example, where we're even using more abstract things, so I could say, ""AX plus AY."" How could we write this in factored form? Well, both of these terms have products of A in it, so I could write this as A times X plus Y."
Math,"And sometimes you'll hear people say, ""You have factored out the A,"" and you can verify it if you multiply this out again. If you distribute the A, you'd be left with AX plus AY.."
Math,"We're essentially going to be reversing the distributive property. So for example, what is the largest number that is-- or I could really say the largest expression-- that is divisible into both 4x and 18? Well, 4x is divisible by 2, because we know that 4 is divisible by 2. And 18 is also divisible by 2, so we can rewrite 4x as being 2 times 2x. If you multiply that side, it's obviously going to be 4x. And then, we can write 18 as the same thing as 2 times 9."
Math,"And now it might be clear that when you apply the distributive property, you'll usually end up with a step that looks something like this. Now we're just going to undistribute the two right over We're going to factor the two out. Let me actually just draw that. So we're going to factor the two out, and so this is going to be 2 times 2x plus 9. And if you were to-- wanted to multiply this out, it would be 2 times 2x plus 2 times 9. It would be exactly this, which you would simplify as this, right up here."
Math,"So there we have it. We have written this as the product of two expressions, 2 times 2x plus 9. Let's do this again. So let's say that I have 12 plus-- let me think of something interesting-- 32x. Actually since we-- just to get a little bit of variety here, let's put a y here, 12 plus 32y. Well, what's the largest number that's divisible into both 12 and 32? 2 is clearly divisible into both, but so is 4. And let's see. It doesn't look like anything larger than 4 is divisible into both 12 and 32."
Math,"The greatest common factor of 12 and 32 is 4, and y is only divisible into the second term, not into this first term right over here. So it looks like 4 is the greatest common factor. So we could rewrite each of these as a product of 4 and something else. So for example, 12, we can rewrite as 4 times 3. And 32, we can rewrite-- since it's going to be plus-- 4 times. Well if you divide 32y by 4, it's going to be 8y. And now once again, we can factor out the 4. So this is going to be 4 times 3 plus 8y."
Math,"And once you do more and more examples of this, you're going to find that you can just do this stuff all at once. You can say hey, what's the largest number that's divisible into both of these? Well, it's 4, so let me factor a 4 out. 12 divided by 4 is 3. 32y divided by 4 is 8y.."
Math,"So I'm assuming you've had a go at it. So the way I like to tackle it is just to simplify all of them as much as possible. So this one up here is clearly not that simplified. So let's distribute this two. So if I distribute the two, what does it become? This is equal to two times negative six-C, is negative 12-C. Two times positive three is positive six. And then we have plus four-C, plus four-C. And then we can simplify it further cause I have both of these terms that involve C."
Math,"I have negative 12-C plus four-C. So what's that going to be? Negative 12 of something plus four of something is going to be negative eight of that something. So this is going to be equal to negative eight-C. So these two blue terms when I add them, I'm going to get negative eight-C. And then finally plus six. Plus six. Now just doing that that's exactly what this first green expression is. So this one is definitely, this one is definitely going to be equivalent."
Math,"Now what about this one down here? Well to figure that out let's simplify it. So let's distribute the three. Three times negative four-C is negative 12-C. Three times positive two is positive six. So plus six and then we have the plus four-C over there. It's lookin' good. And then we can add the terms that involve C. Negative 12-C and four-C, you add those together, you're gonna get negative eight-C. Negative eight-C plus six. Plus six, which is exactly what these other ones are."
Math,"So all of these, all of these expressions, are actually equivalent. This one, that one, and that one. Let's do another example. And just like the last time pause the video and see which of these two expressions, it could be both of them or it could be none of them, or it could be one of them. Which of them, if any, are equivalent to this yellow expression? Alright let's do it together. And like before let's just simplify it."
Math,"So the first thing my brain wants to do is let's take the terms involving N and add those together. So negative six of something, in this case N, plus four of that something, in that case N. So negative six-N plus four-N that's gonna leave you with negative two of that something. You add the coefficients. Negative six plus four is negative two Ns. So we have negative two-N, and then plus negative 12, that's the same thing as just minus 12. So minus, minus 12. So I simplified our original expression."
Math,"Let's see these ones, these down here. So if I distribute the four, if I distribute the four I get four times N is four-N. And then four times negative three is minus 12. And then we are going to subtract six-N. So minus six-N. So what does this give us? We get, let me get another color here. So we have four-N, I'm adding all the terms with N, minus six-N, that's gonna give us negative two-N. And then we have the minus 12. And then we have the minus 12."
Math,"So this expression when I simplify it got me the exact same place as the first expression. So these two, these two are equivalent. This is equivalent to that. Now let's check this one out. So two, let me just distribute, let me just distribute the two. Two times two-N is four-N. And then two times negative six is negative 12. So this simplified to four-N minus 12 which is clearly different than negative two-N minus 12. So this one, this one, is not the same as the other two.."
Math,"Match the expressions to their meaning for Handsome Jack. And they say multiple expressions may fit the same description. So in this bucket, we have the price of the diamond pony before tax. Well, they already tell us that the price of the diamond pony is P dollars. So that's P right over here. Now over here, they say the amount of tax Handsome Jack Well, he pays a 25% diamond pony tax. So whatever the price is, he's going to pay 25% of that."
Math,"Or another way of thinking about it, he's going to pay 25% is the same thing as 0.25. So 0.25 times P is the amount of tax he's going to pay on this diamond pony. Now, they say Handsome Jack's total bill for the diamond pony. Well, he's going to pay P for the pony plus 0.25P in taxes. So that is this one right over here. P for the pony plus 0.25P for the taxes. So that's that one over there. But if we look at this, you could view this literally as 1P plus 0.25P's. Well, that's the same thing as 1.25P."
Math,"So that's the same thing as this right over here. So it's 1.25P. And these other three don't seem to fit in any of these categories. So I'm going to put it into the not used. We're required to categorize everything. So let me put this in the not used. It's falling off the screen, I realize. Let me put this in the not used. And then let me put this in the not used. Let's check our answer. We got it right.."
Math,"So one of Martin's bouquets has 3 violets and 4 tulips. So the 3 violets are going to cost 3 times the price of the violet, which is V. So that's the cost of the violets, 3V. And then the 4 tulips are going to cost 4 times the price of a tulip. So that's 4T. So it's 3V plus 4T. So it's not this one. Let's see. This one right over here, this is 4T plus 3V. So this is the price of 4 tulips, 4 times the price of a tulip, plus 3 times the price of a violet."
Math,"The price of 3 of Martin's bouquets, so it's essentially going to be 3 times this quantity right over here. This is the price of 1 bouquet. We want 3 of them. So it's going to be 3 times the quantity 4T plus 3V. And let's see. If I were to actually multiply this out, 3 times 4T is 12T, and then plus 3 times 3V is 9V. So this is the same thing if I were to distribute the 3-- is 12T plus 9V. Well, that's this right over here. These two are equivalent expressions. And let's see."
Math,"Are any of these other things equivalent? No, this says 3 times 3T plus 4V. So I'm going to put this in the not used bucket. And then I have-- let's see-- 3V plus 2T. I'm going to put it in the not used bucket. And let's see. This has 2V plus 4T plus V. So if I were to simplify this, if I were to combine the V terms-- if I have two V's and I add another V, that's three V's plus 4T. So this is actually the same thing as the price of 1 of Martin's bouquets."
Math,So you could view this as the price of 2 violets plus the price of 4 tulips plus another violet. So it's really the price of 3 violets and 4 tulips. So let's check our answer. We got it right..
Math,"Alright, so we're talking about the cost of the visit. So you're gonna spend $50 no matter what. And then you're gonna get an additional charge of $100 per cavity it tells us. An additional charge of $100 per cavity. So lets see, if you have n cavities it's gonna be $100 times n. I can just write this as 100n. Now lets see if this makes sense. If you have no cavities, if n is zero, then you're just gonna pay your $50. But if you have one cavity, you're gonna pay your $50 plus 100 times one."
Math,"If you have two cavities, you're gonna pay $50 plus 100 times 2, yeah. This seems to make sense. So lets check our answer. We got it right, lets do another one of these. Sunny earns $12 per hour delivering cakes. She worked of x hours this week. She worked for X hours this week. Unfortunately, she was charged $15 for a late delivery on Tuesday. How much money did Sunny earn this week? So if you see that she earns $12 per hour and she worked for x hours. Okay, she got $12 per hour times x hours."
Math,"So that's how much she would've made except for the fact that she also had, she was charged, I guess her employer, charges her for late delivery. So she had to take $15 out of her paychecks. So this is what she would've gotten paid based on her hourly wage and the number of hours she worked. But then she has that late fee that she has to pay. So it's gonna be 12 x minus 15 is how much she actually earned this week. Lets do a few more of these. There are c players on the Cougars hockey team."
Math,"The team scored a total of 36 goals this season. One of the players, Matthew, scored two more goals than the average per player. How many goals did Matthew score? Alright, well lets think about the average per player. Cause we know that he scored two more than the average player. So the average is going to be the total number of goals divided by the number of players. And they tell us that they're c players."
Math,"So this expression right over here, that will tell us the average, that that's the average goals per player. Now we know Matthew scored two more than this thing over here. So we can just add two to that. And that's how many goals Matthew scores. Lets check our answer. Now the key here, this might seem a little confusing, but remember, this says Matthew scored two more goals. Two more goals than the average player. The average player, the average goals per player is 36 divided by c."
Math,"Lets do one more of these. Hannah has 127 books in her collection. Her school is hosting a book donation. There are z students at her school and they each plan to donate the same amount of books and reach a total donation of 300 books. How many books will Hannah have in her collection after her donation? Alright, so lets think about it. Hannah has 127 books in her collection. That's how much she has in her collection. Her school is hosting a book donation."
Math,"There's z students at her school and they each plan to donate the same amount of books and reach a total of 300 books. How many books will Hannah have in her collection after her donation? So 127, and I know I just reread it cause that first time I was like, okay wait, is 127 the amount of books that Hannah has or the amount that her school has would be very clear. 127 is the number of book Hannah has. Then she's gonna donate some of those books. So she's gonna donate some of those books to her school."
Math,"And we have to figure out how much is she going to donate to her school. And we see that the students, the z students plan on together, they each want to donate the same number of books and together they're gonna donate 300 books. So how much is each student going to donate? Well, if z students together are donating 300, each student is going to donate 300 divided by z. 300 divided by z. And so Hannah starts with 127 books. She's going to donate her share of books to the school."
Math,And each student is going to donate 300 divided by z books. So Hannah is going to be left with 127 minus 300 over z books after her donation..
Math,"It's a big question mark on this blue mass right over here. And we also have a bunch of 1-- I guess we could call them 1-kilogram masses. So these are all each a 1-kilogram mass. And my question to you is, what could we do to either side of this scale in order to figure out what the mystery mass is? Or maybe we can't figure it out at all."
Math,"Is there something that we can do, either removing or adding these things, so that we can figure out what this mystery mass is? And I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about that. Well, to figure out what this mystery mass is, we essentially just want this on one side of this scale. But that by itself isn't enough."
Math,"We could just remove these 3, but that won't do the job, because if we just remove these 3, then the left-hand side of the scale is clearly going to have less mass, and it's going to go up, and the right side is going to go down. And that's not going to give as much information. It's just going to tell us that this blue thing has a lower mass than what's over here. So just removing this won't help us much. It won't let us know that this is equal to that."
Math,"Well, what we've got to do if we want to keep the scale balanced is we've got to remove the same amount of mass from both sides of the scale. So if we want to remove 3 things here-- so let me try my best to remove 3 things here. If we want to remove 3-- let me do it like this. I'll just color on it. I'll just erase it. So if we want to remove 3 things there, if we did this by itself, just removed these 3 things, then the two sides would not have an equal mass anymore."
Math,"This side over here would have a lower mass. So we've got to remove 3 from both sides. So if we really want to make sure that our scale is balanced, we've got to remove 3 from both sides. And so if we started off with the scales balanced and then we removed 3 from both sides, the scale will still be balanced. And then when we do that, we have a clearer idea of what the mass of this object actually is. Now, when we remove 3 from both sides, the scale will still be balanced."
Math,"And we know that this mass is equal to whatever's left over here. It's equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And if we're assuming they're kilograms, we'll know that the question mark mass is equal to 7 kilograms, that this right over here is a 7-kilogram mass.."
Math,"I will give you a few seconds to think about it... So let's think about what we have on the left side: we have 3 masses with mass X, so you can say we have 3x and then we have 2 masses of 1 kilogram, so in total we have 2 kg. So + 2. So one way to think about the total mass on the left-hand side is 3x + 2. Three masses with mass X, plus two kilograms. That is what we have on the left-hand side. Now, let us think about what we have on the right-hand side."
Math,"We can simply count them: [counts to 14] Fourteen blocks, each has a mass of 1 kg, so the total mass will be 14 kg. And we see that the scale is balanced, not tilting down or upwards. So this mass over here must be equal to this total mass. The scale is balanced, so we can write an 'equal'-sign."
Math,"(let me do that in a white coulour, I do not like that brown) Now, what I want you to think about, and you can think about it either through the symbols or through the scales, is: how would you go about -- let us think about a few things: how would you first go about at least getting rid of these little 1kg blocks? I will give you a second to think about that..."
Math,"Well, the simplest thing is: you can take these 1kg blocks off of the left-hand side, but remember, if you just took these blocks off of the left-hand side, and it was balanced before, now the left-hand side will be lighter and it will move up. But we want to keep it balanced so we can keep saying 'equal'. That this mass is equal to that mass. So, if we remove 2 block from the left-hand side, we need to remove 2 from the right-hand side. So, we can remove two there, and then we can remove two over there."
Math,"Mathematically, what we are doing is: we are subtracting 2 kilograms from each side. We are subtracting 2 from this side, So on the left-hand side we now have 3x + 2, minus 2 we are left with just 3x, and on the right-hand side we had 14 and we took away 2 (let me write this:) we took away 2, so we are going to be left with 12 blocks. And you see that there, the ones that I have not crossed out, there are 12 left, and here you have 3 of those X-blocks."
Math,"Since we removed the same amount from both sides, our scale is still balanced. And our equation: 3x is now equal to 12. Now, this turns into a problem very similar to what we saw in the last video, so now I ask you: what can we do to isolate one x, to only have one 'X' on the left-hand side of the scale, while keeping the scale balanced? The easiest way to think about it is: If I want one X on this left-hand side, that is a third of the total X's here."
Math,"So what if I were to multiply the left-hand side by one-third -- -- but if I want to keep the scale balanced, I have to multiply the right-hand side by one-third. If we can do that mathematically, Over here I can multiply the left-hand side by 1/3, and if I want to keep my scale balanced I also have to multiply the right-hand side by 1/3. Multiplying it physically literally means: just keeping a third of what we had originally We would get rid of two of these."
Math,"If we want to keep a third of what we had here originally, -- there are 12 blocks left over after removing those first two -- so, 1/3 of 12: we are only going to have four of these little 1kg boxes left. Let me remove all but four. (so, remove those, and those...) And I have left [counts them] 4 here. And so, what you are left with, the only thing you have left, is this 'X' - I will shade it in to show this is the one we actually have left - and then we have these 1 kilogram boxes."
Math,"You see it mathematically over here: 1/3 * 3x -- or you could have said 3x divided by 3 -- either way, that gives us -- these threes cancel out, so that would give you an 'X' and on the right-hand side: 12 * 1/3 - which is the same as 12/3, is equal to 4. And, since we did the same thing to both sides, the scale is still balanced. So you see that the mass of this thing must be the same as the mass of these 4 left-over blocks. x must be equal to 4 kilograms.."
Math,"If it was just 3x is equal to 17, you could divide both sides by 3, and you'd get your answer. But now this 5 seems to mess things up a little bit. Now, before we even solve it, let's think about what it's saying. Let's solve it kind of in a tangible way, then we'll solve it using operations that hopefully will make sense after that. So 3 times x literally means-- so let me write it over here. So we have 3 times x. So we literally have an x plus an x plus an x. That right there is a 3x."
Math,"And then that's plus 5, and I'm actually going to write it out as five objects. So plus 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This right here, this 3x plus 5, is equal to 17. So let me write the equal sign. Now, let me draw 17 objects here. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Now, these two things are equal, so anything you do to this side, you have to do to that side. If we were to get rid of one object here, you'd want to get rid of one object there in order for the equality to still be true."
Math,"Now, what can we do to both sides of this equation so we can get it in the form that we're used to, where we only have a 3x on the left-hand side, where we don't have this 5? Well, ideally, we would just get rid of these five objects here. You would literally get rid of these five objects: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But, like I said, if the original thing was equal to the original thing on the right, if we get rid of five objects from the left-hand side, we have to get rid of five objects from the right-hand side."
Math,"So we have to do it here, too: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Now, what is a symbolic way of representing taking away five things? Well, you're subtracting 5 from both sides of this equation. So that's what we're doing here when we took away 5 from the left and from the right. So we're subtracting 5 from the left. That's what we did here. And we're also subtracting 5 from the right. Do that right over there. Now, what does the left-hand side of the equation now become? The left-hand side, you have 5 minus 5."
Math,"These cancel out. You're just left with the 3x. It's a different shade of green. You are just left with the 3x. The 5 and the negative 5 canceled out. And you see that here. When you got rid of these five objects, we were just left with the 3x's. This right here is the 3x. And the whole reason why we subtracted 5 is because we wanted this 5 to go away."
Math,"Now, what does the right-hand side of the equation look like? So it's 3x is going to be-- let me write the equality sign right under it-- is equal to-- or you could either just do it mathematically. Say, OK, 17 minus 5. 17 minus 5 is 12. Or you could just count over here. I had 17 things. I took away 5. I have 12 left: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. That's what's subtraction is. It's just taking away five things. So now we have it in a pretty straightforward form. 3x is equal to 12."
Math,"All we have to do is divide both sides of this equation by 3. So we're just left with an x on the left-hand side. So we divide by-- let me pick a nicer color than that. Let me do this pink color. So you divide the left-hand side by 3, the right-hand side by 3. And remember what that's equivalent to. The left-hand side, none of this stuff exists anymore, so we should ignore it. None of this stuff exists anymore. In fact, let me clear it out, just so that we don't even have to look at it."
Math,"We subtracted it, so let me clear it. Let me clear it over here. Let me clear it over here. And so now we are dividing both sides by 3. Divide the left-hand side by 3. It's 1, 2, 3. So three groups, each of them have an x in it. If you divide this right-hand side by 3, you have 1, 2 and 3. So it's three groups of four. So when you do it mathematically here, the 3's cancel out. 3 times something divided by 3 is just the something. So you're left with x is equal to, and then 12 divided by 3 is 4."
Math,"You get x is equal to 4, and you get that exact same thing over here. When you divided 3x into groups of three, each of the groups had an x in it. When you divided 12 into groups of three, each of the groups have a 4 in it, so x must be equal to 4. x is equal to 4. Let's do another one, and this time I won't draw it all out like this, but hopefully, you'll see that the same type of processes are involved. Let's say I have-- let me scroll down a little bit. Let's say I have 7x."
Math,"So 7x-- and I'll do a slightly more complicated one this time. 7x minus 2 is equal to-- I'll make the numbers not work out nice and clean-- is equal to negative 10. Now, this all of a sudden becomes a lot more-- you know, we have a negative sign. We have a negative over here, but we're going to do the exact same thing. The first thing we want to do if we want to get the left-hand side simplified to just 7x is we want to get rid of this negative 2."
Math,"And what can we add or subtract to both sides of the equation to get rid of this negative 2? Well, if we add 2 to the left-hand side, these two guys will cancel out. But remember, this is equal to that. If we want the equality to still hold, if we add 2 to the left-hand side, we also have to do it to the right-hand side. So what is the new left-hand side going to be equal to? So we have 7x, negative 2 plus 2 is just 0. I could write plus 0, or I could just write nothing there, and I'll just write nothing."
Math,"So we get 7x is equal to-- now, what's negative 10 plus 2? And this is a little bit of review of adding and subtracting negative numbers. Remember. I'll draw the number line here for you. If I draw the number line-- so this is 9, this is 1. We could keep going in the positive direction. Negative 10 is out here. Negative 10, negative 9, negative 8, negative 7. There's a bunch of numbers here. You know, dot, dot, dot."
Math,"I don't have space to draw them all, but we're starting at negative 10, and we're adding 2 to it, so we're moving in the positive direction on the number lines. So we're going 1, 2. So it's negative 8. Don't get confused. Don't say, OK, 10 plus 2 is 12, so negative 10 plus 2 is negative 12. Negative 10 minus 2 would be negative 12 because you'd be going more negative. Here, we have a negative number, but we're going to the right. We're going in the positive direction, so this is negative 8."
Math,"So we have 7x is equal to negative 8. So now you might be saying, well, how do I do this type of a problem? You know, I have a negative number here. You do it the exact same way. If we want to just have an x on the left-hand side, we have to divide the left-hand side by 7, so that the 7x divided by 7, just the 7's cancel out, you're left with x. So let's do that. If you divide by 7, those cancel out, but you can't just do it to the left-hand side."
Math,"Anything you do to the left, you have to do to the right in order for the equality to still hold true. So let's divide the right by 7 as well. And we are left with just an x is equal to negative 8 divided by 7. We could work it out. It'll be some type of a decimal, if you were to use a calculator, or you could just leave it in fraction form. Negative 8 divided by 7 is negative 8/7."
Math,"Negative 8/7, or if you want to write it as a mixed number, x is equal to 7 goes into 8 one time and has a remainder of 1, so it's negative 1 and 1/7. Either one would be acceptable.."
Math,"rid of this 2. And the best way to get rid of that 2 is to subtract it. But if we want to subtract it from the right-hand side, we also have to subtract it from the left-hand side, because this is an equation. If this is equal to that, anything we do to that, we also have to do to this. So let's subtract 2 from both sides. So you subtract 2 from the right, subtract 2 from the left, and we get, on the left-hand side, negative 16 minus 2 is negative 18. And then that is equal to x over 4."
Math,"And then we have positive 2 minus 2, which is just going to be 0, so we don't even have to write that. I could write just a plus 0, but I think that's a little unnecessary. And so we have negative 18 is equal to x over 4. And our whole goal here is to isolate the x, to solve for the x. And the best way we can do that, if we have x over 4 here, if we multiply that by 4, we're just going to have an x. So we can multiply that by 4, but once again, this is an equation."
Math,"Anything you do to the right-hand side, you have to do to the left-hand side, and vice versa. So if we multiply the right-hand side by 4, we also have to multiply the left-hand side by 4. So we get 4 times negative 18 is equal to x over 4, times 4. The x over 4 times 4, that cancels out. You divide something by 4 and multiply by 4, you're just going to be left with an x. And on the other side, 4 times negative 18. Let's see, that's 40. Well, let's just write it out. So 18 times 4."
Math,"If we were to multiply 18 times 4, 4 times 8 is 32. 4 times 1 is 4, plus 1 is 72. But this is negative 18 times 4, so it's negative 72. So x is equal to negative 72. And if we want to check it, we can just substitute it back into that original equation. So let's do that. Let's substitute this into the original equation. So the original equation was negative 16 is equal to-- instead of writing x, I'm going to write negative 72-- is equal to negative 72 over 4 plus 2. Let's see if this is actually true."
Math,"So this right-hand side simplifies to negative 72 divided by 4. We already know that that is negative 18. So this is equal to negative 18 plus 2. This is what the equation becomes. And then the right-hand side, negative 18 plus 2, that's negative 16. So it all comes out true. This right-hand side, when x is equal to negative 72, does indeed equal negative 16.."
Math,"We have negative 1/3 = j/4 - 10/3. So I encourage you to pause the video and see if you could solve for j. What j would make this equation true? Alright. Now let's work through this together. So what I like to do, I like to isolate the variable that I'm trying to solve for on one side. Since it's already on the right-hand side, let's try to get all the things that involve j on the right-hand side, and then get rid of everything else on the right-hand side."
Math,"So I want to get rid of this negative 10/3, and the best way I can think of doing that is by adding 10/3. Now I can't just do that to one side of the equation. Then it wouldn't be equal anymore. If this is equal to that, in order for the quantity to be true, whatever I do to this I have to do to that as well. So I have to add 10/3 to both sides. I have to add 10/3 to both sides of the equation. And so what am I going to get? On the left-hand side, I'm going to have negative 1/3 + 10/3, which is 9/3."
Math,"And then that's going to be equal to. And on the right-hand side, the negative 10/3 and the positive 10/3, those cancel out to get a zero, and I'm just left with j/4. It's equal to j/4. Now you might recognize 9/3, that's the same thing as nine divided by three. So this is just going to be three. So that simplifies a little bit. Three, let me just rewrite it so you don't get confused. Three is equal to j/4. Now, to solve for j, I could just multiply both sides by four."
Math,"'Cause if I divide something by four and then multiply by four, I'm just going to be left with that something. If I start with j and I divide by four, and then I multiply, and then I multiply by four, so I'm just going to multiply by four, then I'm just going to be left with j on the right-hand side. But I can't just multiply the right-hand side by four. I have to do it with the left-hand side as well. So I multiply the left-hand side by four as well."
Math,"And what I will be left with, four times three is twelve. And then j divided by four times four, well that's just going to be j. So we get j is equal to 12. And the neat thing about equations is you can verify that you indeed got the right answer. You can substitute 12 for j here, and verify that negative 1/3 is equal to 12/4 - 10/3. Does this actually work out? Well 12/4 is the same thing as three, and if I wanted to write that as thirds, this is the same thing as 9/3."
Math,"And 9/3 - 10/3 is indeed equal to negative 1/3. So we feel very good about that. Let's do another example. So I have n/5 + 0.6 = 2. So let's isolate this term that involves n on the left-hand side. So let's get rid of this 0.6. So let's subtract 0.6 from the left-hand side. But I can't just do it from the left. I have to do it from both sides if I want the equality to hold true. So, subtract 0.6."
Math,"Now on the left-hand side, I'm just going to be left with n/5, and on the right-hand side, 2 - 0.6, that;'s going to be 1.4. And if you don't want to do this in your head, you could work this out separately. It's going to be 2.0 - 0.6. You could say, ""Oh, this is 20/10-6/10"" which is going to be 14/10, which is that there. Or if you want to do it a little bit kind of the traditional method, you say, ""Oh, I'm trying to subtract six from zero, let me re-group."" That's going to be a 10."
Math,"I'm going to take from the ones place. If I take a one from the one's place, and that's going to be equal to 10/10. 10/10 - 6/10 is 4/10. And then, bring down one one minus zero ones is just one. So it's 1.4. And now, to solve for n. Well on the left have n being divided by five. If I just want n here, I can just multiply by five. So, if I multiply by five, five times n divided by five is going to be just n. But I can't just multiply the left-hand side by five."
Math,"I have to multiply the right-hand side by five as well. And so what is that going to get us? We are going to get n = 1.4 x 5. 1.4 x 5. Now you might be able to do this in your head, 'cause this is one and 2/5. So this thing should all be equal to seven, but I'll just do it this way as well. Five times four is 20. Re-group the two. One times five is five plus two is seven. And when I look at all the numbers that I'm multiplying, I have one digit to the right of the decimal point."
Math,"So my answer will have one digit to the right of the decimal point. So it's 7.0, or just 7. n = 7. And you can verify this works, 'cause seven divided by five is going to be equal to 1.4, plus 0.6 is equal to two. Let's do one more example. This is too much fun. Alright. 0.5 times the whole quantity (r + 2.75) = 3. Now there's a bunch of ways that you could tackle this."
Math,"A lot of times when you see something like this, your temptation might be, ""Let's distribute the 0.5."" But that makes it a little bit hairy, 'cause 0.5 times 2.75. You could calculate that, and you will get the right answer if you do it correctly. But a simpler thing might be, well, let's just divide both sides by 0.5. That way I'm going to get more whole numbers involved. So if I divide. Remember, whatever I do to the left-hand side I have to do to the right-hand side."
Math,"And the way my brain thought about it was, well, if I divide by 0.5 on the left-hand side I can get rid of this. And if I divide by 0.5 on the right-hand side I'm still going to get an integer. Three divided by 0.5 is six. It's the same thing as three divided by a half. How many halves fit into three? Six halves fit into three. So this going to be six right over here. So these cancel out. And then this is going to be equal to six."
Math,"So the whole thing is simplified now to r + 2.75 is going to be equal to is equal to six. And now to just isolate the r on the left-hand side, I can substract the 2.75 from the left. But, like we've seen multiple times, I can't just do it from, I can't just do it from the left. I'm having, my brain is malfunctioning. I can't just do it from the left. I have to do it from the right as well."
Math,"So this simplifies to r, this simplifies to r, Is equal to -- what's six minus 2.75? Well if you want to do it in your head, six minus two would be four, and then if you take 0.75 from that it would be 3.25. If you don't feel comfortable doing it in your head, we could just write it out. 6.00 - 2.75, be careful to align the decimals and then I've got to do some re-grouping. Let's see, I have zero hundreds, trying to subtract five hundreds. That's not going to work out."
Math,"So I try to re-group from here, but I have nothing here. So let me re-group from here. One one. Let me take away one of these ones. I'm going to have five ones. And then that's going to be equivalent, so I have five ones here, and that one one I took away is going to be ten tenths. And then I can take one of those tenths away. So I'm going to have nine tenths. And that's going to be ten hundredths. And now I could subtract. Ten hundreths minus five hundredths is five hundredths."
Math,"Nine tenths minus seven tenths is two tenths. My decimal is going to be there. Five minus two is three. And you can verify that. 3.25 + 2.75 is six, times 0.5 is indeed equal to three. So we feel, once again, really good about this.."
Math,"But as long as you do legitimate steps, as long as anything you do to the left-hand side, you also do to the right-hand side, you should move in the correct direction, or you shouldn't get the wrong answer. So let's do a couple of these. So the first one says-- I'll rewrite it-- 1.3 times x minus 0.7 times x is equal to 12. Well, here the first thing that my instinct is to do, is to merge these two terms. Because I have 1.3 of something minus 0.7 of that same something. This is the same variable."
Math,"If I have 1.3 apples minus 0.7 apples, well, why don't I subtract 0.7 from 1.3? And I will get 1.3 minus 0.7 x's, or apples, or whatever you want to call them. So is equal to 12. You could imagine that I did the reverse distributive property out here. I factored out an x. But the way my head thinks about it is, I have 1.3 of something minus 0.7 of something, that's going to be equal to 1.3 minus 0.7 of those somethings, that x. And of course 1.3 minus 0.7 is 0.6 times x of my somethings is equal to 12."
Math,"And now, this looks just like one of the problems we did in the last video. We have a coefficient times x is equal to some other number. Well, let's divide both sides of this equation by that coefficient. Divide both sides by 0.6. So the left-hand side will just become an x. X is equal to-- and what is 12 divided by 0.6? 0.6 goes into 12-- let's add some decimal points here-- that's the same thing as 6 going into 120. 6 goes into 12. 2 times 2, times 6 is 12. Subtract, you get a 0. 6 goes into 0 0 times."
Math,"So it's going to go 20 times. 12 divided by 0.6 is 20. And we can verify. Let's verify this. 1.3, let's substitute it back. 1.3 times 20, minus 0.7, times 20. Let's verify that that is equal to 12. So I'll take the calculator out, just so you don't have to trust my math. So we have 1.3 times 20 is equal to 26. So this piece right here is 26. And then 0.7 times 20. I don't need a calculator for that. That is 14. 26 minus 14 is 12. So it checks out. We got the right answer for this equation."
Math,"x is equal to 20. Let's do this one right here. 5x minus 3x plus 2 is equal to 1. This looks very complicated. And whenever something looks daunting, just do steps that look like they're simplifying the equation. And over time, as long as you do legitimate steps, you should be able to make some progress. So the first thing I want to do, is I want to distribute this negative 1 over here. So this is the same thing as 5x minus 3x, minus 2. Right? I just did the distributive property on the 3x and the 2."
Math,"This is a negative 1 times 3x plus 2. So it's negative 1 times 3x, plus negative 1 times 2. Or negative 3x minus 2. And that is going to be equal to 1. Now, I have 5 of something minus 3 of that same something. So that's going to be equal to 2 of that something. 5x minus 3x is 2x. 5 minus 3 is 2. And then I have the minus 2 is equal to 1. And now, I like to get into the form where I have 2x, or I have something times x is equal to something. So I want to get rid of this negative 2 on the left-hand side."
Math,"The best way I know how to do that is to add 2 to both sides. So add a 2 on the left-hand side. If I do it to the left-hand side, I've got to do it to the right-hand side. Plus 2 on the right-hand side. These two guys will cancel out, and you're going to get 2x is equal to 1 plus 2, is equal to 3. And now you can divide both sides by 2, and you get x is equal to 3/2. And I'll leave it for you to verify that this is indeed the correct answer."
Math,"Let me draw a little line here so that our work doesn't get messy, although that might have made it even messier. So here we have to solve for s. And look, we have a fraction and 2 s terms. How do we do that? Well, just do it the same way. We have 1 times s minus-- you can view this as 3/8 times s is equal to 5/6. You could view this as 1 times s, minus 3/8 times s is equal to 5/6. You could factor out an s, if you like. Maybe I'll do it this way. I'll factor it onto the left-hand side."
Math,"This is the same thing as s times 1, minus 3/8 is equal to 5/6. And 1 minus 3/8, what is that? That 1, I can rewrite as 8/8. That's 1. So this is the same thing as 8/8 minus 3/8 is 5/8, times s. You could switch the order of multiplication. 5/8 times s is equal to 5/6. And you might be able to go straight from that. If I have 1 of something minus 3/8 of that something, I have 8/8 of that something minus 3/8 of that something, I'm going to have 5/8 of that something."
Math,"And now, to solve for s, I can multiply both sides by the inverse of this coefficient. So I multiply 8 over 5 times 5/8s. If I do it to the left-hand side, I have to do it to the right-hand side. 8 over 5. I multiplied by 8 over 5 so that those cancel out and those cancel out. And you are left with s is equal to-- right, this is just a 1-- is equal to-- well, the 5's we can divide. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 5. Divide the numerator by 2 and the denominator by 2."
Math,"You're left with-- sorry, divide the denominator by 2, you get 6 divided by 2 is 3. You're left with 4/3. s is equal to 4/3. Let's do one more of these. So here I have 5 times q minus 7 over 12 is equal to 2/3. So let me write this. And I could rewrite this as just 5 over 12 times q minus 7 is equal to 2/3. And what I want to do with this video, is to show you that I can do it two different ways. But as long as I do legitimate operations, I should get the same answer."
Math,"So the first way I'm going to do it, is I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation by the inverse of 5/12. So I'm going to multiply both sides by 12 over 5. Because I wanted to get rid of this 5/12 on the left-hand side. It makes everything look a little bit messy. And I multiply it by 12 over 5, because these are going to cancel out. The 5 and the 5 cancel out, the 12 and the 12 cancel out. So the left-hand side of my equation becomes q minus 7 is equal to the right-hand side, 2/3 times 5/12."
Math,"If you divide the 12 by 3, you get a 4. You divide the 3 by 3, you get a 1. So 2 times 4 is 8 over 5. And now we can add 7 to both sides of this equation. So let's add-- I want to do that in a different color-- add 7 to both sides of this equation. These two 7's cancel out. That was the whole point of adding the 7. And you are left with q is equal to 8/5 plus 7. Or we could write 8/5 plus 7 can be written as 35/5. And so this is going to be equal to 8-- well, the denominator is 5. 8 plus 35 is 43."
Math,"So my answer, going this way, is q is equal to 43/5. And I said I would do it two ways. Let's do it another way. So let me write the same problem down. So I have 5/12-- actually, let me just do it a completely different way. Let me write it the way they wrote it. 5 times q minus 7, over 12 is equal to 2/3. Let me just get rid of the 12 first. Let me multiply both sides of this equation by 12. I just don't like that 12 sitting there, so I'm going to multiply both sides by 12."
Math,"So these are going to cancel out, and you're going to be left with 5 times q minus 7 is equal to 2/3 times 12. That's the same thing as 24 over 3. So this is, let me write this. 2 over 3 times 12 over 1 is equal to-- if you divide that by 3, you get a 4, divide that by 3, you get a 1-- is equal to 8. So you get 5 times q minus 7 is equal to 8."
Math,"And then instead of dividing both sides by 5, which would get us pretty close to what we were doing over here, let me distribute this 5, I just want to show you, you can do it multiple legitimate ways. So 5 times q is 5q. 5 times negative 7 is minus, or negative 35, is equal to 8. 5q minus 35 is equal to 8. Now, if I want to get rid of that minus 35, or that negative 35, the best way to do it is to add 35 to both sides."
Math,"I did that so that these cancel out, and I'm left with 5q is equal to 8 plus 35, which is 43. Now I can multiply both sides of this equation by 1/5, which is the same thing as dividing both sides by 5. And these cancel out. You get q is equal to 43 over 5. So there's a bunch of ways you can do these problems. But as long as you do legitimate steps, you will get the right answer. And I'll leave it to you to verify that this truly is the right answer for q. This is the q that will satisfy this equation."
Math,"Let's do one word problem here. Jade is stranded downtown with only $10 to get home. Taxis cost $0.75 per mile, but there's an additional $2.35 hire charge. Write a formula and use it to calculate how many miles she can travel with her money. All right. So the total cost of a cab ride is going to be equal to just the initial hire charge, which is $2.35, plus the $0.75 per mile, times the number of miles. We're letting m is equal to the miles she travels. Miles traveled. So this is the equation."
Math,"We know that she only has $10 to get home. So her cost has to be $10. So we have to say, the cost has to be $10. So 10 is equal to 2.35 plus 0.75m. So how do we solve for m, or the number of miles Jade can travel? Well, we can get rid of the 2.35 on this right-hand side by subtracting that amount from both sides of this equation. So let's do that. So let's subtract minus 2.35 from both sides. These will cancel out. That was the point. The left-hand side-- what is 10 minus 2.35? Now, these will cancel out."
Math,"Now what is 10 minus 2.35? 10 minus 2 is 8. 10 minus 2.3 is 7.7. So it's going to be 7.65. If you want to believe me, let's do it. 10 minus 2.35. And that is going to be equal to 0.75m. Let me write that in that same color. It's nice to see where different things came from. 0.75m. I have, like, five shades of this purple here. so this is that, that is that, and then these two guys canceled out. Now to solve for m, I can just divide both sides by 0.75."
Math,"So if I divide that side by 0.75, I have to do it to the left-hand side as well. That cancels out, so on the right-hand side, I'm left with just an m. And on the left-hand side-- I'll have to get my calculator out for this one-- I have 7.65 divided by 0.75, which is equal to 10.2. m is 10.2, so Jade can travel 10.2 miles.."
Math,"Or why am I not getting the answer that I think I should get? So let's get some practice here. So I have an equation, nine times, and then in parentheses, two x plus 1/3 is equal to 39. And then someone has worked it out. This is step one, step two, then step three. They get to this solution, x equals two."
Math,"What I want you to do is pause this video and figure out, is this solution correct? Did all of the steps they do, do they make logical sense, do they make algebraic sense? Or did they make a mistake in one of these steps, and if so, which of these steps did they make a mistake in? All right, so let's just work through this problem and see if all of these steps are reasonable. So in this first step, let's see, they got an 18x here, so it looks like they distributed the nine."
Math,"So nine times two x would be 18x, and then of course, you would also have to do nine times 1/3. Nine times 1/3 would be 9/3, or three, so that seems reasonable. And you still have a 39 here on the right-hand side. So step one checks out. Now, let's see, what did they do over here? After step one, or at this stage, you had 18x plus three, and then over here you only have 18x. So they must've subtracted three from the left-hand side to get rid of this three. So they subtracted three from the left-hand side."
Math,"Well, if they subtract three from the left-hand side, they also need to subtract three from the right-hand side, and it looks like they did. 39 minus three is 36. So that step checks out. And so you have 18x is equal to 36. And so to solve for x, you would just wanna divide both sides by 18. So you would get x is equal to 36 over 18, or 2. So all of these steps check out, and so there's no problem here, no mistake. And you can verify that x does indeed equal two."
Math,"Let's do some more questions, or see if we can identify more errors or maybe no errors. All right, we have 8/3 is equal to three times c plus 5/3, and we wanna solve for c. Pause the video and see if any of these mistakes are, or if any of these steps, are incorrect or maybe there's no mistake at all. All right, let's go step by step. So in step one, kept the left-hand side the same. The right-hand side, let's see, you go from three times this to three c, so it looks like they're distributing the three."
Math,"So three times c is indeed three c, and then you wanna distribute three times 5/3, well, that's gonna be five. That's not gonna be 5/3. This thing right over here, this thing needs to be five, not 5/3, so that is not correct. So step one is where we have the problem. Let's keep going. Let's do one more of these. I find this strangely entertaining. All right, this is a little bit simpler. 1/4 r plus two is equal to 10."
Math,"And then they immediately go from that to just 1/4 r, so they got rid of this two on the left-hand side. Well, to do that you could subtract two from the left, but, of course, you would also have to do that from the right-hand side. And so you get 1/4 r plus two minus two, that would be just 1/4 r. So the left-hand side makes sense. 10 minus two is not 12. 10 minus two is eight. This right over here should be eight. They added two on the right-hand side."
Math,"They subtracted two on the left-hand side, and they added two on the right-hand side. Then the equality wouldn't hold anymore. So you definitely have an error. Step one is not correct.."
Math,"Which plan should I take? So the first place, I might start is to think about how much I would pay depending on how many sessions I actually take And to do a little short hand here let's just define some variables Let's say that S = ""Number of Sessions"" I attend per month Number of sessions per month that I attend I decided to attend at Super Yoga And let's say that C = ""Total Monthly Cost"" My Total Monthly Cost So with these variables defined this way, let's think about how much I would pay under each of these plans depending on how many sessions I would attend So first, let's think about the, we'll start with the Trial Plan cause that seems a little simplier and I'll draw a little column here I have a cost, actually, let me see, I'll draw my number of sessions Number of sessions and then I have my cost and then I'm going to draw a little table here A little table, that'll be for my trial plan and then let's also do the same thing, since we're doing it for the trial plan let's do it for the basic plan so that we can compare Let's do it for the basic plan so I have the Number of sessions I attend and my Total Cost So let's first think about, if I decide to attend no sessions So if I decided to attend no sessions under my trial plan, what will be my cost? Well, $12 per session, 12 x no sessions Well, I'm not going to have to pay anything My cost is going to be zero Now what about that same question under the basic plan If I have the basic plan, but in a given month I attend no sessions, I don't go to the gym, I don't go to this yoga gym at all How much am I going to have to pay? Well, it's $8 per sessions I didn't have to go to any sessions So I'm not going to have to pay anything on a per session basis but I will have to pay that $20/month So I will have to pay $20 even though I didn't even attend That doesn't seem so good in that scenario But let's keep working through other scenarios Let's think about the scenario where I attend 1 session Where I attend 1 session Under the trial plan, how much will I have to pay? Well, it's $12/session x 1 session I'm going to pay $12 Let's think about that same scenario under the basic plan Under the basic plan, if I attend 1 session Well, it's $8/session x 1 session $8 for that Plus just the basic monthly So I'm just going to have to pay $20 + ($8 x 1) So $28."
Math,"I'm going to have to pay $28 So still that trial plan still looks pretty good even if I attend 1 session Let me make it clear That's in dollars and that over here is $28 and I could keep going and I encourage you to keep going but let's try 1 more just to see how, just to get a feel for the numbers here If I attend 2 sessions under the trial plan How much am I going to pay? Well, it's $12/session x 2 sessions i'm going to pay $24 Let's think about the basic plan if I attend 2 sessions -- let me do that in a yellow colour -- if I attend 2 sessions 2 x $8/session, that's going to $16 plus the $20 I'm going to have to spend every month So it's going to 2 x $8 = $16 + $20 So at least for the scenarios that we set up here if I attend 0 or 1 or 2 sessions the trial plan seems to be winning out but I want to explore at what point does the trial plan actually become a little bit worse But before we do that let's think about if we can represent this this a little algebraically because it's going to allow us to be a little bit more precise with coming up with our answers So if we say that, S is the ""Number of Sessions per Month"" and C is the ""Monthly Cost"" How can we express the trial plan as an equation? Well, we could say our Total Cost our Total Monthly Cost so this is for our trial plan right over here let me draw a dotted line over here to show well, the dotted line goes around there so under the trial plan our total cost is going to be equal to well, it's $12/session x # of sessions times S So under the trial plan I could say my total cost is equal to $12 x # of Sessions $12/session x the Number of Sessions Let's so the same thing with the basic plan How can we express that as an equation? Well, we have our total cost our total cost is going to be equal to well, regardless of what we do any given month, we're going to have to pay the $20/month we're going to have to pay that 20 So no matter what we do, we're going to have to pay that 20 just from the get-go and then we're going to pay $8/session so it's going to be $20 + ($8 x # of Sessions) so that's interesting and you can see if you put S is 0 here, if you make S = 0 you get 20 + (8 x 0) which is 20 if you say S is 1, you get 20 + (8 x 1) which is 28 so you see that each of these S's and C's they satisfy this equation Same thing over here and we can keep trying more and more What's neat about these equations is just this equation encapsulates all of the possible combinations here and just this equation encapsulates all the possible combinations there and so for the next few videos, what I want to do is explore How can we use these equations to come up with more insights as to which plan is better for me."
Math,"The equations really are just a mathematical representation of the same information that we had up here. So as a starting point, let's think about how much, under the basic plan, it'll cost for us to attend 3 sessions in a given month. Well, we've got our equation right over here. Our total cost in that month is going to be equal to 20 plus 8 times the number of sessions. The number of sessions is S. S is 3 in this circumstances, so we'll replace the S with the 3."
Math,"And so you get our cost in this circumstance is going to be 20 plus 8 times 3, or 20 plus 24, or $44. Let me erase this right over here. So this is going to cost us $44. Now let's do the same thing under the trial plan. How much is it going to cost us to attend 3 sessions? Well, this is more straightforward, or slightly more straightforward. Our total cost is going to be equal to 12 times the number of sessions. The number of sessions in this circumstance are 3 sessions, so it's going to be 12 times 3."
Math,"Our total cost is going to be equal to $36. Let me write that down. It's going to be equal to $36. But we could also answer more interesting questions with these equations. For example, how many sessions can I attend in a month for, oh, I don't know, let's throw out something, $54. Let's say that's just my budget. When I look at my salary and how much money I have budgeted to health and fitness, this is what I can afford."
Math,"And so based on that, I want to ask, how many sessions can I attend in each of these situations? First, let's think about it for the trial plan. How many sessions can I attend for $54? Now let's just assume that this is some type of a special yoga studio where you can even attend half a session. So if you attend half a session, they'll charge you $6. If you attend a fourth of a session, they'll charge you $3. So they'll actually keep track of exactly what fraction of a session you're attending."
Math,"You don't have to just attend whole number of sessions. You could attend 2 and 1/2, and they'll bill you accordingly. With that said, how many sessions under the trial plan can I attend for $54? Well, let's think about this a little bit. My cost now is going to be $54. $54 is C. It's my monthly cost. So 54 is going to be equal to $12 per session times the number of sessions. Now I set up this equation."
Math,"In order to answer this question, I just need to figure out what's the number of sessions that satisfy it. Now this S is an unknown variable. What number of sessions times 12 is equal to 54? Well, you might say, well, if I could get just a S on the right-hand side here, then I'll have an answer. S will be equal to some value. And if I want just a S on the right-hand side, I'd ideally just like to divide this by 12. 12S divided by 12 is just going to give me a S."
Math,"It's just going to give me the number of sessions. But if I have an equal sign, I can't just willy-nilly divide one side by 12 without doing the exact same thing to the other side. If that is equal to that, in order for them to both still be equal, I have to do the same thing to both sides. So on the right-hand side, I'm left with just a S. And on the left-hand side, I have 54 divided by 12. Let me think about that. I'll just work it out. 12 goes into 54 4 times. 4 times 12 is 48."
Math,"You're left with a remainder of 6. So you could say 12 goes into 54, or you could say 54/12 is equal to 4 and 6/12 or 4 and 1/2. So the number of sessions that I could attend are 4 and 1/2. If I have $54 to spend, I could attend 4 and 1/2 sessions under the trial plan. If this was a yoga studio that said, oh, you can't attend half sessions, then you could say, well, at most I could attend four sessions, because five sessions would get me above my budget."
Math,"But I said that you can attend fractional sessions, so we're going to say 4 and 1/2. Now let's answer the same question for the basic plan. Under the basic plan, how many sessions can I attend for $54? Well, once again, this is going to be our total cost for that month. So we say $54 is equal to 20 plus 8 times the number of sessions. And once again, I'd like to just have sessions maybe on the right-hand side of this equation. So I could say, oh, sessions are going to be equal to something."
Math,"This is the number of sessions that I could attend. But I have this 20 here and this 8 here, and so I have to think about how I can get rid of them. The first thing I've got to think about is, how can I get rid of this 20 from the right-hand side of this equation? What am I going to have to do to the entire equation? Well, the simplest thing is I could subtract 20 from the right-hand side."
Math,"But if I subtract 20 from the right-hand side, I also have to subtract 20 from the left-hand side in order to maintain the equality. So I'm left with, on the left-hand side, 54 minus 20 gets me 34. And that's going to be equal to-- well, the whole point of subtracting 20 is so that these negate each other. And then I have just an 8S. So 8 times the number of sessions has to be equal to 34 in order for 8 times the number of sessions plus 20 to be equal to 54."
Math,"And then you could add 20 to both sides of this equation to get our original. We're almost done. We just want to isolate the S right here. And you can imagine the easiest way would be to divide the right-hand side by 8. But if we're dividing the right-hand side by 8, we have to do the same to the left. And so what do we get for the number of sessions that we would have to attend? Well, these cancel out. And so you get the number of sessions is equal to 34 divied by 8."
Math,"34 divided by 8 is equal to, let's see, 8 goes into 34 four times with a remainder of 2, so 4 and 2/8, or it's 4 and 1/4. So I could attend 4 and 1/4 sessions under the basic plan. Assuming I can do fractional sessions, for $54, which one can I attend more sessions in, the basic plan or the trial plan? Well, for $54 I could attend a slightly longer amount of sessions under the trial plan.."
Math,"Well, let's think about what we have to figure out. We have to figure out the minimum number of computers she needs to sell. So let's set that to a variable or set a variable to represent that. So let's let x equal the number of computers she sells. Number of computers sold. Now, let's think about how much net profit she will make in a month. And that's what we're thinking about."
Math,"How many computers, the minimum number she needs to sell in order to make a net profit? So I'll write her profit is going to be how much money she brings in from selling the computers. And she makes $27 on every computer she sells. So her profit is going to be $27 times the number of computer she sells. She gets $27 per computer times the number she sells. But we're not done yet. She still has expenses of $10,000 per month. So we're going to have to subtract out the $10,000."
Math,"What we care about is making a profit. We want this number right over here to be greater than 0. So let's just think about what number of computers would get us to 0. And then, maybe she needs to sell a little bit more than that. So let's see what gets her to break even. So break even-- that's 0 profit. Neither positive or negative-- is equal to 27 times-- and I'll do it all in one color now. 27x minus 10,000. Well, we've seen equations like this before. We can add 10,000 to both sides."
Math,"Add 10,000 to both sides, so it's no longer on the right-hand side. And we are left with 10,000. 10,000 is equal to 27x. And then to solve for x, we just have to divide both sides by 27. Let's do that. Divide both sides by 27. On our right-hand side, we have x. So let me just write this down. So we have x on our right-hand side is going to be equal to 10,000/27. I switched the right and the left-hand sides here. Now, what is this going to be? Well, we can do a little bit of long division to handle that."
Math,"So 27 goes into 10,000. So 27 doesn't go into 1. Doesn't go into 10. It goes into 100 three times. 3 times 27 is what? 100 minus 81 is 19. Then we can bring down a 0. 27 goes into 190? It looks like it will go into it about six times. Let's see if that's right. 6 times 7 is 42. 6 times 2 is 12. Plus 4. Let's see, 90 minus 62 is actually 28. Let me turn this back. So it goes 7 times. 7 times 7 is 49. 7 times 2 is 14. Plus 4 is 18. There you go. Look at that. So 190 minus 189. We get 1."
Math,"Let's bring down another 0. We bring down another 0. We have a 0 right there. 27 goes into 10 how many times? Well, it doesn't go into 10 at all. So we'll put a 0 right there. 0 times 27 is 0. Then we subtract. And then, we get 10 again. And now we're in the decimal range. Or we're going to start getting decimal values. We can bring down another 0. We could get 27 goes into 100 three times. So our x-value is going to be approximately 370.3. And then we're going to keep going on and on and on and on."
Math,"But this is enough information for us to answer our question. What is the minimum number of computers she needs to sell in a month to make a profit? Well, she can't sell a decimal number of computers, a third of a computer. She could either sell 370 computers. If she sells 370 computers, then she's not going to get to break even because that's less than the quantity she needs for break even. So she needs to sell 371. She needs to sell 371 computers in a month to make a profit.."
Math,"They tell us that it's a rectangular garden. So it looks something like this. And let's say that this is the width. So if this is the width, then this is also going to be the width. And this is the length up here. And they tell us that the length of the garden is twice the width. So if this is w, then the length is going to be 2w. It's going to be twice the width. This is also going to be 2w over here. Now, what's the perimeter of this garden? Well, it's going to be w plus w plus 2w plus 2w."
Math,"Let me write this down. The perimeter of this garden is going to be equal to w plus 2w plus w plus 2w, which is equal to what? This is w plus 2w is 3w, 4w, 6w. So this is equal to 6w. That's the perimeter in terms of the width. But they also tell us that the actual numerical value of the perimeter is 60 feet. It is 60 feet. So this perimeter 6w must be equal to 60 if we assume that we're dealing with feet. So we just have the equation 6w is equal to 60."
Math,"We can divide both sides of this equation by 6 so that we have just a w on the left-hand side. 6w divided by 6 is just w. And then 60 divided by 6 is 10. So we have w is equal to 10. So the width of the garden is 10. So this distance over here is 10. And then what is the length of the garden? Well, it's 2 times the width. So this is equal to 20. The length is equal to 20. And so we're done. This is a 20 by 10 garden.."
Math,"How many trees did MacDonald's farm have initially? Let's let t equal what they're asking is for. So this is the number of trees initially. So he starts off with t trees, but then they tell us that he has to cut down 5 trees to control the insects. So how many trees would he have after that? Well, he started with t, and he had to cut down 5, so he's going to have t minus 5 trees now. Now, they tell us that each of the remaining trees-- and we know there are t minus 5 remaining trees-- produced 210 oranges."
Math,"So each of these t minus 5 trees are going to produce 210 oranges. So this is the number of oranges that t minus 5 trees are going to produce. This is the number of trees times the oranges per tree. So this is the total number of oranges produced after cutting the 5 trees. And then they tell us that this ends up being a total harvest of 41,790. So this is equal to 41,790. So we've set up our equation. Now we just have to solve for t, the number of trees that MacDonald initially had."
Math,"So the first thing I would do here is, well, I'm multiplying this expression by 210. Well, why don't I just divide both sides of this by 210? There's many ways that you could do this. You could distribute the 210 and go in another direction. Actually, I will do it both ways just to show that you could do it both ways. So the first way, I'm going to divide both sides by 210. The left-hand side simplifies to t minus 5. The right-hand side-- let's see, what is 4,000-- I'm going to do some long division here."
Math,"I'll do it on the side, so 41,790 divided by 210. Let's see, 210 does not go into 4. It does not going into 41. It goes into 417 one time, because two times would be 420-- one time. 1 times 210 is 210. You subtract. You get 207, and then you bring down the 9. How many times does 210 go into 2,079? It looks like it would go into it not quite 10 times. It looks like it would go into it nine times. 9 times 210 is going to be-- let's see. 9 times 0 is 0. 9 times 1 is 9. 9 times 2 is 18."
Math,"And then we subtract again. 9 minus 0 is 9. We have to regroup from the thousands place, so let's take 1,000 from there. Let's give that 1,000 to the hundreds place, so it becomes 10 hundreds. But then we have to take 100 from the hundreds place, so this becomes 9, and give to the tens place. So this becomes 17 tens, or 170. So 17 minus 9 is 8. 9 minus 8 is 1. So we get 189. And now we can bring down another 0. It's a little off-center right now."
Math,"And we already see that 210 goes into 1,800 ninety-nine times. 9 times 210 is 1,890. When we subtract, we have no remainder. So what we get on the right-hand side is 199. And now we just have to add 5 to both sides. Remember, whatever we have to do to one side, we have to do the other. Otherwise, the equality wouldn't be equal anymore. They were equal before adding 5, so if you want them to still be equal, you have to do the same thing to both sides. So the left-hand side becomes t."
Math,"I'll do the t in that purple color. And the right-hand side becomes 204. So he started off with 204 trees. Now, I told you there's multiple ways to do this. Instead of dividing both sides by 210, you could have decided to distribute the 210. And then you would have ended up with-- let me do another alternate way of doing it. 210 times t minus 5 times 210. Actually, let me just multiply it out so we save some space. 5 times 210 is 1,050-- minus 1,050 is equal to 41,790."
Math,"And then you could add 1,050 to both sides. And so let me do that, 1,050 to both sides. 1,050, not 150. The left-hand side, you're just going to be left with 210t. While the right-hand side, let's see, you're going to be 0 plus 0 is 0. 9 plus 5 is 14. 1 plus 7 is 8-- 42,840. And now you can divide both sides by 210. Now we know where this is going to go. I could do the long division again. t is going to be equal to 42,840 divided 210, which is equal to 204.."
Math,"All right, now let's think through this together. So first of all, before I even graph it, I could say, let's say that M is how many minutes he is playing with his pet, before getting ready. So let's just call it, that's what M is going to be equal to. It's how many minutes he spends. And so how would M relate to the 48 minutes? Well, he has 48 minutes, so he could spend anywhere from zero, up to and including 48 minutes. So you might say M is less than 48."
Math,"But it's not just less than, it could even be exactly 48 minutes. As long as immediately after that, he gets ready for his dance lesson. So M is less than or equal to 48. So if I were to put that on a number line, let me construct a number line like this. And let me put this at zero right over here. And let's say this is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, keep going. This could be 70. This is going to be essentially the values of M that are going to be okay, as long as he's prepared for his dance lesson."
Math,"M is less than or equal to 48. So what we can do is, we can go to 48, which is, let's see, this would be 45, so 40 eight's gonna be right around there. So that's 48. And since it can be equal to 48, we're gonna fill in the circle. If it just said purely less than 48, but not less than or equal, then we would put an open circle here. But because it's less than or equal to, we're going to include 48 right over there. I'll write the number 48 to make it clear what that is, and less than or equal to."
Math,"So it's gonna be all of the values less than that. And so it would look something like this. I'm doing that light blue color. It would look something like then, like that. And if we wanted to be clear that we're including zero, we could actually put a dot here as well. It wouldn't make sense to go and include negative values as well. But let's do another example, a different example."
Math,"So here, we are told that the Harris family needs to heat their leftover gumbo, to a minimum of 74 degrees Celsius, to be sure it is safe to eat. Graph temperatures to which they could heat their food, so that it is safe to eat. So once again, pause this video, and see if you could think about that, before we do this together. All right, well let's imagine, let's see, maybe we'll say T for temperature. So T for temperature."
Math,"And let's say T is the temperature that they heat to, temperature that they heat their gumbo to, that they heat to. And now let's do a number line. We see, well, before I even do number line, let me express it as some kind of an inequality. So they need a minimum of 74 degrees Celsius. So that means it has to be at least 74, or higher. So that means T is not just greater than 74 degrees Celsius. It can also be exactly 74 degrees Celsius, 'cause it says as long as it's a minimum of 74."
Math,"So if it's exactly 74, that is apparently going to be safe to eat. And anything higher than that, is also going to be safe to eat. At some point you can get to such a high temperature, that you essentially turn your food into ash. It might not be a delicious gumbo anymore, but it would probably be safe to eat, if you're just eating gumbo powder of some gumbo ash I guess. Actually, I'm not sure if that's safe to eat. But let's just assume it is. I don't recommend doing that."
Math,"But let's put this on the number line. So let me, and actually here, actually, let me do it in white so that I can, in that reddish color, I can actually put the values that we care about. And we can have negative temperature, if we're talking about degrees Celsius. So let's say that this is zero degrees, this is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70. Let me label that one. That's 70 degrees. This would be 80 degrees right over here. If we wanted to, this would be negative 10, negative 20."
Math,"And we have to be greater than, or equal to 74 degrees Celsius. If we just had T is greater than 74 degrees Celsius, we would go to 74, which would be right around there. We put an open circle, and then we would go greater than that. So that's if T was strictly greater than 74 degrees Celsius. But it's greater than or equal to. And so because of that, we are going to fill in this dot right over there. And to be clear, that is at 74 degrees and we're done.."
Math,"I encourage you to pause this video and try these numbers out, does zero satisfy this inequality? Does it satisfy this one? Does one satisfy this one? Does it satisfy that one? I encourage you to try these four numbers out on these two inequalities. Assuming you have tried that, let's work through this together. Let's say, if we try out zero on this inequality right over here, let's substitute x with zero. So, we'll have zero plus two needs to be less than or equal to two times zero."
Math,"Is that true? Well, on the left hand side, this is two needs to be less than or equal to zero. Is that true, is two less than or equal to zero? No, two is larger than zero. So this is not going to be true, this does not satisfy the left hand side inequality, let's see if it satisfies this inequality over here. In order to satisfy it, three times zero plus four needs to be greater than five times zero. Well three times zero is just zero, five times zero is zero."
Math,"So four needs to be greater than zero, which is true. So it does satisfy this inequality right over here so zero does satisfy this inequality. Let's try out one. To satisfy this one, one plus two needs to be less than or equal to two. One plus two is three, is three less than or equal than two? No, three is larger than two. This does not satisfy the left hand inequality. What about the right hand inequality right over here? Three times one plus four needs to be greater than five times one."
Math,"So three times one is three, plus four. So seven needs to be greater than five, well that's true. Both zero and one satisfy three x plus four is greater than five x, neither of them satisfy x plus two is less than or equal to two x. Now let's go to the two. I know it's getting a little bit unaligned, but I'll just do it all in the same color so you can tell. Let's try out two here, two plus two needs to be less than or equal to two times two. Four needs to be less than or equal to four."
Math,"Well four is equal to four and it just has to be less than or equal, so this satisfies. This satisfies this inequality. What about this purple inequality? Let's see, three times two plus four needs to be greater than five times two. Three times two is six plus four is ten, needs to be greater than 10. 10 is equal to 10, it's not greater than 10. It does not satisfy this inequality. If this was a greater than or equal to it would have satisfied but it's not. 10 is not greater than 10."
Math,"It would satisfy greater than or equal to because 10 is equal to 10. So two satisfies the left hand one but not the right hand one. Let's try out five. Five plus two needs to be less than or equal to two times five, once again everywhere we see an x, we replace it with a five. Seven needs to be less than or equal to 10. Which is absolutely true, seven is less than 10. So it satisfies less than or equal to."
Math,"Five satisfies this inequality and what you're probably noticing now is that an inequality can have many numbers that satisfy. In fact they sometimes will have nothing that satisfies it and sometimes they might have an infinite number of numbers that satisfy it and you see that right over here. We're just testing out a few numbers. For this left one, zero and one didn't work, two and five did work. This right one, zero and one worked, two didn't work. Let's see what five does."
Math,"In order for five to satisfy it, three times x. Now we're gonna try x being five. Three times five plus four needs to be greater than five times five. Three times five is fifteen, fifteen plus four is nineteen. Nineteen is to be greater than 25, it is not. So five does not satisfy this inequality right over here. Anyway, hopefully you found that fun.."
Math,"So let's say I had negative 0.5x is less than or equal to 7.5. Now, if this was an equality, your natural impulse is to say, hey, let's divide both sides by the coefficient on the x term, and that is a completely legitimate thing to do: divide both sides by negative 0.5. The important thing you need to realize, though, when you do it with an inequality is that when you multiply or divide both sides of the equation by a negative number, you swap the inequality. Think of it this way."
Math,"I'll do a simple example here. If I were to tell you that 1 is less than 2, I think you would agree with that. 1 is definitely less than 2. Now, what happens if I multiply both sides of this by negative 1? Negative 1 versus negative 2? Well, all of a sudden, negative 2 is more negative than negative 1. So here, negative 2 is actually less than negative 1. Now, this isn't a proof, but I think it'll give you comfort on why you're swapping the sign."
Math,"If something is larger, when you take the negative of both of it, it'll be more negative, or vice versa. So that's why, if we're going to multiply both sides of this equation or divide both sides of the equation by a negative number, we need to swap the sign. So let's multiply both sides of this equation. Dividing by 0.5 is the same thing as multiplying by 2. Our whole goal here is to have a 1 coefficient there. So let's multiply both sides of this equation by negative 2."
Math,"So we have negative 2 times negative 0.5. And you might say, hey, how did Sal get this 2 here? My brain is just thinking what can I multiply negative 0.5 by to get 1? And negative 0.5 is the same thing as negative 1/2. The inverse of that is negative 2. So I'm multiplying negative 2 times both sides of this equation. And I have the 7.5 on the other side. I'm going to multiply that by negative 2 as well."
Math,"And remember, when you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative, you swap the inequality. You had less than or equal? Now it'll be greater than or equal. So the left-hand side, negative 2 times negative 0.5 is just 1. You get x is greater than or equal to 7.5 times negative 2. That's negative 15, which is our solution set. All x's larger than negative 15 will satisfy this equation. I challenge you to try it. For example, 0 will work. 0 is greater than negative 15."
Math,"But try something like-- try negative 16. Negative 16 will not work. Negative 16 times negative 0.5 is 8, which is not less than 7.5. So the solution set is all of the x's-- let me draw a number line here-- greater than negative 15. So that is negative 15 there, maybe that's negative 16, that's negative 14. Greater than or equal to negative 15 is the solution. Now, you might also see solution sets to inequalities written in interval notation. And interval notation, it just takes a little getting used to."
Math,"We want to include negative 15, so our lower bound to our interval is negative 15. And putting in this bracket here means that we're going to include negative 15. The set includes the bottom boundary. It includes negative 15. And we're going to go all the way to infinity. And we put a parentheses here. Parentheses normally means that you're not including the upper bound. You also do it for infinity, because infinity really isn't a normal number, so to speak. You can't just say, oh, I'm at infinity."
Math,"You're never at infinity. So that's why you put that parentheses. But the parentheses tends to mean that you don't include that boundary, but you also use it with infinity. So this and this are the exact same thing. Sometimes you might also see set notations, where the solution of that, they might say x is a real number such that-- that little line, that vertical line thing, just means such that-- x is greater than or equal to negative 15."
Math,"These curly brackets mean the set of all real numbers, or the set of all numbers, where x is a real number, such that x is greater than or equal to negative 15. All of this, this, and this are all equivalent. Let's keep that in mind and do a couple of more examples. So let's say we had 75x is greater than or equal to 125. So here we can just divide both sides by 75. And since 75 is a positive number, you don't have to change the inequality. So you get x is greater than or equal to 125/75."
Math,"And if you divide the numerator and denominator by 25, this is 5/3. So x is greater than or equal to 5/3. Or we could write the solution set being from including 5/3 to infinity. And once again, if you were to graph it on a number line, 5/3 is what? That's 1 and 2/3. So you have 0, 1, 2, and 1 and 2/3 will be right around there. We're going to include it. That right there is 5/3. And everything greater than or equal to that will be included in our solution set. Let's do another one."
Math,"Let's say we have x over negative 3 is greater than negative 10/9. So we want to just isolate the x on the left-hand side. So let's multiply both sides by negative 3, right? The coefficient, you could imagine, is negative 1/3, so we want to multiply by the inverse, which should be negative 3. So if you multiply both sides by negative 3, you get negative 3 times-- this you could rewrite it as negative 1/3x, and on this side, you have negative 10/9 times negative 3."
Math,"And the inequality will switch, because we are multiplying or dividing by a negative number. So the inequality will switch. It'll go from greater than to less than. So the left-hand side of the equation just becomes an x. That was the whole point. That cancels out with that. The negatives cancel out. x is less than. And then you have a negative times a negative. That will make it a positive. Then if you divide the numerator and the denominator by 3, you get a 1 and a 3, so x is less than 10/3."
Math,"So if we were to write this in interval notation, the solution set will-- the upper bound will be 10/3 and it won't include 10/3. This isn't less than or equal to, so we're going to put a parentheses here. Notice, here it included 5/3. We put a bracket. Here, we're not including 10/3. We put a parentheses. It'll go from 10/3, all the way down to negative infinity. Everything less than 10/3 is in our solution set. And let's draw that. Let's draw the solution set. So 10/3, so we might have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4."
Math,"10/3 is 3 and 1/3, so it might sit-- let me do it in a different color. It might be over here. We're not going to include that. It's less than 10/3. 10/3 is not in the solution set. That is 10/3 right there, and everything less than that, but not including 10/3, is in our solution set. Let's do one more. Say we have x over negative 15 is less than 8. So once again, let's multiply both sides of this equation by negative 15. So negative 15 times x over negative 15. Then you have an 8 times a negative 15."
Math,"And when you multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number or divide both sides by a negative number, you swap the inequality. It's less than, you change it to greater than. And now, this left-hand side just becomes an x, because these guys cancel out. x is greater than 8 times 15 is 80 plus 40 is 120, so negative 120. Is that right? 80 plus 40. Yep, negative 120. Or we could write the solution set as starting at negative 120-- but we're not including negative 120."
Math,"We don't have an equal sign here-- going all the way up to infinity. And if we were to graph it, let me draw the number line here. I'll do a real quick one. Let's say that that is negative 120. Maybe zero is sitting up here. This would be negative 121. This would be negative 119. We are not going to include negative 120, because we don't have an equal sign there, but it's going to be everything greater than negative 120. All of these things that I'm shading in green would satisfy the inequality."
Math,"And you can even try it out. Does zero work? Yeah, that's zero. That's definitely less than 8. I mean, that doesn't prove it to you, but you could try any of these numbers and they should work. Anyway, hopefully, you found that helpful. I'll see you in the next video.."
Math,"I just rewrote it a little bit bigger. So if we want to solve for c, we just want to isolate the c right over here, maybe on the left-hand side. It's right now being multiplied by negative 5. So the best way to just have a c on the left-hand side is we can multiply both sides of this inequality by the inverse of negative 5, or by negative 1/5. So we want to multiply negative 1/5 times negative 5c. And we also want to multiply 15 times negative 1/5."
Math,"I'm just multiplying both sides of the inequality by the inverse of negative 5, because this will cancel out with the negative 5 and leave me just with c. Now I didn't draw the inequality here, because we have to remember, if we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to flip the inequality. And we are doing that. We are multiplying both sides by negative 1/5, which is the equivalent of dividing both sides by negative 5."
Math,"So we need to turn this from a less than or equal to a greater than or equal. And now we can proceed solving for c. So negative 1/5 times negative 5 is 1. So the left-hand side is just going to be c is greater than or equal to 15 times negative 1/5. That's the same thing as 15 divided by negative 5. And so that is negative 3. So our solution is c is greater than or equal to negative 3. And let's graph it. So that is my number line. Let's say that is 0, negative 1, negative 2, negative 3."
Math,"And then I could go above, 1, 2. And so c is greater than or equal to negative 3. So it can be equal to negative 3. So I'll fill that in right over there. Let me do it in a different color. So I'll fill it in right over there. And then it's greater than as well. So it's all of these values I am filling in in green. And you can verify that it works in the original inequality. Pick something that should work. Well, 0 should work. 0 is one of the numbers that we filled in."
Math,"Negative 5 times 0 is 0, which is less than or equal to 15. It's less than 15. Now let's try a number that's outside of it. And I haven't drawn it here. I could continue with the number line in this direction. We would have a negative 4 here. Negative 4 should not be included. And let's verify that negative 4 doesn't work. Negative 4 times negative 5 is positive 20. And positive 20 is not less than 15, so it's good that we did not include negative 4. So this is our solution."
Math,And this is that solution graphed. And I wanted to do that in that other green color. Here you go. That's what it looks like..
Math,"The size of each tile is one square foot. Write an inequality that represents the number of tiles he can purchase with a $1,000 limit. And then figure out how large the stone patio can be. So let x be equal to the number of tiles purchased. And so the cost of purchasing x tiles, they're going to be $3 each, so it's going to be 3x. So 3x is going to be the total cost of purchasing the tiles. And he wants to spend less than $1,000. 3x is how much he spends if he buys x tiles."
Math,"It has to be less than $1,000, we say it right there. If it was less than or equal to, we'd have a little equal sign right there. So if we want to solve for x, how many tiles can he buy? We can divide both sides of this inequality by 3. And because we're dividing or multiplying-- you could imagine we're multiplying by 1/3 or dividing by 3 -- because this is a positive number, we do not have to swap the inequality sign. So we are left with x is less than 1,000 over three, which is 333 and 1/3."
Math,"So he has to buy less than 333 and 1/3 tiles, that's how many tiles, and each tile is one square foot. So if he can buy less than 333 and 1/3 tiles, then the patio also has to be less than 333 and 1/3 square feet. Feet squared, we could say square feet. And we're done.."
Math,"Let's convert this to an improper fraction. So 8 and 1/3 is equal to-- the denominator's going to be 3. 3 times 8 is 24, plus 1 is 25. So this thing over here is the same thing as 25 over 3. Let me just rewrite the whole thing. So it's 2/3 is greater than negative 4y minus 25 over 3. Now, the next thing I want to do, just because dealing with fractions are a bit of a pain, is multiply both sides of this inequality by some quantity that'll eliminate the fractions."
Math,"And the easiest one I can think of is multiply both sides by 3. That'll get rid of the 3's in the denominator. So let's multiply both sides of this equation by 3. That's the left-hand side. And then I'm going to multiply the right-hand side. 3, I'll put it in parentheses like that. Well, one point that I want to point out is that I did not have to swap the inequality sign, because I multiplied both sides by a positive number."
Math,"If the 3 was a negative number, if I multiplied both sides by negative 3, or negative 1, or negative whatever, I would have had to swap the inequality sign. Anyway, let's simplify this. So the left-hand side, we have 3 times 2/3, which is just 2. 2 is greater than. And then we can distribute this 3. 3 times negative 4y is negative 12y. And then 3 times negative 25 over 3 is just negative 25."
Math,"Now, we want to get all of our constant terms on one side of the inequality and all of our variable terms-- the only variable here is y on the other side-- the y is already sitting here, so let's just get this 25 on the other side of the inequality. And we can do that by adding 25 to both sides of this equation. So let's add 25 to both sides of this equation. And with the left-hand side, 2 plus 25 five is 27 and we're going to get 27 is greater than. The right-hand side of the inequality is negative 12y."
Math,"And then negative 25 plus 25, those cancel out, that was the whole point, so we're left with 27 is greater than negative 12y. Now, to isolate the y, you can either multiply both sides by negative 1/12 or you could say let's just divide both sides by negative 12. Now, because I'm multiplying or dividing by a negative number here, I'm going to need to swap the inequality. So let me write this."
Math,"If I divide both sides of this equation by negative 12, then it becomes 27 over negative 12 is less than-- I'm swapping the inequality, let me do this in a different color-- is less than negative 12y over negative 12. Notice, when I divide both sides of the inequality by a negative number, I swap the inequality, the greater than becomes a less than. When it was positive, I didn't have to swap it. So 27 divided by negative 12, well, they're both divisible by 3."
Math,"So we're going to get, if we divide the numerator and the denominator by 3, we get negative 9 over 4 is less than-- these cancel out-- y. So y is greater than negative 9/4, or negative 9/4 is less than y. And if you wanted to write that-- just let me write this-- our answer is y is greater than negative 9/4. I just swapped the order, you could say negative 9/4 is less than y."
Math,"Or if you want to visualize that a little bit better, 9/4 is 2 and 1/4, so we could also say y is greater than negative 2 and 1/4 if we want to put it as a mixed number. And if we wanted to graph it on the number line-- let me draw a number line right here, a real simple one. Maybe this is 0. Negative 2 is right over, let's say negative 1, negative 2, then say negative 3 is right there."
Math,"Negative 2 and 1/4 is going to be right here, and it's greater than, so we're not going to include that in the solution set. So we're going to make an open circle right there. And everything larger than that is a valid y, is a y that will satisfy the inequality.."
Math,"What can you say about the number of apples available at each farm? Does one farm have more than the other, or do they have the same amount? How do I know? So let's define some variables here. Let's let M be equal to number of apples at Maple Farms. And then who's the other guy? River Orchards. So let's let R be equal to the number of apples at River Orchards."
Math,"So this first sentence, they say-- let me do this in a different color-- they say for the past few years, Old Maple Farms has grown about 1,000 more apples than their chief rival in the region, River Orchards. So we could say, hey, Maple is approximately Old River, or M is approximately River plus 1,000."
Math,"Or since we don't know the exact amount-- it says it's about 1,000 more, so we don't know it's exactly 1,000 more-- we can just say that in a normal year, Old Maple Farms, which we denote by M, has a larger amount of apples than River Orchard. So in a normal year, M is greater than R, right? It has about 1,000 more apples than Old Maple Farms. Now, they say due to cold weather this year-- so let's talk about this year now-- the harvests at both farms were down about a third. So this isn't a normal year."
Math,"Let's talk about what's going to happen this year. In this year, each of these characters are going to be down by 1/3. Now if I go down by 1/3, that's the same thing as being 2/3 of what I was before. Let me do an example. If I'm at x, and I take away 1/3x, I'm left with 2/3x. So going down by 1/3 is the same thing as multiplying the quantity by 2/3."
Math,"So if we multiply each of these quantities by 2/3, we can still hold this inequality, because we're doing the same thing to both sides of this inequality, and we're multiplying by a positive number. If we were multiplying by a negative number, we would have to swap the inequality. So we can multiply both sides of this by 2/3. So 2/3 of M is still going to be greater than 2/3 of R. And you could even draw that in a number line if you like. Let's do this in a number line."
Math,"This all might be a little intuitive for you, and if it is, I apologize, but if it's not, it never hurts. So that's 0 on our number line. So in a normal year, M is has 1,000 more than R. So in a normal year, M might be over here and maybe R is over here. I don't know, let's say R is over there. Now, if we take 2/3 of M, that's going to stick us some place around, oh, I don't know, 2/3 is right about there. So this is M-- let me write this-- this is 2/3 M."
Math,"And what's 2/3 of R going to be? Well, if you take 2/3 of this, you get to right about there, that is 2/3R. So you can see, 2/3R is still less than 2/3M, or 2/3M is greater than 2/3R. Now, they say both farms made up for some of the shortfall by purchasing equal quantities of apples from farms in neighboring states. So let's let a be equal to the quantity of apples both purchased. So they're telling us that they both purchased the same amount."
Math,"So we could add a to both sides of this equation and it will not change the inequality. As long as you add or subtract the same value to both sides, it will not change the inequality. So if you add a to both sides, you have a plus 2/3M is a greater than 2/3R plus a. This is the amount that Old Maple Farms has after purchasing the apples, and this is the amount that River Orchards has. So after everything is said and done, Old Maple Farms still has more apples, and you can see that here."
Math,"Maple Farms, a normal year, this year they only had 2/3 of the production, but then they purchased a apples. So let's say a is about, let's say that a is that many apples, so they got back to their normal amount. So let's say they got back to their normal amount. So that's how many apples they purchased, so he got back to M. Now, if R, if River Orchards also purchased a apples, that same distance, a, if you go along here gets you to right about over there."
Math,"So once again, this is-- let me do it a little bit different, because I don't like it overlapping, so let me do it like this. So let's say this guy, M-- I keep forgetting their names-- Old Maple Farms purchases a apples, gets them that far. So that's a apples. But River Orchards also purchases a apples, so let's add that same amount. I'm just going to copy and paste it so it's the exact same amount. So River Orchards also purchases a, so it also purchases that same amount."
Math,"So when all is said and done, River Orchards is going to have this many apples in the year that they had less production but they went and purchased it. So this, right here, is-- this value right here is 2/3R plus a. That's what River Orchards has. And then Old Maple Farms has this value right here, which is 2/3M plus a. Everything said and done, Old Maple Farms still has more apples.."
Math,"So the number of people who attended their show in Las Vegas plus the number that attended their show in Mesa, which is 45,000, plus the number of people that attended their show in Denver, which is 33,000-- those are three cities right there, Las Vegas, Mesa, and Denver-- that has to be at least 120,000 people. Or another way of interpreting that is greater than or equal to 120,000. So to figure out how many people attended their show in Las Vegas, we just solve for l on this inequalty."
Math,"So if we simplify this left-hand side, we get the number of people in Las Vegas plus-- what's 45,000 plus 33,000, that is 78,000-- 78,000 is going to be greater than or equal to 120,000. Now to isolate the l on the left-hand side of the inequality, we can subtract 78,000 from both sides. So minus 78,000, minus 78,000 on the left-hand side, these cancel out. And we're just left with the number of people who attended the show in Las Vegas is going to be greater than or equal to 120,000 minus 78,000."
Math,"So 120,000 minus 80,000 is 40,000, and it's going to be another 2,000. So the number of people who attended Las Vegas is going to be greater than or equal to 42,000 people. And we're done, that's it."
Math,"Let's say that I have a fair coin over here. And so when I talk about a fair coin, I mean that it has an equal chance of landing on one side or another. So you can maybe view it as the sides are equal, their weight is the same on either side. If I flip it in the air, it's not more likely to land on one side or the other. It's equally likely. And so you have one side of this coin. So this would be the heads I guess. Try to draw George Washington. I'll assume it's a quarter of some kind."
Math,"And the other side, of course, is the tails. So that is heads. The other side right over there is tails. And so if I were to ask you, what is the probability-- I'm going to flip a coin. And I want to know what is the probability of getting heads. And I could write that like this-- the probability of getting heads. And you probably, just based on that question, have a sense of what probability is asking. It's asking for some type of way of getting your hands around an event that's fundamentally random."
Math,"We don't know whether it's heads or tails, but we can start to describe the chances of it being heads or tails. And we'll talk about different ways of describing that. So one way to think about it, and this is the way that probability tends to be introduced in textbooks, is you say, well, look, how many different, equally likely possibilities are there? So how many equally likely possibilities. So number of equally-- let me write equally-- of equally likely possibilities."
Math,"And of the number of equally possibilities, I care about the number that contain my event right here. So the number of possibilities that meet my constraint, that meet my conditions. So in the case of the probability of figuring out heads, what is the number of equally likely possibilities? Well, there's only two possibilities. We're assuming that the coin can't land on its corner and just stand straight up. We're assuming that it lands flat."
Math,"So there's two possibilities here, two equally likely possibilities. You could either get heads, or you could get tails. And what's the number of possibilities that meet my conditions? Well, there's only one, the condition of heads. So it'll be 1/2. So one way to think about it is the probability of getting heads is equal to 1/2. If I wanted to write that as a percentage, we know that 1/2 is the same thing as 50%."
Math,"Now, another way to think about or conceptualize probability that will give you this exact same answer is to say, well, if I were to run the experiment of flipping a coin-- so this flip, you view this as an experiment. I know this isn't the kind of experiment that you're used to. You know, you normally think an experiment is doing something in chemistry or physics or all the rest. But an experiment is every time you do, you run this random event."
Math,"So one way to think about probability is if I were to do this experiment, an experiment many, many, many times-- if I were to do it 1,000 times or a million times or a billion times or a trillion times-- and the more the better-- what percentage of those would give me what I care about? What percentage of those would give me heads? And so another way to think about this 50% probability of getting heads is if I were to run this experiment tons of times, if I were to run this forever, an infinite number of times, what percentage of those would be heads? You would get this 50%."
Math,"And you can run that simulation. You can flip a coin. And it's actually a fun thing to do. I encourage you to do it. If you take 100 or 200 quarters or pennies, stick them in a big box, shake the box so you're kind of simultaneously flipping all of the coins, and then count how many of those are going to be heads. And you're going to see that the larger the number that you are doing, the more likely you're going to get something really close to 50%."
Math,"And there's always some chance-- even if you flipped a coin a million times, there's some super-duper small chance that you would get all tails. But the more you do, the more likely that things are going to trend towards 50% of them are going to be heads. Now, let's just apply these same ideas. And while we're starting with probability, at least kind of the basic, this is probably an easier thing to conceptualize."
Math,"But a lot of times, this is actually a helpful one, too, this idea that if you run the experiment many, many, many, many times, what percentage of those trials are going to give you what you're asking for. In this case, it was heads. Now, let's do another very typical example when you first learn probability. And this is the idea of rolling a die. So here's my die right over here. And of course, you have, you know, the different sides of the die. So that's the 1. That's the 2. And that's the 3."
Math,"And what I want to do-- and we know, of course, that there are-- and I'm assuming this is a fair die. And so there are six equally likely possibilities. When you roll this, you could get a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6. And they're all equally likely."
Math,"So if I were to ask you, what is the probability given that I'm rolling a fair die-- so the experiment is rolling this fair die, what is the probability of getting a 1? Well, what are the number of equally likely possibilities? Well, I have six equally likely possibilities. And how many of those meet my conditions? Well, only one of them meets my condition, that right there. So there is a 1/6 probability of rolling a 1."
Math,"What is the probability of rolling a 1 or a 6? Well, once again, there are six equally likely possibilities for what I can get. There are now two possibilities that meet my conditions. I could roll a 1 or I could roll a 6. So now there are two possibilities that meet my constraints, my conditions. There is a 1/3 probability of rolling a 1 or a 6. Now, what is the probability-- and this might seem a little silly to even ask this question, but I'll ask it just to make it clear."
Math,"What is the probability of rolling a 2 and a 3? And I'm just talking about one roll of the die. Well, in any roll of the die, I can only get a 2 or a 3. I'm not talking about taking two rolls of this die. So in this situation, there's six possibilities, but none of these possibilities are 2 and a 3. None of these are 2 and a 3. 2 and a 3 cannot exist. On one trial, you cannot get a 2 and a 3 in the same experiment. Getting a 2 and a 3 are mutually exclusive events. They cannot happen at the same time."
Math,"So the probability of this is actually 0. There's no way to roll this normal die and all of a sudden, you get a 2 and a 3, in fact. And I don't want to confuse you with that, because it's kind of abstract and impossible. So let's cross this out right over here. Now, what is the probability of getting an even number? So once again, you have six equally likely possibilities when I roll that die."
Math,"And which of these possibilities meet my conditions, the condition of being even? Well, 2 is even, 4 is even, and 6 is even. So 3 of the possibilities meet my conditions, meet my constraints. So this is 1/2. If I roll a die, I have a 1/2 chance of getting an even number.."
Math,"And so this is sometimes the event in question, right over here, is picking the yellow marble. I'll even write down the word ""picking."" And when you say probability, it's really just a way of measuring the likelihood that something is going to happen."
Math,"And the way we're going to think about it is how many of the outcomes from this trial, from this picking a marble out of a bag, how many meet our constraints, satisfy this event? And how many possible outcomes are there? So let me write the possible outcomes right over here, so possible outcomes. And you'll see it's actually a very straightforward idea. But I'll just make sure that we understand all the words that people might say, so the set of all the possible outcomes."
Math,"Well, there's three yellow marbles. So I could pick that yellow marble, that yellow marble, or that yellow marble, that yellow marble. These are clearly all yellow. There's two red marbles in the bag. So I could pick that red marble or that red marble. There's two green marbles in the bag. So I could pick that green marble or that green marble. And then there's one blue marble in the bag. There's one blue marble. So this is all the possible outcomes."
Math,"And sometimes this is referred to as the sample space, the set of all the possible outcomes. Fancy word for just a simple idea, that the sample space, when I pick something out of the bag, and that picking out of the bag is called a trial, there's 8 possible things I can do. So when I think about the probability of picking a yellow marble, I want to think about, well, what are all of the possibilities? Well, there's 8 possibilities, 8 possibilities for my trial."
Math,"So the number of outcomes, number of possible outcomes, you could view it as the size of the sample space, number of possible outcomes, And it's as simple as saying, look, I have 8 marbles. And then you say, well, how many of those marbles meet my constraint, that satisfy this event here? Well, there's 3 marbles that satisfy my event. There's 3 outcomes that will allow this event to occur, I guess is one way to say it."
Math,"So there's 3 right over here, so number that satisfy the event or the constraint right over here. So it's very simple ideas. Many times the words make them more complicated than they need to. If I say, what's the probability of picking a yellow marble? Well, how many different types of marbles can I pick? Well, there's 8 different marbles I could pick. And then how many of them are yellow? Well, there's 3 of them that are actually yellow.."
Math,"So that's my bag, and we're going to assume that it's a transparent bag, so it looks like a vase. But we have 9 red marbles, so let me draw 9 red marbles. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 red marbles. They're kind of orange-ish, but it does the job. 2 blue marbles, so we have 1 blue marble, 2 blue marbles. And then we have 3 green marbles, let me draw those 3, so 1, 2, 3."
Math,"What is the probability of randomly selecting a non-blue marble from the bag? So maybe we mix them all up, and we have an equal probability of selecting any one of these. And the way you just think about it is what fraction of all of the possible events meet our constraint? So let's just think about all of the possible events first. How many different possible marbles can we take out? Well that's just the total number of marbles there are."
Math,"So are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 possible marbles. So this is the number of possibilities. And then we just have to think what fraction of those possibilities meet our constraints. And the other way you could have gotten 14 is just taking 9 plus 2 plus 3. So what number of those possibilities meet our constraints? And remember, our constraint is selecting a non-blue marble from the bag."
Math,"Another way to think about it is a red or green marble, because the only other two colors we have are red and green. So how many non-blue marbles are there? Well, there's a couple ways to think about it. You could say there's 14 total marbles. 2 are blue. So there are going to be 14 minus 2, which is 12 non-blue marbles. Or you could just count them. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. So there are 12 non-blue marbles."
Math,"So these are the possibilities that meet our constraints over all of the possibilities. And then if we want to-- this isn't in simplified form right here, since both 12 and 14 are divisible by 2. So let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2, and you get 6 over 7. So we have a 6/7 chance of selecting a non-blue marble from the bag. Let's do another one."
Math,"If a number is randomly chosen from the following list, what is the probability that the number is a multiple of 5? So once again, we want to find the fraction of the total possibilities that meet our constraint, and our constraint is being a multiple of 5. So how many total possibilities are there? Let's think about that. How many do we have? Well that's just the total number of numbers we have to pick from, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. So there are 12 possibilities."
Math,"We have an equal chance of picking any one of these 12. Now which of these 12 are a multiple of 5? So let's do this in a different color. So let me pick out the multiples of 5. 32 is not a multiple of 5, 49 is not a multiple of 5. 55 is a multiple of 5. Really, we're just looking for the numbers that in the ones place you either have a 5 or a 0. 55 is a multiple of 5, 30 is a multiple of 5, that's 6 times 5. 55 is 11 times 5. Not 56, not 28."
Math,"This is clearly 5 times 10, this is 8 times 5, this is the same number again, also 8 times 5. So all of these are multiples of 5. 45, that's 9 times 5. 3 is not a multiple of 5. 25, clearly 5 times 5. So I've circled all the multiples of 5. So of all the possibilities, the ones that meet our constraint of being a multiple of 5, there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 possibilities. So 7 meet our constraint. So in this example, the probability of a selecting a number that is a multiple of 5 is 7/12."
Math,"Let's do another one. the circumference of a circle is 36 pi. Let's draw this circle. The circumference of a circle is 36 pi, so let's say the circle looks-- I can draw a neater circle than that. So let's say the circle looks something like that. And its circumference-- we have to be careful here, they're giving us interesting-- the circumference is 36 pi. Then they tell us that contained in that circle is a smaller circle with area 16 pi."
Math,"So inside the bigger circle, we have a smaller circle that has an area of 16 pi. A point is selected at random from inside the larger circle, so we're going to randomly select some point in this larger circle. What is the probability that the point also lies in this smaller circle? So here's a little bit interesting, because you actually have an infinite number of points in both of these circles, because it's not kind of a separate balls or marbles, like we saw in the first example, or separate numbers."
Math,"There's actually an infinite number of points you could pick here. And so, when we talk about the probability that the point also lies in the smaller circle, we're really thinking about the percentage of the points in the larger circle that are also in the smaller circle."
Math,"Or another way to think about it is the probability that if we pick a point from this larger circle, the probably that it's also in the smaller circle is really just going to be the percentage of the larger circle that is the smaller circle. I know that might sound confusing, but we're really just have to figure out the areas for both of them, and it's really just going to be the ratios so let's think about that."
Math,"So there's a temptation to just use this 36 pi up here, but we have to remember, this was the circumference, and we need to figure out the area of both of these circles. And so for area, we need to know the radius, because area is pi r squared. So we can figure out the radius from the circumference by saying, well, circumference is equal to 2 times pi times the radius of the circle."
Math,"Or if you say 36 pi, which we were told is the circumference, is equal to 2 times pi times the radius, we can divide both sides by 2 pi, and on the left hand side, 36 divided by 2 is 18 the pi's cancel out, we get our radius as being equal to 18 for this larger circle. So if we want to know its area, its area is going to be pi r squared, which is equal to pi times 18 squared. And let's figure out what 18 squared is."
Math,"18 times 18, 8 times 8 is 64, eight times 1 is 8 plus 6 is 14, and then we put that 0 there because we're now in the tens place, 1 times 8 is 8, 1 times 1 is 1. And really, this is a 10 times the 10, and that's why it gives us 100. Anyway, 4 plus 0 is a 4, 4 plus 8 is a 12, and then 1 plus 1 plus 1 is a 3, so it's 324. So the area here is equal to pi times 324, or we could say 324 pi."
Math,"So the area of the entire larger circle, the part that I shaded in yellow, including what's kind of under this orange circle, if you want to view it that way, this area right over here is equal to 324 pi. So the probability that a point that we select from this larger circle is also in the smaller circle is really just a percentage of the larger circle that is the smaller circle."
Math,"So our probability-- I'll just write it like this-- the probability that the point also lies in the smaller circle-- so all of that stuff I'll put in it. The probability of that is going to be equal to the percentage of this larger circle that is this smaller one, and that's going to be-- or we could say the fraction of the larger circle's area that is the smaller circle's area. So it's going to be 16 pi over 324 pi. And the pi's cancel out, and it looks like both of them are divisible by 4."
Math,"If we divide the numerator by 4, we get 4, if we divide the denominator by 4, what do we get? 4 goes into 320 80 times, it goes into 4 once, so we get an 81. So a probability-- I didn't even draw this to scale, this area is actually much smaller when you do it to scale-- the probability that if you were to randomly select a point from the larger circle, that it also lies in the smaller one is the ratio of their areas, the ratio of the smaller circle to the larger one."
Math,"And that is 4/81, I guess is the best way to say it.."
Math,"Well, maybe the simplest example, or one of the simplest examples is if you're flipping a coin. And let's say in theory you're flipping a completely fair coin and you're flipping it in a way that is completely fair. Well, there you know you have two outcomes. Either heads will be on top or tails will be on top."
Math,"So theoretically you say, ""well, look, ""if I want to figure out the probability ""of getting a heads, in theory I have two ""equally likely possibilities, and heads ""is one of those two equally likely possibilities."" So you have a 1/2 probability. Once again, if in theory the coin is definitely fair, it's a fair coin and it's flipped in a very fair way, then this is true. You have a 1/2 probability. We could also do that with rolling a die."
Math,"A fair six-sided die is going to have six possible outcomes: one, two, three, four, five and six. And if you said ""what is the probability of getting ""a result that is greater than or equal to three?"" Well, we have six equally likely possibilities. You see them there. In theory, if they're all equally likely, four of these possibilities meet our constraint of being greater than or equal to three. We have four out of the six of these possibilities meet our constraints."
Math,"So we have a 2/3, 4/6 is the same thing as 2/3, probability of it happening. Now these are for simple things, like die or flipping a coin. And if you have fancy computers or spreadsheets you can even say ""hey, ""I'm gonna flip a coin a bunch of times ""and do all the combinatorics"" and all that. But there are things that are even beyond what a computer can find the exact theoretical probability for."
Math,"Let's say you are playing a game, say football, American football, and you wanted to figure out the probability of scoring a certain number of points. Well that isn't very simple because that's going to involve what human beings are doing. Minds are very unpredictable, how people will respond to things. The weather might get involved. Someone might fall sick. The ball might be wet, or just how the ball might interact with some player's jersey."
Math,"Who knows what might actually result in the score being one point this way, or seven points this way, or seven points that way. So for situations like that, it makes more sense to think more in terms of experimental probability. In experimental probability, we're really just trying to get an estimate of something happening, based on data and experience that we've had in the past. For example, let's say you had data from your football team and it's many games into the season."
Math,"You've been tabulating the number of points, you have a histogram of the number of games that scored between zero and nine points. You had two games that scored between zero and nine points. Four games that scored from ten to 19 points. You had five games that went from 20 to 29 points. You had three games that went from 30 to 39 points. Then you had two games that go from 40 to 49 points. Now let's say for your next game, let's see how many games you've had so far."
Math,"The game so far is two plus four plus five plus three plus two, so this is six, plus five is 11. Eleven plus five is 16. So you've had 16 games so far this season and you're curious, for your 17th game, you want to figure out, what is the probability your points are greater than or equal to 30? The probability your points are greater than or equal to 30 for game 17. Once again, this is very hard to find the exact theoretical probability. You don't know exactly, you can't predict the future."
Math,"You don't know who's gonna show up sick, how humans are going to interact with each other. Maybe someone screams something in the stand that just phases the quarterback in exactly the right or the wrong way. You don't know. This is an incredibly, incredibly complex system, what might happen over the course of an entire football game. But you can estimate what'll happen based on what you've seen in your past experience. It depends on the defense of the team you're facing and all that."
Math,"So it's not going to be super exact, but you could estimate, based on experiments, based on what you've seen in the past. Here, the experimental probability, and I would say the estimate, because you shouldn't walk away saying, ""okay, we absolutely know for sure ""that if we conducted this next game ""experiment n times that it's definitely ""gonna turn out the same."" Because this might be the toughest defense that you play all year, this might be the easiest defense that you play all year."
Math,"But if you look at what's happened in the past, out of the 16 games so far, there have been three games, these three plus these two games, where you scored greater than or equal to 30 points. So five out of the 16 situations, you've scored more than that. An estimate of your probability, you could view this as maybe your experimental probability, of scoring more than 30 points based on past experience, based on past experience, is five, five out of the 16 games you've done this in the past."
Math,"So you'd say it's 5/16. Now I want to really have you take this with a grain of salt. You should not say ""okay, I know for sure ""there's a 5/16 probability of us winning this game."" Because you only have some data points, every team you play is going to be different, it's going to be different weather conditions, people are going to be in different moods, etc., etc. This is really just an estimate. I feel a little bit of reservations even calling it a probability."
Math,"I would just say that this has been true of five out of 16 games in the past. So it's an indicator of what might be. You might say, ""okay, based on experience, it's more ""likely than not that we don't score more than 30 points."" But it's really just based on experiential data, what's happened in the season. Even the makeup of your football team might have changed. You might have gotten a different coach, you might have learned to train better."
Math,"Who knows, one of your team members might have grown by three inches. All of these things. So all of this has to be taken with a grain of salt. But this is one way of thinking about it. At least having a sense of what may happen.."
Math,"There are six possibilities. We could get a one, a two, a three, a four, a five or a six. Now let's say we ask ourselves what is the probability of rolling a number that is less than or equal to two? What is this going to be? Well, there are six equally likely possibilities. Rolling less than or equal to two, well, that means I'm either rolling a one or a two. So two, one, two, of the six equally likely possibilities meet my constraints."
Math,"So there is a 2/6 probability of rolling a number less than or equal to two. Or I can just rewrite that as an equivalent fraction. I could say there's a 1/3 probability. I could go either way. Now let's also ask ourselves another question. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than or equal to three? Once again, there are six equally likely possibilities. How many of them involve rolling greater than or equal to three? Let's see, one, two, three, four, these possibilities right over here."
Math,"Throw a three, a four, a five or six. So four out of the six equally likely possibilities. Or I could rewrite this as an equivalent fraction, as 2/3. So what's more likely? Rolling a number that's less than or equal to two? Or rolling a number that's greater than or equal to three? Well, you can see it right over here. The probability of rolling greater than or equal to three is 2/3 while the probability of rolling less than or equal to two is only 1/3. This number is greater."
Math,"So this has a greater probability or another way of thinking about it, rolling greater than or equal to three is more likely than rolling less than or equal to two. In fact, not only is it more likely, you see that 2/3 is twice 1/3. This right over here is twice as likely. You're twice as likely to roll a number greater than or equal to three than you are to roll a number less than or equal to two. You can even see right over here."
Math,"You have twice as many possibilities of the six equally likely ones, four versus two. Four versus two here. So you say, ""Okay, I get it Sal."" If the probability is a larger number, the event is more likely. It makes sense and in this case, it's twice. The number is twice as large so it's twice as likely. But what's the range of possible probabilities? How low can a probability get and how high can a probability get? Let's think about the first question."
Math,"How low can a probability go? How low, so what's the lowest probability that you can imagine for anything? Well, let's give ourselves a little bit of an experiment. Let's ask ourselves the probability of rolling a seven. Well, once and pause the video and try to figure it out on your own. Well, there are six equally likely possibilities. How many of them involve rolling a seven? Well, none of them. It's impossible to roll a seven. So none of the six. We could say this probability is zero."
Math,"If you see a probability of zero, someone says the probability of that thing happening is zero, that means it's impossible. That means in no world can that happen, if it's exactly zero. This right here, the probability is zero. That means it is impossible. It is impossible. Now how high can a probability get? How high can a probability get? Well, let's think about it. Let's say probability of rolling any number from one to six."
Math,"Well, I have six equally likely possibilities and any one of those six meets this constraint. I would have rolled a number, any number, from one to six, including one and six. So there are six equally likely possibilities. So the probability is one. Someone says the probability is zero, it's impossible. If someone says the probability is one, that means it's definitely going to happen. It's definitely going to happen. So the maximum probability for anything is one. The minimum probability is zero."
Math,"You don't have negative probabilities and you don't have probabilities greater than one. You might be thinking, ""Wait, wait. ""I've seen things that they look like ""larger numbers than one."" You're probably thinking of seeing this as a percentage. One as a percentage, you can also write this as 100%. This right over here as a percentage is 100%. 100% is the same thing as one. You can't have a probability at 110%. 110% would be the same thing as 1.1."
Math,"Now this is really interesting because you'd often see someone say, ""Hey, something for sure is going to happen ""or something is impossible."" But even a lot of the things that we think for sure are going to happen, there's some probability or some chance that they don't happen. For example, you might hear someone say, ""Well, what's the probability that the sun ""will rise tomorrow?"" Well, you might say it's going to happen for sure."
Math,"But you gotta remember some type of weird cosmological event might occur, some kind of strange, huge planet-sized object in space might come and knock the earth out of its rotation. Who knows what could happen? All these have a very low likelihood. Very, very, very, very, very, very low likelihood. But it's hard to say it's exactly one. If I had said the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow, instead of saying one, I would probably say it's 0.999. I would throw a lot of nines over here."
Math,"I wouldn't say it's 0.9 repeating forever. Actually, there's an interesting proof that 0.9 repeating forever is actually the same thing as one, which is a little counterintuitive. But I would say there's a very high probability. But even if it's such a high probability, it's going to be close to one. But I won't say it's exactly the one because there could be some kind of quasar that blasts us with gamma rays. Or who knows what might happen? But it's a very, very high probability."
Math,"Same thing, the probability here, probability that my pet gopher could write the next great novel. Writes a novel. Actually not just a novel, a great novel. Just a novel wouldn't be that impressive for a gopher. Let's say great novel. Well, once again, this gopher sitting there typing at a keyboard. It would seem somewhat random but there is some probability that it actually does it. There's some chance it does it. So I would put this at a very low and I wouldn't say it's exactly zero."
Math,"If we had an infinite number of gophers doing this forever, who knows, maybe one of them might write that great novel. In fact, if we had an infinite number doing it forever, eventually, a lot of people would say, at some point you would. But just one gopher trying to write a novel, what's the probability they write a great novel? I would say it's pretty close to zero. I'd throw a lot of zeros here, and at some point you might have something like this."
Math,"Once again, not absolutely impossible but pretty close to, pretty, pretty close to impossible. So big takeaways? Higher probability, more likely. The lowest probability you can get to? Zero. Highest probability is one. If your probability is more, when you're talking about coin flipping. If you say the probability of heads for a fair coin and you say, ""Well, that's 1/2,"" that means it's equally likely to happen or not happen."
Math,"Anything that has a larger probability than 1/2, it's more likely to happen than not. Anything that has a probability of less than 1/2, it's less likely to happen than not.."
Math,"There are going to be 50 magenta marbles, and there's also going to be 50 blue marbles. And what you do is, you have these 100 marbles in there, half of them magenta, half of them blue. And before picking a marble out, and you're gonna be blindfolded when you pick a marble out, you shake the bag really good to, so you think, mix them up a little bit."
Math,"And so, if you were to say theoretically, what is the probability, if you stuck your hand in and you're not looking, what is the probability of picking a magenta? I feel the need to write magenta in magenta. What is the probability of picking a magenta marble? Well, theoretically there's 100 equally likely possibilities, there's 100 marbles in the bag. And 50 of them involve picking a magenta. So, 50 out of 100, when this is the same thing as a 1/2 probability."
Math,"So you could say, well, ""Theoretically, ""there is a 1/2 probability, I just did the math."" If you say these are 100 equally likely possibilities, 50 of them are picking magenta. Now let's say you actually start doing the experiment. So you literally take a bag with 50 magenta marbles, 50 blue marbles, and then you start picking the marbles, and then you see what marble color you picked, and you put it back in, and then you do it again."
Math,"And so, let's say that after every time you put your hand in the bag and you take something out of the bag, and you observe what it is, we're gonna call that an experiment. So, after 10 experiments, let's say that you you have picked out seven magenta and three blue. So, is this strange that out of the first 10 experiments, you haven't picked out exactly half of them being magenta, you've picked out seven magenta, and then the other three were blue. Well no, this is definitely a reasonable thing."
Math,"If the true probability of picking out a magenta is 1/2, it's definitely possible that you could still pick out seven magenta, that just happened to be what your fingers touched."
Math,"And this isn't a lot of experiments, it's completely reasonable that out of 10, yeah, you could have, later on in statistics we'll define these things in more detail, but there's enough variation in where you might pick that you're not going to always get, especially with only 10 experiments, you're not definitely going to get exactly 1/2. Instead of having five magenta, it's completely reasonable to have seven magenta. So, this really wouldn't cause me a lot of pause."
Math,"I still wouldn't question what I did here when I calculated this theoretical probability. But let's say you have a lot of time on your hands. And let's say after 10,000 trials here, after 10,000 experiments, and remember the experiment; you're sticking your hand in the bag without looking, your fingers kind of feeling around, picks out a marble, and you observe the marble and you record what you found. And so, let's say after 10,000 experiments, you get 7,000 magenta."
Math,"Actually I'm gonna do slightly different numbers, so let me make it even more extreme. Let's say you get 8,000 magenta and you have 2,000 blue. Now this is interesting, because here what you're seeing experimentally seems to be very different. And now you have a large number of trials right over here, not just 10. 10 is completely reasonable that, hey you know, I got seven magenta and three blue instead of five and five, but now you've done 10,000."
Math,"You would've expected if this was the true probability, you would've expected that half of these would've been magenta, only 5,000 magenta and 5,000 blue, but you got 8,000 magenta. Now, this is within the realm of possibility if the true probability of picking a magenta is 1/2, but it's very unlikely that you would've gotten this result with this many experiments, this many trials if the true probability was 1/2."
Math,"Here your experimental probability is showing, look, out of 10,000 trials, experimental probability here is you had 10,000 trials, or 10,000 experiments I guess you could say. And and in 8,000 of them, you got a magenta marble. And so, this is going to be 80%, or 8/10. So, there seems to be a difference here. The reason why I would take this more seriously is that you had a lot of trials here, you did this 10,000 times."
Math,"If the true probability was one half, it's very low likelihood that you would've gotten this many magenta. So, when you think about it you're like, ""What's going on here, what are ""possible explanations for this?"" This, I wouldn't have fretted about, after 10 experiments, not a big deal. But after 10,000, this would have caused me pause. Well, why would this happen, I mixed up the bag every time."
Math,"And there're some different possibilities; maybe the blue marbles are slightly heavier, and so when you shake the bag up enough, the blue marbles settled to the bottom, and you're more likely to pick a magenta marble. Maybe the blue marbles have a slightly different texture to them, in which case, maybe they slip out of your hands, or they're less likely to be gripped on, and so you're more likely to pick a magenta."
Math,"So, I don't know the explanation, I don't know what's going on in that bag, but if I thought theoretically that the probability should be 1/2, because half of the marbles are magenta, but I'm seeing through my experiments that 80% of what I'm picking out, especially if I did 10,000 of them, if I did this 10,000 times, well, this is going to cause me some pause. I would really start to think about whether it's truly equally likely for me to pick out a red, a magenta versus a blue."
Math,Something else must be going on..
Math,"It looks like in four of them, you've spun an elephant. Two of them, you have this mouse running away from something, and then in one of them, you have this monkey doing some type of acrobatics, fair enough. Now let's pose ourselves an interesting question. At least I think it's an interesting question. Let's say we were to spin the spinner 210 times. So we're going to spin 210... We're going to spin that spinner 210 times. And I want you to make a prediction. I want you to predict..."
Math,"I want you to predict the number of times... Number of times... We get an elephant. We get an elephant... Number of times we get an elephant, out of the 210 times. So why don't you to have a go at it? All right, so you've, I'm assuming, like always, pause the video and then had a try. So one way to think about it, is, well, for one spin, what is the probability of getting an elephant? So let's do this, one spin."
Math,"So for one spin, what is the probability of getting an elephant? Well let's see, we have already talked about, this is a fair spinner. There are seven equally likely possibilities. And then how many involve getting an elephant? Well, so we have one, two, three, four. Four out of the seven equally likely possibilities involve us getting an elephant."
Math,"So one reasonable thing to do, and this is actually what I would do, is go, look, a 4/7 probability means I should expect that 4/7 of the time, especially if I'm doing it over, and over, and over again, it's a reasonable expectation that, hey, 4/7 of the time, I will get an elephant. I've just calculated the theoretical probability here, based on this being a fair spinner. And that should inform, that if I were to do a bunch of experiments, that 4/7 of the time that I should see me getting the elephant."
Math,"So it would be a reasonable prediction to say well, look, I'm going to spin this thing 210 times, and I would expect that 4/7 of those 210 times, I would get an elephant. And so, let's think about what this is. 210 times 4/7, 210 divided by seven is 30. 30 times 40 is 120. So 120 times. My prediction, or maybe your prediction was this as well, I think it's a reasonable prediction, is that if I spin it 210 times, that I'm going to get an elephant 120 times."
Math,"That's very important to think about, what this is saying, and this is not saying. Is it possible that I get an elephant 121 times, or maybe 119 times? Sure, sure, it's completely reasonable that you might get something different than this. In fact, there's some probability that you get no elephant."
Math,"If you consider getting an elephant lucky, that you just happen to keep landing on the monkey or one of the mice, and that's a very low probability that that would happen if you spun it 210 times, but it is possible. So it's important to realize that this is just a prediction. There's actually a possibility that you might get an elephant on all 210 spins. Once again, that's a low probability, but it is possible. So this isn't saying that you're definitely going to get the elephant 120 times."
Math,"In fact, it's very reasonable, that you might get the elephant 123 times, or 128 times, or 110 times, or even 90 times. These are all completely reasonable things to happen. All you would say, is that, look, if I had to predict it, this, out of all of the different... I can get the elephant anywhere between zero and 210 times, out of all of those possibilities, before I even start spinning, I'll say, okay, I think that this is the most reasonable one, that I'm going to get it 4/7 of the time."
Math,"But it's not saying that, hey, that I'm definitely going to get it 120 times, it's not saying that 118 times, or 129 times aren't reasonably possible as well. It's just saying, look, this is a reasonable prediction. I'm using the experimental probability, 4/7 probability, and so, if I'm going to do something 210 times, well, I could expect that it's going to happen 4/7 of the time. I don't know for sure that it's going to happen 4/7 of the time, but that is a reasonable prediction to make.."
Math,"And so you decide to conduct a study. You want to figure out the probability of there being lines of different sizes when you go to the frozen yogurt store after school, exactly at four o'clock PM. So in your study, the next 50 times you observe, you go to the frozen yogurt store at four PM, you make a series of observations. You observe the size of the line. So, let me make two columns here, line size is the left column, and on the right column, let's say this is the number of times observed."
Math,"So, times observed, observed. All right, times observed, my handwriting is, O-B-S-E-R-V-E-D, all right, times observed. All right, so let's first think about it. Okay, so you go and you say, hey look, I see no people in line, exactly, or you see no people in line, exactly 24 times. You see one person in line exactly 18 times, and you see two people in line exactly eight times. And, in your 50 visits, you don't see more, you never see more than two people in line."
Math,"I guess this is a very efficient cashier at this frozen yogurt store. So based on this, based on what you have observed, what would be your estimate of the probabilities of finding no people in line, one people in line, or two people in line, at four PM on the days after school that you visit the frozen yogurt store? You only visit it on weekdays where there are schooldays."
Math,"So what's the probability of there being no line, a one person line, or a two person line when you visit at four PM on a school day? Well, all you can do is estimate the true probability, the true theoretical probability. We don't know what that is, but you've done 50 observations here right."
Math,"I know that this adds up to 50, 18 plus eight is 26, 26 plus 24 is 50, so you've done 50 observations here and so you can figure out, well what are the relative frequencies of having zero people? What is the relative frequency of one person, or the relative frequency of two people in line? And then we can use that as the estimates for the probability. So let's do that. So, probability estimate. I'll do it in the next column."
Math,"So probability, probability estimate, and once again we can do that by looking at the relative frequency. The relative frequency of zero, well we observed that 24 times out of 50. So, 24 out of 50 is the same thing as 0.48, or you could even say that this is 48%. Now, what's the relative frequency of seeing one person in line? Well you observed that 18 out of the 50 visits, 18 out of the 50 visits, that would be a relative frequency, 18 divided by 50 is 0.36, which is 36% of your visits."
Math,"And then, finally, the relative frequency of seeing a two person line, that was eight out of the 50 visits, and so that it 0.16, and that is equal to 16% of the visits. And so, there's interesting things here. Remember, these are estimates of the probability. You're doing this by essentially sampling what the line on 50 different days, you don't know, it's not gonna always be exactly this, but it's a good estimate, you did it 50 times."
Math,"And so based on this, you'd say, well I'd estimate the probability of having a zero person line as 48%. I'd estimate the probability of having a one person line as 36%. I'd estimate the probability of having a two person line is 16%, or is 0.16. It's important to realize that these are legitimate probabilities. Remember, to be a probability, it has to be between zero and one, it has to be zero and one."
Math,"And if you look at all of the possible events, it should add up to one, because at least based on your observations, these are the possibilities. Obviously in a real world, it might be some kind of crazy thing where more people go in line."
Math,"But at least based on the events that you've seen, these three different events, and these are the only three that you've observed, based on your observations, these three should add, cause these are the only three things you've observed, they should add up to one, and they do add up to one. Let's see, 36 plus 16 is 52, 52 plus 48, they add up to one. Now, if once you do this, you might do something interesting. You might say, okay, you know what, over the next two years, you plan on visiting 500 times."
Math,"So visiting 500 times, so based on your estimates of the probability of having no line, of a one person line, or a two person line, how many times in your next 500 visits would you expect there to be a two person line? Based on your observations so far."
Math,"Well, it's reasonable to say, well a good estimate of the number of times you'll see a two person line when you visit 500 times, well you say, well there's gonna be 500 times, and it's a reasonable expectation, based on your estimate of the probability that 0.16 of the time, you will see a two person line. Or you could say eight out of every 50 times. And so what is this going to be? Let's see, 500 divided by 50 is just 10, so you would expect that 80 out of the 500 times you would see a two person line."
Math,"Now to be clear, I would be shocked if it's exactly 80 ends up being the case, but this is actually a very good expectation based on your observations. It is completely possible, first of all, that your observations were off. That you, you know, that it's just the random chance that you happened to observe this many or this few times that there were two people in line. So that could be off."
Math,"But even if these are very good estimates, it's possible that something, that you see a two person line 85 out of the 500 times, or 65 out of the 500 times. All of those things are possible."
Math,"And it's always very important to keep in mind, you're estimating the true probability here, which it's very hard to know for sure what the true probability is, but you can make estimates based on sampling the line on different days, by making these observations, by having these experiments so to speak, each of these observations you could use in experiment, and then you can use those to set an expectation."
Math,"But none of these things do you know for sure, that they're definitely gonna be exactly 80 out of the next 500 times.."
Math,"So a very simple trial might be a coin flip. So if you're talking about a coin flip, well then the sample space is going to be the set of all the possible outcomes. So you could get a heads or you could get a tails. That right over here is the sample space for the coin flip. And it's very useful because, for example, if these are equally likely outcomes and you say well what's the probability of the event of a heads, you say okay that's one out of the two equally likely outcomes."
Math,"Or you could even construct, once you know all of the possible outcomes even if they aren't equally likely, you could say well let's create a probability distribution. We at least know what the sample space is. We know what the possible outcomes are, now let's think about the probability of each of those outcomes. But a lot of times when people talk about sample spaces, they're often, they tend to be most useful, I would say, when you have equally likely outcomes like in the case of a fair coin flip."
Math,"Because then from the sample space, it's fairly straight forward to think about the probability of various events. But this is a simple sample space right over here, but let's make things a little bit more interesting. Let's imagine a world, so let's just put this aside a little bit. Let's imagine a world where there's a bakery and at that bakery there are three types, three flavors of cupcakes, but there's also three different sizes of cupcakes."
Math,"So now we're essentially looking at two different ways in which the thing that we're going to be sampling can vary. So what we're doing, let me write this down. So we have our flavors, flavors of cupcakes at this bakery. And let's say that you have chocolate, chocolate, you have, let's say there's strawberry, strawberry, and let's say that there is vanilla, there is vanilla. And they come in three different sizes. So sizes. Sizes could be small, I'll just write it out, small, medium, or large."
Math,"So if you were, and let's say each of these flavors come in each of these sizes. Or you could view it the other way around, each of these sizes come in all three flavors."
Math,"So now how do you construct the sample space? If you were to say, look I'm gonna go, you know, I'm gonna blindfold myself and walk into this bakery and randomly somehow pickup a cupcake and my fingers can't tell the flavor or the size of the cupcake, what are the possible, what are the possible outcomes for the cupcake I'll pick? And the outcome would be both the flavor and the size of the cupcake. Well there's a bunch of ways to think about this. One way is you could draw a tree."
Math,"You could say, okay well I'm gonna pick three different flavors. I could either pick chocolate, chocolate, I'm gonna pick strawberry, strawberry, or I'm going to pick vanilla, vanilla. And then for each of those flavors, I'm only gonna pick a small, medium, or large. So you could say small, medium, large. Small, so this is a small chocolate, this is a medium chocolate, this is a large chocolate. This is a small strawberry, medium strawberry, large strawberry."
Math,"This is a small vanilla, medium vanilla, large vanilla. And so you see there's nine possible outcomes. Once again, this is a medium chocolate. You picked a chocolate and it was a medium one. This is a large vanilla. You picked a vanilla, and it is a large one. And you could have done it the other way around. You could have said, well okay, I'm going to either pick a small, medium, or large and then for each of those I'm gonna pick either a chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla."
Math,"And I'll just use the first letters. So I'm either gonna pick a chocolate, a strawberry, or a vanilla. When I write the S over here in this magenta color, I'm talking about the flavor and if I write the S in green, I'm talking about small. So here you can have, if you have a medium cupcake, it could be chocolate, it could be strawberry, or it could be vanilla. If you have a large cupcake it could be chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla. So for example, this was a medium, chocolate cupcake."
Math,"Over here a medium, chocolate cupcake is this one. It's medium, chocolate. It would be that one over here. So you could use these kind of a tree diagram like this to think about the sample space, to think about the nine possible outcomes here. But you could also, you could also do a, I guess you could say grid, where you could write the flavors, so you could have chocolate, chocolate, actually, let me just write the, well no, let me write them out."
Math,"Actually, let me just, let me just write the letters since this is gonna take a long time to do. So you could have the flavors chocolate, strawberry, vanilla. So that's along that axis. And then you have your sizes. You can have a small, a medium, or large. And you can set up a grid here. So this is another way to do it. And notice this grid has nine boxes. So let's look at it. So set up the grid. Set up the grid. And so what is this one going to be? This is a small chocolate. Small. Small chocolate."
Math,"Small chocolate. What is this one? This is going to be a small, a small strawberry, A small strawberry. And you could just keep constructing like this where everything in this row, there are all about small. Do it in the... This is small. I'm having trouble changing colors. Alright (laughing). There is a small and then this is a small, this is a small vanilla. This color changing is really, it's a difficult thing. Small vanilla. And all of these, these are all, this would be a medium chocolate."
Math,"Medium strawberry. Medium vanilla. Large chocolate, large strawberry, large vanilla. And once again you have nine outcomes. This is another way to think about all of the possible outcomes when you're looking at these two ways in which my cupcakes could vary. Another way, a third way that you could do it, is you could literally just construct a table. Well you could say, okay I could have a chocolate, actually I'm going to use the letters again. So let's say we make, this is the flavor column."
Math,"And then this is the size column. Size column. And so you could say I could have a chocolate that is, so let's see, there's three types of chocolate that I could have. And they could be they could be small, medium, or large. You could say there's three types of, three types of strawberry. It could be small, medium, or large. So let me write that in. Small, medium, large. Or you could say oh, there's three types of vanilla. There's three types of, I'm color changing again. Three types of vanilla."
Math,"Once again, it could be small, medium, or large. So you have these nine possibilities. Now, sample space, the sample space isn't telling you if they're equally likely or not."
Math,"It's just telling you, hey, if you're gonna do an experiment, what are all the different possibilities, the possible outcomes for that experiment? Now in the case where they are equally likely, it can be very, very useful because you can say you could do something like, if you said okay, it's equally likely to pick any one of these nine outcomes, you could say well what's the probability of, what's the probability of getting something that is either small or chocolate? And so you could see well how many of those events out of the total actually meet that constraint? But we'll do more of that in future videos."
Math,"That's just a little bit of a clue of why we even care about things like sample spaces. Especially sample spaces like this, where we're looking along two ways or multiple ways that something can vary. And these types of sample spaces in particular are called compound sample spaces. So these right over here, this is a compound sample space, because we're looking at two different ways that it can vary. Not just a heads or tails, it can vary by size or by flavor."
Math,And you can even have compound sample spaces that vary in more than two ways..
Math,"A 2 and a 2, that is doubles. A 3 and a 3, a 4 and a 4, a 5 and a 5, a 6 and a 6, all of those are instances of doubles. So the event in question is rolling doubles on two six-sided dice numbered from 1 to 6. So let's think about all of the possible outcomes. Or another way to think about it, let's think about the sample space here. So what can we roll on the first die. So let me write this as die number 1. What are the possible rolls? Well, they're numbered from 1 to 6."
Math,"It's a six-sided die, so I can get a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6. Now let's think about the second die, so die number 2. Well, exact same thing. I could get a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6. Now, given these possible outcomes for each of the die, we can now think of the outcomes for both die. So, for example, in this-- let me draw a grid here just to make it a little bit neater. So let me draw a line there and then a line right over there."
Math,"Let me draw actually several of these, just so that we could really do this a little bit clearer. So let me draw a full grid. All right. And then let me draw the vertical lines, only a few more left. There we go. Now, all of this top row, these are the outcomes where I roll a 1 on the first die. So I roll a 1 on the first die. These are all of those outcomes. And this would be I run a 1 on the second die, but I'll fill that in later. These are all of the outcomes where I roll a 2 on the first die."
Math,"This is where I roll a 3 on the first die. 4-- I think you get the idea-- on the first die. And then a 5 on the first to die. And then finally, this last row is all the outcomes where I roll a 6 on the first die. Now, we can go through the columns, and this first column is where we roll a 1 on the second die. This is where we roll a 2 on the second die. So let's draw that out, write it out, and fill in the chart. Here's where we roll a 3 on the second die."
Math,"This is a comma that I'm doing between the two numbers. Here is where we have a 4. And then here is where we roll a 5 on the second die, just filling this in. This last column is where we roll a 6 on the second die. Now, every one of these represents a possible outcome. This outcome is where we roll a 1 on the first die and a 1 on the second die. This outcome is where we roll a 3 on the first die, a 2 on the second die. This outcome is where we roll a 4 on the first die and a 5 on the second die."
Math,"And you can see here, there are 36 possible outcomes, 6 times 6 possible outcomes. Now, with this out of the way, how many of these outcomes satisfy our criteria of rolling doubles on two six-sided dice? How many of these outcomes are essentially described by our event? Well, we see them right here. Doubles, well, that's rolling a 1 and 1, that's a 2 and a 2, a 3 and a 3, a 4 and a 4, a 5 and a 5, and a 6 and a 6."
Math,"So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 events satisfy this event, or are the outcomes that are consistent with this event. Now given that, let's answer our question."
Math,"What is the probability of rolling doubles on two six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6? Well, the probability is going to be equal to the number of outcomes that satisfy our criteria, or the number of outcomes for this event, which are 6-- we just figured that out-- over the total-- I want to do that pink color-- number of outcomes, over the size of our sample space. So this right over here, we have 36 total outcomes. So we have 36 outcomes, and if you simplify this, 6/36 is the same thing as 1/6."
Math,So the probability of rolling doubles on two six-sided dice numbered from 1 to 6 is 1/6..
Math,"So, the question that I ask to you is, how many types of, I guess, flower and pots put together can you walk out of this florist store with? For example, you could get a rose and a brown pot, you could get a rose and a green pot. Or you could get a yellow pot that has a sunflower in it. Or a yellow pot that has a lily in it. So, how many scenarios could you walk out of that store with? And like always, I'll encourage you to pause the video and try to figure it out on your own. Let's think through it."
Math,"I'll just write the first letters, just to visualize or just so I don't have to write down everything. So, you could have a brown pot, you could have a yellow pot, or you could have a green pot. You difinitely have to pick a pot, so you're going to have one of those. And then for each of these three, there's four possible flowers you could have. You could have a rose with the brown pot, you could have a rose with the yellow pot, you could have a rose with the green pot."
Math,"You could have a tulip with the brown pot, a tulip with the yellow pot, a tulip with the green pot. You could have a sunflower with each of the three pots, or you could have a lily with the brown pot, a lily with the yellow pot, and a lily with a green pot. So, how many scenarios are we talking about? Well, we had three pots, so we have three pots right over here, and we have four possible flowers to put in the pots, and so we see that we have four possible flowers for each of the three pots."
Math,"It's going to be three times four possibilites, or 12. You see them right over here. This is brown with rose, brown with tulip, brown with sunflower, brown with lily. Yellow with rose, yellow with tulip, yellow with sunflower, yellow with lily. So, if we count these, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Twelve possible pot, flower scenarios to walk out of that florist store with.."
Math,"It'll either be a four-cylinder or a six-cylinder engine. And they're literally just going to flip a fair coin to decide whether I get a four-cylinder engine or a six-cylinder engine. Then they're going to pick the color. And there's four different colors that the cars come in. So I'll write color in a neutral color. So you could get a red car. That's not red. Let me do that in actual red color, or close to red."
Math,"You could get a red car, you could get a blue car, you could get a green car, or you could get a white car. And once again, they're going to have the red, blue, green, and white in little slips of paper in a bowl and they're just going to pick one of them out. So all of these are equally likely. So given this, that they're just going to flip a coin to pick the engine, and that all of these, the colors all equally likely, I want to think about the probability of getting a six-cylinder white car."
Math,"So I encourage you to pause the video and think about it on your own. Well, one way to think about this is, well, what are all the equally likely possible outcomes? And then which of those match six-cylinder white car? Well, first, we could think about the engine decision. We're either going to get a four-cylinder engine. So the first decision is the engine. You could view it that way. You're either going to get a four-cylinder engine, or you're going to get a six-cylinder engine."
Math,"Now, if you got a four-cylinder engine, you're either going to get red, blue, green, or white. And if you've got a six-cylinder engine, once again, you're either going to get red, blue-- I think you see where this is going. That's not blue. Red, blue, green, or white. So how many possible outcomes are there? Well, you could just count. You could kind of say, the leaves of this tree diagram-- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight possible outcomes. And that makes sense."
Math,"You have two possible engines times four possible colors. You see that right here-- one group of four, two groups of four. So this outcome right here is a four-cylinder blue car. And this outcome over here is a six-cylinder green car. So there's eight equally possible outcomes. And which outcome matches the one that we, I guess, are hoping for, the white six-cylinder car? Well, that's this one right over here. It's one of eight equally likely events. So we have a 1/8 probability."
Math,"This wasn't the only way that we could have drawn the tree diagram. We could have thought about color as the first row of this tree. So we could have said, look, we're either going to get a-- let me do it down here, so I have a little more space-- we're either going to get a red, a blue-- that's not blue. Changing colors is the hard part. A blue, a green, or a white car. And then for each of those colors, I'm either going to get a four-cylinder or a six-cylinder engine."
Math,"So it's either going to be four or six. This would be another way of drawing a tree diagram to represent all of the outcomes. So what is this outcome right over here? This is a six-cylinder red car. This is a four-cylinder blue car right over here. Which is the one that we care about? White six-cylinder car? That's this outcome right over here. Once again, you see you have eight equally likely outcomes. And that happens because you have four possible colors."
Math,"And for each of those four possible colors, you have two different engine types.."
Math,"Should she just ask her neighbors? Well, she might live in a part of the neighborhood that might unusually benefit from the redistricting plan or might get hurt from the redistricting plan. And so just her neighbors wouldn't be representative of the district as a whole. So just asking her neighbors probably does not make sense. Ask the residents of Whispering Pines Retirement Community. So once again, the first one skews by geography. She's oversampling her neighbors and not the entire district."
Math,"Here, she's oversampling a specific age demographic. So here she is oversampling older residents who might have very different opinions then middle aged or younger residents. So that doesn't make sense either. Ask 200 residents of her district whose names are chosen at random. Well, that seems reasonable. It doesn't seem like there's some chance that you somehow over sampled one direction or another. But it's most likely to give a reasonably representative sample. And this is a pretty large sample size."
Math,"So it's important to say, what is the random process, where she getting these names from? But this actually does seem reasonable. Ask a group of parents at the local playground. Well once again, this is just like asking your neighbors. And it's also sampling a specific demographic. Now, this might be the demographic that cares most about the schools. But she wants to know how the whole district feels about the redistricting plan. And once ago, this is at a local playground."
Math,This isn't at all the playgrounds in the district somehow. So I wouldn't do this one either. Let's do one more of these. Mimi wants to conduct a survey of her 300 classmates to determine which candidate for class president-- Napoleon Dynamite or Blair Waldorf-- is in the lead in the upcoming election.
Math,"Mimi will ask the question, if the election were today which candidate would get your vote? Which of the following methods of surveying her classmates will allow Mimi to make valid conclusions about which candidate is in the lead? So let's see, ask all of the students at Blair's lunch table? That would skew it in Blair's favor, probably. That's not a representative sample. Ask all the members of Napoleon's soccer team? No, same thing."
Math,"They're likely to go Napoleon's way or maybe they don't like Napoleon, maybe they'll go against Napoleon. But either way this seems like a skewed sample. Put the names of all the students in a hat and draw 50 names. Ask those students whose names are drawn. Well this seems like a nice random sample that could be nicely representative of the entire population. Ask all students whose names begin with N or B? Well, this could be perceived as kind of random."
Math,"But notice, N is the same starting letter as Napoleon, B is the same starter letter as Blair. You might say, well, that's fair. You're doing it for each of their letters. But maybe there's like 10 people whose names start with an N and only two people whose names start with a B. Once again, you're not even getting a large sample. And then on top of that, maybe there's some type of people with the same starting letter somehow like each other more. So I would steer clear of this one."
Math,"Ask every student in the class? Well, that would work. There's 300 classmates, that might not be that time consuming. You can't get a better sample than asking everyone in the population. Which of the following methods of surveying our class which will allow Mimi to make a valid conclusion about which candidate in the lead? Well, that's a pretty good conclusion. People might change their mind. So it's not a done deal. You can't get a better sample size then the entire population."
Math,Assign numbers to each student in the class and use a computer program to generate 50 random numbers between 1 and 300. Ask those students whose numbers are selected. Well this is pretty close to put the names of all the student in a hat and draw 50 names. So I would give this one. That seems reasonable as well..
Math,"The lower dot plot shows the times of the same 8 swimmers, but in the final round. Which pieces of information can be gathered from these dot plots? In the semifinal round, we see that these are the 8 times of the 8 swimmers. We see 3 swimmers finished in exactly 53.5 seconds. One swimmer finished in 53.7 seconds right here. And one swimmer right over here finished in 52.7 seconds. And we can think about similar things for each of these dots."
Math,"Now, in the final round, one swimmer here went much, much, much faster. So this is in 52.2 seconds. While this swimmer right over here went slower. We don't know which dot he was up here. But regardless of which dot he was up here, this dot took more time than all of these dots. So his time definitely got worse. And this is at 53.8 seconds. So let's look at the statements and see which of these apply. The swimmers had faster times, on average, in the finals."
Math,"Is this true? Faster times on average in the finals? So if we look at the finals right over here, we could take each of these times, add them up, and then divide by 8, the number of times we have. But let's see if we can get an intuition for where this is, because we're really just comparing these two plots, or these two distributions, we could say. And so let's see, if all the data was these three points and these three points, we could intuit that the mean would be right around there."
Math,"It would be around 53.2 or 53.3 seconds, right around there. And then we have this point and this point, if you just found the mean of that point and that point, so halfway between that point and that point, would get you right around there. So the mean of those two points would bring down the mean a little bit. And once again, I'm not figuring out the exact number. But maybe it would be around 53.2, 53.1, or 53.2 seconds. So that's my intuition for the mean of the final round."
Math,"And now let's think about the mean of the semifinal round. Let's just look at these bottom five dots. If you find their mean, you could intuit it would be maybe someplace around here, pretty close to around 53.3 seconds. And then you have all these other ones that are at 53.5 and 53.3, which will bring the mean even higher. So I think it's fair to say that the mean in the final around and the time is less than the mean up here."
Math,"And you could calculate it yourself, but I'm just trying to look at the distributions and get an intuition here. And at least in this case, it looks pretty clear that the swimmers had faster times, on average, in the finals. It took them less time. One of the swimmers was disqualified from the finals. Well, that's not true. We have 8 swimmers in the semifinal round. And we have 8 swimmers in the final round. So that one's not true."
Math,"The times in the finals vary noticeably more than the times in the semifinals. That does look to be true. We see in the semifinals, a lot of the times were clumped up right around here at 53.3 seconds and 53.5 seconds. The high time isn't as high as this time. The low time isn't as low there. So the final round is definitely-- they vary noticeably more. Individually, the swimmers all swam faster in the finals than they did in the semifinals. Well, that's not true."
Math,"Whoever this was, clearly they were one of these data points up here. This data point took more time than all of these data points. So this represents someone who took more time in the finals than they did in the semifinals. And we got it right.."
Math,"So shape B right over here, so it starts off, it looks like the width is a little bit bigger than the height, I'm just trying to eyeball it, we don't know the exact numbers. And so in order to create a scaled copy, you'd want to scale the width, you'd want to scale this bottom side, and the top side, and all of the sides. You'd want to scale by the same factor. But as we move this slider, it seems like it's only scaling the width, it's not scaling the height."
Math,"So this slider, shape B right over here, the slider for shape B is not creating scale copies of itself, it's only increasing the width, not the height. While shape A, it looks like it is increasing both the width and the height, so that would be a scale copy. So for example, that looks like a scale copy of this, which looks like a scale copy of this, which looks like a scale copy of that, which was our original shape. That is not a scaled copy of this. Let's do another example."
Math,"So once again they say, ""Drag the sliders."" And they say, ""Which slider creates a scale copy ""of the shape?"" All right, let's get shape A. So this does look like we're scaling down, but we're scaling both the width and the height by the same factor, so this shape A slider does look like it's creating scale copies of the shape. B right over here, well now we're only scaling, it looks like we're only scaling the height, but not the width, so this is not creating scale copies of our original shape."
Math,"It's elongating it, it's increasing its height, but not the width.."
Math,"Looks like figure two not only has it been scaled down, it's a smaller version, but it also looks like it has been rotated 180 degrees or you can say it's been flipped upside down. We're asked to identify the side in figure two that corresponds to side EA in figure one. So this is EA in figure one. Pause this video and see if you can identify the side of figure two that corresponds to side EA in figure one. Alright, now let's work through this together."
Math,"Some of you might immediately intuit or be able to spot which side corresponds to EA but I'll do it slightly more methodically in this video just so that we can see maybe all of the corresponding sides and points. So one way to think about it is well, it looks like the longest side in figure one is side BC."
Math,"So this is the longest side in figure one and then the longest side in figure two is HL so it looks like BC corresponds to HL and then touching on that longest side, that longest side has two right angles. It forms two right angles with the sides next to it. So you have these two right angles right over here and then of those two right angles, you have the shorter side connected to the longest side and so that is BA over here and so that would correspond to LK right over here."
Math,"That is the shorter side connected to the long side that forms a right angle and then if we just keep following that side of the shape, we then go to side AE which would correspond now to and this is answering our question to side KJ."
Math,"So the side in figure two that corresponds to EA in figure one, that is going to be KJ or we could say side JK and if someone wanted to say what points correspond to which point, well, you can see that BA corresponds to LK and BC corresponds to LH so we would know for example that this point B right over here, point B would correspond to point L in figure two right over here and we could use a similar logic for the other points."
Math,"So we've answered the questions, the question, but the real thing is to see well, which sides or points have similar features on a relative basis? So I said what is the longest side? What is the longest side? Where do we see right angles? And sometimes your brain might just immediately be able to spot out the shape. If you were to rotate this one all the way around, it would jump out at you a little bit faster that JK and AE are corresponding sides.."
Math,"One way is to say, ""Well, let's see what the scaling factor would be."" We could look at the side lengths. This side right over here has length three on Figure A. This side length right over here has length one, two, three, four, five. This side length has length five as well. This has length five. This length, we could figure it out with the Pythagorean Theorem, but I won't even look at that one just yet. But let's look at corresponding sides. To go from this side."
Math,"If we scale up, the corresponding side to that would be this side right over here. What is its length? Well, its length, when you scale it up, looks like five. So to go from three to five you would have to multiply by 5/3. But let's look at this side now. It's five in Figure A. What length is it in Figure B? Well, it is one, two, three, four, five."
Math,"It's still five, so to go from five to five, you have to multiply it by one, and so you have a different scaling factor for corresponding, or what could have been corresponding sides. This side right over here, you're scaling up by 5/3, while this bottom side, this base right here, you're not scaling at all. So these actually are not scaled versions of each other. Let's do another example. In this example, is Figure B a scaled version of Figure A? Pause the video and see if you can figure it out."
Math,"All right, well we're gonna do the same exercise, and here they've given us the measures of the different sides. This side has length two. This side has length the corresponding side, or what could be the corresponding side has length six. To go from two to six, you have to multiply by three. If we look at these two potentially corresponding sides, that side and that side, once again, to go from four to twelve, you would multiply by three, so that is looking good as well."
Math,"Now to go from this side down here, this has length six. The potentially corresponding side right over here has the length 14. Well here we're not multiplying by three. If these were scaled If Figure B was a scaled-up version of Figure A, we would multiply by three, but six times three is not 14, it's 18, so these actually are not Figure B is not a scaled version of Figure A. Let's do one more example. Once again, pause this video and see if Figure B is a scaled version of Figure A."
Math,"We're gonna do the same exercise. Let's look at potentially corresponding sides. That side to that side, to go from four to 12, we would multiply by three, and then we could look at this side and this side, to go from four to 12, once again you multiply by three, so that's looking good so far. We could look at this side and this side, potentially corresponding sides. Once again, we're going from four to 12, multiplying by three. Looks good so far. And then we could look at this side and this side."
Math,"2.2 to 6.6, once again multiplying by three. Looking really good. And then we only have one last one to check. 2.2 to 6.6, once again multiplying by three, so all of the side lengths have been scaled up by three, so we can feel pretty good that Figure B is indeed a scaled-up representation of Figure A.."
Math,"For example, this side right over here would correspond to this side right over here on figure b. And over here, it had length two and over here it has length one, two three, four, five, six. So, it look like that side has been scaled up by a factor of three. If figure b truly is a scaled copy, then every side should be scaled up by a factor of three. We could verify that. We don't have to do it with every side. We're being told that these are scaled copies but we can see that this is the case."
Math,"For example, this side right over here, corresponds to this base right over here. This has length three. So, if we're scaling up by a factor of three, we should multiply that by three and this should be of length nine. Let's see if that's the case. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. So, you can see, we can feel pretty good that figure b is a scaled copy of figure a and that scaling factor is three.."
Math,"AD has length 16 units in our original quadrilateral. What could be the length of the side that corresponds with AD on the scaled copy of the quadrilateral? So it's a scale factor less than one. So we're gonna get something that is less than 16 for that side. And the rest of it will all be scaled by the same factor. So the resulting quadrilateral might look something, might look something like this. This is just my hand-drawn version."
Math,"So the key realization is is if our scale factor is less than one, this thing right over here is going to be less than 16 units. So let's look at the choices. And it says choose three answers. So pause the video. Which of these would match if we're scaling by a factor of less than one? Well, we just have to see which of these are less than 16 units. This is less than 16. This is less than 16. This is less than 16. And those are the only three that are less than 16."
Math,"32 units, this would be a scale factor of two. 64 units, this would be a scale factor of four, clearly a scale factor that is not less than one.."
Math,"All right, so X is the length of this side right over here on Figure A, and the corresponding side on Figure B has length five. And so, one way to think about it is the ratio between X and five should be one to two and a half because that's the scale that goes from Figure A to Figure B. Figure A to Figure B. So, the ratio, let me write this out. The ratio between X and five, so the ratio of X to five, this should be an equivalent ratio as one, one to two and a half."
Math,"One to two and a half, and that one is hard to read, let me make it a deeper blue, there you go. All right, so let's just think about how to do this. To go from from two and a half to five, to go that way, you would multiply be two, so to go from one to X, you would also multiple by two. So, the value of X is equal to two. If these are scaled up, you multiple this by two and a half, you get to five, so the scale factor is one to two and a half. Let's do another example."
Math,"We're told Figure A is a scale image of Figure B, and we see them both right over here, and once again, we gotta figure out what X is going to be. And they don't give us the scale factor, but we can figure out the scale factor. How do we do that? Well, we can see, when you go from, this side right over here corresponds to this side. It's the shorter side that forms a right angle with the base, this is the longer side that forms a right angle with the base, and so, you could set up some ratios."
Math,"You can say, look, the ratio of three to four, you can say the ratio of three to four, we need that blue color, the ratio of three to four is going to be the same thing as the ratio of X to 7.2. The ratio of X to 7.2, and so how do we figure out what X is going to be? Well, how do you go from four to 7.2? What do you have to multiply by? You might wanna get out a calculator or you might be able to do this in your head."
Math,"Four 72 is two times 36, which is two times 18, so four times 18 would be 72 or four times 1.8 would be 7.2, and if you don't feel good about that mental arithmetic, you could just do the division. Four goes into seven one time, one times four is four, subtract, you get a three, you're gonna have your decimal right over there, bring down the two, 32, four goes into 32 eight times, eight times four is 32, and we're done."
Math,"So, to go from four to 7.2, you have to multiply by 1.8 and so, to go from three to X, you also have to multiply by 1.8. And so, X is three times 1.8, what is that going to be? Well, three times 18 is, what? 30, it's 54, so this is going to be 5.4. Let me verify that or show you that. 18 or 1.8 times three, three times eight is 24, three times one is three, plus two is five, one number behind the decimal point, 5.4 and we're done.."
Math,"In this case of a house. And so what we can do is set-up a little bit of a table here, so let's put the drawing on the left, so this is the blue print drawing. And then this is the real world. Real world on the right. And the unit that we're using, the units that we're using in our drawing are centimeters. So we have centimeters over here. And then the real world, we're thinking in terms of meters. And so let me make a little bit of a table."
Math,"And so we see that 10 centimeters on the drawing corresponds to 2 meters in the real world. So 10 centimeters in the drawing, corresponds to 2 meters in the real world. Then they ask us what number of actual meters are represented by 18 centimeters on the blue print? So 18 centimeters on the blue print would correspond to what in the real world? Well there's several ways to approach it. One way to think about it is, look to go from 10 to 18, we are going to multiply by 1.8."
Math,"So to go from what 10 centimeters represents in the real world to what 18 centimeters represents in the real world, you would similarly multiply by 1.8. So times 1.8, which would give us 3.6. 3.6 what? 3.6 meters in the real world. So 3.6 meters in the real world would be what 18 centimeters on the blue print represents. Let's do another example. Jaylynn draws a hen with a scale of 2 units on her graph paper represents 6 meters, 6 centimeters in the real world. The hen is 16 units tall in the drawing."
Math,"What is the height in centimeters of the actual hen? So once again, pause this video and see if you can figure that out. Alright, so let's just set-up our tables again. So for our table, so we have our drawing, and then we have the real, real world. And in our drawing, it's just these little units on our graph paper, so I'll call it just that, units. And the real world, we're thinking in terms of centimeters, centimeters."
Math,"And so let me set-up a little bit of a table here, and so we know, and we see that right over here from this scale. We can see two units represent 6 centimeters in the real world. So two units in our drawing represent six centimeters in the real world, and then they say the hen is 16 units tall in the drawing. So it's 16 units tall in the drawing."
Math,"What would that represent in the real world which would be the actual height of the hen? If two units represent six centimeters, and now we have eight times as many units, well that's gonna represent eight times as many centimeters. So six times eight is 48 centimeters. So what is the height in centimeters of the actual hen? 48 centimeters, 48 and we're done.."
Math,"This is the scale plan, and then we could figure out these dimensions in the real world by looking at the scale factor right over here. It's an 80 to 1 scale floor plan. And we can assume that the house is much bigger than the floor plan. So the 80, for every 80 units in the house, that represents 1 unit on the floor plan. So if we had 80 meters in the house, that would be represented as 1 meter on the floor plan."
Math,"If we had 80 centimeters in the house, that would be represented by 1 centimeter in the floor plan. And it goes the other way around. 1 centimeter on the floor plan would represent 80 centimeters in the house. And it's always important to do-- if this confuses you, just always do a reality check that the house should be bigger than the floor plan. So if the floor plan for this dimension of our living room is 4 centimeters, the actual house will be 80 times that."
Math,"And 80 times 4 is 320-- let me do that in a blue color-- is equal to 320 centimeters. And we can do the same thing for the length of the living room. So 80 times 5 centimeters is going to get us to-- is going to be-- 80 times 5 is 400 centimeters. So we could figure out the area of this room in centimeters, if we like, and I guess, why not? It might be easier to convert it to meters later. So let's see, 400 centimeters times 320 centimeters. Let me write this down. 400 times 320. Let's think about it."
Math,"4 times 32 is going to be 120, plus 8, 128. And I have 1, 2, 3 zeroes. 1, 2, 3. So it's going to be 128,000 centimeters squared. Now that's a lot of square centimeters. What would we do if we wanted to convert it into meters? Well, we just have to figure out how many square centimeters are there in a square meter. So let's think about it this way. A meter is equal to-- 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters. So a square meter, so that's right over there."
Math,"1 meter squared would be 1 meter by 1 meter, which is the same thing as 100 centimeters by 100 centimeters. And so if you were to calculate this area in centimeters, 100 times 100 is 10,000, is equal to 10,000 centimeters squared. So you have 10,000 square centimeters for every square meter. And so, if you want to convert 128,000 centimeters squared to meters squared, you would divide by 10,000. So dividing that by 10,000 would give us 12.8 square meters."
Math,"Now, another way you could've done it, and maybe this would have been easier, is to convert it up here. Instead of saying 400 centimeters times 320 centimeters, you would say, well, 400 centimeters, that's going to be 4 meters. And 320 centimeters, well, that's 3.2 meters. And you would say, OK, 4 times 3.2, that is 12.8 square meters. But either way, the area of the living room in the real world in meters squared, or square meters, is 12.8.."
Math,"Draw the processor such that one unit on the grid below represents one half of a millimeter. All right, so let's just think about these two worlds. You have the drawing, and you have the chip in the real world. The drawing, we're thinking in terms of these units here on this graph paper, so units. And the chip, we're thinking in terms of millimeters. And so we can set up a table here. And they tell us draw it such that one unit represents half a millimeter."
Math,"So one unit would represent one half of a millimeter. They tell us that the processor is nine millimeters on each side. So that is how many times as many millimeters? Well, to go from one half to nine, you have to multiply by 18. So that's going to be 18 times as many units as well. So if I want to do a scale drawing right over here, it's going to be a square. It's a square chip. And since the scale is one unit, it represents half a millimeter."
Math,"18 units would represent nine millimeters, and so I would want to do 18 units on a side. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. So that would be the left side of the chip. Let me just see if I can draw a straight line there, just like that. And then it would also be 18 wide, 18 units wide, representing nine millimeters in the real world. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18."
Math,"This is making my eyes hurt. All right, so just like that, and then I could draw the other parts of it. It would be like that, and then I would just go straight down like that. And there you have it, I have drawn a scale drawing of our processor, and we are all done.."
Math,"Create a scale drawing of the block using a scale factor of 0.1. So the first thing we could think about, they give us the area of the block. And it's a square block. So it has the same length and width. So we could use that information to figure out the length and width of that block. So if it's a square, so let's imagine a square block right over here. And that this is, I guess we could call that the length. And then this is also going to be the length. It's going to be the same dimensions."
Math,"We know that the area is just going to be the length times the length is going to be equal to 8,100. Or we could say that our length squared is going to be equal to 8,100. So what times itself is equal to 8,100? Well, the 81 might jump out at you. We know that 9 times 9 is equal to 81. But then we have these two zeroes right over here. But if we give each of these nines a zero, then we'll end up with two zeros in the product. So 90 times 90 is equal to 8,100."
Math,"So now we know the dimensions of this square block. It's a 90 meter by 90 meter square block. It's my best attempt to draw a square block. Now that's the actual square block. Here let me draw it a little bit more like a square. My first drawing looked a little bit too much like a rhombus. So here you go. A little bit better attempt at a square. Now we want to create at a scale drawing of the block using a scale factor of 0.1. So the actual block, once again, is 90 meters by 90 meters."
Math,"But in our scale drawing, and I'll do this in this purple color, we essentially want each of the dimensions to be 1/10 of their original dimensions. So we could take the scale factor and multiply it by each of these dimensions right over here. So 90 times 0.1, well that's just going to be 9. This right over here is a 1/10. A 1/10 of 90 meters is going to be 9 meters. And so this, when we draw the scale drawing at the scale that Cole intends to draw it at, we would draw 9 meters by 9 meters."
Math,"And so let's go to the actual tool and draw a 9 meter by 9 meter square, or a 9 by 9 square. We can assume that the units here are in terms of meters. So let's see. I could draw in that dimension. OK, a 9 there. Let me use my mouse instead of my pen tool. It'll be easier. And then let me make this 9, this side 9, and then I could make this side 9. And then we are all set. It's a square. We see we have four right angles. And now we can check our answer. And we got it right.."
Math,"Since we're talking about area, I like to deal with rectangles since it's easy to think about areas of rectangles. And so, let's see, Polygon Q is a scaled copy of Polygon P. So let's start with Polygon P. And I will do this in red. So Polygon P, let's just say, I'm just gonna create an arbitrary polygon. So let's say that this is, and I'm gonna scale it by one half so I'm gonna make its sides have nice even numbers."
Math,"So let's say this side right over here is four and this side right over here is equal to eight, this is Polygon P right over here, it's a quadrilateral, it's in fact a rectangle and its area is just going to be four times eight which is 32. Now let's create Polygon Q, and remember, Polygon Q is a scaled copy of P using a scale factor of one half. So we're gonna scale it by one half."
Math,"So instead of this side being four, it's going to be two and instead of this side over here being eight, the corresponding side in the scaled version is going to be four. So there you go, we've scaled it by one half, and now what is our area going to be? Well our area, and this Polygon Q, and so our area is going to be two times four which is equal to eight."
Math,"So notice that Polygon Q's area is one fourth of Polygon P's area and that makes sense because when you scale the dimensions of the Polygon by one half, the area is going to change by the square of that. One half squared is one fourth and so the area has been changed by a factor of one fourth or another way to answer this question, Polygon Q's area is what fraction of Polygon P's area? Well it's going to be one fourth of Polygon P's area."
Math,"And the big takeaway here is if you scale something, if you scale the sides of a figure by one half each, then the area is going to be the square of that and so one half squared is one over four. If it was scaled by one third, then the area would be scaled, or the area would be one ninth. If it was scaled by a factor of two, then our area would have grown by a factor of four. Let's do another example. Here we're told, Rectangle N has an area of five square units. Let me do this in a different color."
Math,"So Rectangle N has an area of five square units. James drew a scaled version of Rectangle N and labeled it Rectangle P. So they have that right over here. This is a scaled version of Rectangle N. What scale factor did James use to go from Rectangle N to Rectangle P? So let's think about it. They gave us Rectangle P right over here, and let's think about its dimensions."
Math,"This height is one, two, three, four, five, it's five high, and it is, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine wide, and so its area is equal to 45. Now, Rectangle N had an area of five square units. So our area, let me write this down, so N area to P area, N area to P area, we are multiplying by a factor of nine."
Math,"If we're going from an area of five square units to 45 square units, you notice N area is five, N's area is five square units, P's area, we just figured out is 45 square units, and so we have it growing by a factor of nine. Now what would be the scale factor if our area grew by a factor of nine? Well we just talked about the idea that area will grow, the factor with which area grows is the square of the scale factor."
Math,"So one way to think about it is scale factor, scale factor squared is going to be equal to nine, or another way to think about it, our scale factor is going to be equal to three to go from N to P. Now let's verify that we answered their question but I just want us to feel good about it. Let's draw a rectangle that is scaled down from P by a factor of three. So a rectangle if we were to scale it up by a factor of three, we get rectangle P. So its bottom would have length three instead of nine."
Math,"So it'd be like this. So that would be three, and its height instead of being five, it would be five thirds. Five thirds is one and two thirds, so it'd go about that high, it would look something like that. It would be five thirds. And so our Rectangle N would look like this, and what is its area? Well five thirds times three is indeed five square units. So notice, when we have the area growing by a factor of nine, the scale factor of the size to go from five thirds to five, you multiply by three."
Math,"To go from three to nine, you multiply by three.."
Math,"What is the length of the actual dining room in feet? So there's a couple of really interesting things going on They give us the dimensions of the blueprint in inches. We want the actual length in feet. And then they tell us that the area of the actual dining room is 1,600 times larger. So they're not saying that the scale of the blueprint is at 1/1600. It's going to be something less than that, and let's think about what that scale is going to be. Let's just think about some different scales."
Math,"Let's say that this is my blueprint, and this is the actual reality of the dining room that we're thinking about. And my blueprint is let's just say 1 by 1, just for the sake of argument. Now, if this was a 1 by 1 square and we increased the dimensions by a factor of 2, so it's a 2 by 2 square, what's the area going to be? Well, this area is going to be 4. This area is 1, this area is 4. So you notice that if we increase by a factor of 2, it increase our area by a factor of 4."
Math,"Or another way of saying, if we increase each of our dimensions by a factor of 2, we're going to increase our area by a factor of 4. If instead we increased each of our dimensions by a factor of 3, this would be a 3 by 3 square, and we would increase our area by a factor of 9. So notice, whatever factor we're increasing the area by, it's going to be the factor that we're increasing the dimensions by squared. So let's just think about it that way."
Math,"So they're telling us that we're increasing the area by 1,600 times. Actually, let me just clean this thing up a little bit. So one way we could imagine it, if our drawing did have an area of 1, which we can't assume, but we could for the sake of just figuring out what the scale of the drawing is. Let me clear all of this here."
Math,"So the area of the actual dining room is 1,600 times larger, and so if the drawing had an area of 1, then the area of the actual dining room would be 1,600 So what would I have to multiply each of the dimensions by to get an area factor of 1,600? Well, if I multiply this dimension by 40 and this dimension by 40, we see 40 times 40 is 1,600. You might say, hey, Sal, how did you figure out 40? Well, the 16 is a big clue."
Math,"We know that 4 times 4 is equal to 16, and so if you gave a 0 to each of these 4's, if you made it 40 times 40, then that is going to be 1,600. So this information right over here tells us that the scale factor of the lengths is 40. That would result in an scale factor for the area of 1,600. So that's a good starting point. Now let's go to the actual dining room on the blueprint. So the actual dining room on the blueprint doesn't have these dimensions. We just used that to figure out the scaling factor."
Math,"The actual dining room on the blueprint has a length of 3 inches. So maybe it looks something like this. They don't give us any of the other dimensions, so we can even imagine a 3 inch by 2 inch, 1 inch, whatever we want. We could even imagine a 3 inch by 3 inch square. They only care about the length. Now let's multiply both of these by a factor of 40. And we only care about the length here."
Math,"They actually say what's the length of the actual dining So let's multiply it, and obviously, this is not drawn to scale. Let's multiply this times a factor of 40. So 3 times 40 is 120, and this, of course, is what we're referring to as the length. Now, you might be tempted to say OK, we're done. This will be 120. But remember, this is 120 inches. So what is 120 inches in terms of feet? Well, 1 foot is equal to 12 inches."
Math,"If we were to multiply both of these times 10, we know that 10 feet is equal to 120 inches. Or another way you could have thought about it, you have 120 inches divided by 12 inches per foot is going to give you 10. So 120 divided by-- 120 inches-- let me write it this way. 120 inches divided by 12 inches per foot is going to give you 10 feet. So that's the actual length of the dining room in feet.."
Math,"So the first thing when people kind of discovered the circle, and you just have a look at the moon to see a circle, but the first time they said well, what are the properties of any circle? So the first one they might want to say is well, a circle is all of the points that are equal distant from the center of the circle. All of these points along the edge are equal distant from that center right there."
Math,"So one of the first things someone might want to ask is what is that distance, that equal distance that everything is from the center? Right there. We call that the radius of the circle. It's just the distance from the center out to the edge. If that radius is 3 centimeters, then this radius is going to be 3 centimeters. And this radius is going to be 3 centimeters. It's never going to change. By definition, a circle is all of the points that are equal distant from the center point."
Math,"And that distance is the radius. Now the next most interesting thing about that, people might say well, how fat is the circle? How wide is it along its widest point? Or if you just want to cut it along its widest point, what is that distance right there? And it doesn't have to be just right there, I could have just as easily cut it along its widest point right there. I just wouldn't be cutting it like some place like that because that wouldn't be along its widest point."
Math,"There's multiple places where I could cut it along its widest point. Well, we just saw the radius and we see that widest point goes through the center and just keeps going. So it's essentially two radii. You got one radius there and then you have another radius over there. We call this distance along the widest point of the circle, the diameter. So that is the diameter of the circle. It has a very easy relationship with the radius. The diameter is equal to two times the radius."
Math,"Now, the next most interesting thing that you might be wondering about a circle is how far is it around the circle? So if you were to get your tape measure out and you were to measure around the circle like that, what's that distance? We call that word the circumference of the circle. Now, we know how the diameter and the radius relates, but how does the circumference relate to, say, the diameter. And if you're not really used to the diameter, it's very easy to figure out how it relates to the radius."
Math,"Well, many thousands of years ago, people took their tape measures out and they keep measuring circumferences and radiuses. And let's say when their tape measures weren't so good, let's say they measured the circumference of the circle and they would get well, it looks like it's about 3. And then they measure the radius of the circle right here or the diameter of that circle, and they'd say oh, the diameter looks like it's about 1. So they would say -- let me write this down."
Math,"So we're worried about the ratio -- let me write it like this. The ratio of the circumference to the diameter. So let's say that somebody had some circle over here -- let's say they had this circle, and the first time with not that good of a tape measure, they measured around the circle and they said hey, it's roughly equal to 3 meters when I go around it. And when I measure the diameter of the circle, it's roughly equal to 1. OK, that's interesting."
Math,"Maybe the ratio of the circumference of the diameter's 3. So maybe the circumference is always three times the diameter. Well that was just for this circle, but let's say they measured some other circle here. It's like this -- I drew it smaller. Let's say that on this circle they measured around it and they found out that the circumference is 6 centimeters, roughly -- we have a bad tape measure right then. Then they find out that the diameter is roughly 2 centimeters."
Math,"And once again, the ratio of the circumference of the diameter was roughly 3. OK, this is a neat property of circles. Maybe the ratio of the circumference to the diameters always fixed for any circle. So they said let me study this further. So they got better tape measures. When they got better tape measures, they measured hey, my diameter's definitely 1. They say my diameter's definitely 1, but when I measure my circumference a little bit, I realize it's closer to 3.1."
Math,"And the same thing with this over here. They notice that this ratio is closer to 3.1. Then they kept measuring it better and better and better, and then they realized that they were getting this number, they just kept measuring it better and better and they were getting this number 3.14159. And they just kept adding digits and it would never repeat. It was a strange fascinating metaphysical number that kept showing up."
Math,"So since this number was so fundamental to our universe, because the circle is so fundamental to our universe, and it just showed up for every circle. The ratio of the circumference of the diameter was this kind of magical number, they gave it a name. They called it pi, or you could just give it the Latin or the Greek letter pi -- just like that. That represents this number which is arguably the most fascinating number in our universe."
Math,"It first shows up as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, but you're going to learn as you go through your mathematical journey, that it shows up everywhere. It's one of these fundamental things about the universe that just makes you think that there's some order to it."
Math,"But anyway, how can we use this in I guess our basic mathematics? So we know, or I'm telling you, that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter -- when I say the ratio, literally I'm just saying if you divide the circumference by the diameter, you're going to get pi. Pi is just this number. I could write 3.14159 and just keep going on and on and on, but that would be a waste of space and it would just be hard to deal with, so people just write this Greek letter pi there."
Math,"So, how can we relate this? We can multiply both sides of this by the diameter and we could say that the circumference is equal to pi times the diameter. Or since the diameter is equal to 2 times the radius, we could say that the circumference is equal to pi times 2 times the radius. Or the form that you're most likely to see it, it's equal to 2 pi r. So let's see if we can apply that to some problems."
Math,"So let's say I have a circle just like that, and I were to tell you it has a radius -- it's radius right there is 3. So, 3 -- let me write this down -- so the radius is equal to 3. Maybe it's 3 meters -- put some units in there. What is the circumference of the circle? The circumference is equal to 2 times 5 times the radius. So it's going to be equal to 2 times pi times the radius, times 3 meters, which is equal to 6 meters times pi or 6 pi meters. 6 pi meters. Now I could multiply this out."
Math,"Remember pi is just a number. Pi is 3.14159 going on and on and on. So if I multiply 6 times that, maybe I'll get 18 point something something something. If you have your calculator you might want to do it, but for simplicity people just tend to leave our numbers in terms of pi. Now I don't know what this is if you multiply 6 times 3.14159, I don't know if you get something close to 19 or 18, maybe it's approximately 18 point something something something. I don't have my calculator in front of me."
Math,"But instead of writing that number, you just write 6 pi there. Actually, I think it wouldn't quite cross the threshold to 19 yet. Now, let's ask another question. What is the diameter of the circle? Well if this radius is 3, the diameter is just twice that. So it's just going to be 3 times 2 or 3 plus 3, which is equal to 6 meters. So the circumference is 6 pi meters, the diameter is 6 meters, the radius is 3 meters. Now let's go the other way. Let's say I have another circle."
Math,"Let's say I have another circle here. And I were to tell you that its circumference is equal to 10 meters -- that's the circumference of the circle. If you were to put a tape measure to go around it and someone were to ask you what is the diameter of the circle? Well, we know that the diameter times pi, we know that pi times the diameter is equal to the circumference; is equal to 10 meters. So to solve for this we would just divide both sides of this equation by pi."
Math,"The diameter would equal 10 meters over pi or 10 over pi meters. And that is just a number. If you have your calculator, you could actually divide 10 divided by 3.14159, you're going to get 3 point something something something meters. I can't do it in my head. But this is just a number. But for simplicity we often just leave it that way. Now what is the radius? Well, the radius is equal to 1/2 the diameter. So this whole distance right here is 10 over pi meters."
Math,"If we just 1/2 of that, if we just want the radius, we just multiply it times 1/2. So you have 1/2 times 10 over pi, which is equal to 1/2 times 10, or you just divide the numerator and the denominator by 2. You get 5 there, so you get 5 over pi. So the radius over here is 5 over pi. Nothing super fancy about this. I think the thing that confuses people the most is to just realize that pi is a number. Pi is just 3.14159 and it just keeps going on and on and on."
Math,"There's actually thousands of books written about pi, so it's not like -- I don't know if there's thousands, I'm exaggerating, but you could write books about this number. But it's just a number. It's a very special number, and if you wanted to write it in a way that you're used to writing numbers, you could literally just multiply this out. But most the time people just realize they like leaving things in terms of pi. Anyway, I'll leave you there. In the next video we'll figure out the area of a circle.."
Math,"So that is my circle. I'm going to label the center over here. I'll do the center. I'll call it c. So that is my center. And I'll draw an arrow there. That is the center of the circle. And actually, the circle itself is the set of all points that are a fixed distance away from that center. And that fixed distance away that they're all from that center, that is the radius. So let me draw the radius. So this distance right over here is the radius. That is the radius."
Math,"And that's going to be the same as this distance, which is the same as that distance. I can draw multiple radii. All of these are radii, the distance between the center and any point on the circle. Now, a diameter just goes straight across the circle, going through the center. From one side of the circle to the other side, I'm going through the center. It's essentially two radii put together. So for example, this would be a diameter."
Math,"You have one radii, than another radii, all one line, going from one side of the circle to the other, going through the center. So that is a diameter. And I could have drawn it other ways. I could've drawn it like this. That would be another diameter. But they're going to have the exact same length. And finally, we have to think about the circumference. And the circumference is really just how far you have to go to go around the circle."
Math,"Or if you put a string on this circle, how long will that string have to be? So what I'm tracing out in blue right now, the length of what I'm tracing out, is the circumference. So right over here, that is the circumference. And we're done.."
Math,"And I encourage you to pause the video, and see if you can figure it out on your own. Let's just draw the circle to help visualize it. I'll just do a hand-drawn circle, clearly not a perfect circle right over here. We know that if its radius is of length r, that the circumference is going to be two pi times r. So, I could write the circumference is equal to two pi times r. In fact, the number pi, the standard definition for it, is just the ratio between the circumference and the diameter of a circle."
Math,"Now, why is that? Well, if the diameter here is two r, right? We have r and then have another r. We see that the circumference is pi times two r, or we can say that the ratio between the circumference and the diameter, which is the ratio between c and two r, that's just going to be pi. Anyway, I've gone on longer than I need to just to solve this problem. We can go to this original formula here, saying the circumference is two pi times r, and we can just substitute in 49 pi for the circumference."
Math,"So, we could say 49 pi is going to be equal to two pi times the radius. Now, let's see, we can divide both sides by two pi to solve for r. So, dividing both sides by two pi. On the right-hand side, the two pis cancel out. On the left-hand side, pi divided by pi cancels out. 49 divided by two is 24.5. So, if the circumference is 49 pi whatever units, then the radius is going to be 24.5 of those units. Let's do one more of these."
Math,"Let's say that we have a circle whose circumference, I'll just say C, is equal to 1600 pi. My question is what is the diameter? The diameter of the circle is equal to what? Just as we said that the circumference could be written as two pi r or as pi times two r, two r is just the diameter. So, we could say that the circumference is equal to pi times the diameter. Once again, that comes out of that traditional definition of pi as the ratio between the circumference and the diameter."
Math,"You could say that the ratio between the circumference and the diameter is equal to pi. Circles are this very fundamental thing in the universe, and you take the ratio of the circumference and the diameter, you get this magical and mystical number that we see that keeps popping up in mathematics. Anyway, back to the problem. If we say the circumference is 1600 pi, and this is equal to pi times the diameter, we can just divide both sides by pi to get the diameter, which is going to be 1600."
Math,"The circumference is 1600 pi units, whatever units those are, maybe meters. Then, the diameter is just going to be 1600 of those units, or in this case, maybe meters. And we're all done.."
Math,"And first, think about if you could figure out the area for this particular circle, and then let's see if we can come up with a formula for given any circumference, can we figure out the area and vice versa. Alright now let's work through this together. The key here is to realize that from circumference you can figure out radius and then from radius you can figure out area. So we know that circumference, which is six pi, so we know six pi is equal to two pi times r, radius."
Math,"And so what is the radius going to be? So the radius, we're talking about that distance, well we can divide both sides by two pi, so let's do that. If we divide both sides by two pi, to solve for r, what are we left with? Well we have an r on the right hand side, we have r is equal to pi divided by pi, that's just one. Six divided by two is three. So we get that our radius, right over here, is equal to three units. And then we can use the fact that are is equal to pi, r squared, to figure out the area."
Math,"This is going to be equal to pi times three squared. Oh and you have to write parenthesis there. Pi, times three, squared, which is of course going to be equal to nine pi. So for this particular example, when the circumference is six pi units, we're able to figure out that the area, this is actually going to be nine pi square units, or I could write units squared. Cause we're squaring the radius. The radius is three units, so you square that, you get the units squared."
Math,"Now let's see if we can come up with a general formula. So we know that circumference is equal to two pi r. And we know that area is equal to pi r squared. Can we come up with an expression or a formula that relates directly between circumference and area? And I'll give you a hint, solve for, you could solve for r right over here, and substitute back into this equation, or vice versa. Pause the video, see if you can do that. Alright, so let's do it over here. Let's solve for r."
Math,"If we divide both sides by two pi, do it in another color, so if we divide both sides by two pi, and this is exactly what we did up here, what are we left with? We're left with on the right hand side, r is equal to c the circumference divided by two pi, the radius is equal to the circumference over two pi. And so when we're figuring out the area, area, remember, is equal to pi times our radius squared. But we know that our radius could be written as circumference divided by two pi."
Math,"So instead of radius I'll write circumference over two pi. Remember, we want to relate between area and circumference. And so what is this going to be equal to? We get area is equal to pi times circumference squared, over two pi squared is four pi squared. Now let's see, we have a pi, if we multiplied this out, we'd have a pi in the numerator and a pi in the denominator, or two pi's in the denominator being multiplied. So pi divided by pi squared, is just one over pi, and so there you have it."
Math,"Area is equal to circumference squared divided by four pi. Let me write that down. So this is a neat, you don't tend to learn this formula, but it's cool that we were able to derive it. Area is equal to circumference squared over four pi. And we can go the other way around. Given an area, how do we figure out circumference? Well you could just put the numbers in here, or you could just solve for c. Let's multiply both sides by four pi."
Math,"Let's multiply both sides by four pi, and if we do that, what do we get? We would get four pi times the area is equal to our circumference squared and then to solve for the circumference we just take the square root of both sides. So you would get the square root of four pi times the area is equal to r circumference. And you could simplify this a little bit if you wanted. You could take the four out of the radical, but this is pretty neat, how you can relate circumference and area.."
Math,"And they tell us that the diameter of each wafer is 16 millimeters. If I draw a line across the circle that goes through the center, the length of that line all the way across the circle through the center is 16 millimeters. So let me write that. So the diameter here is 16 millimeters. And they want us to figure out the area of the surface of this candy, or essentially, the area of this circle."
Math,"And so when we think about area, we know that the area of a circle is equal to pi times the radius of the circle squared. And you say, well, they gave us the diameter. What is the radius? Well, you might remember the radius is 1/2 of the diameter. It's the distance from the center of the circle to the outside, to the boundary of the circle. So it would be this distance right over here, which is exactly 1/2 of the diameter, so it would be 8 millimeters."
Math,"So where we see the radius, we could put 8 millimeters. So the area is going to be equal to pi times 8 millimeters squared, which would be 64 square millimeters. And typically, this is written with pi after the 64. So you might often see it as this is equal to 64 pi millimeters squared. Now this is the answer, 64 pi millimeters squared. But sometimes, it's not so satisfying to just leave it as pi. You might say, well, I want to get a estimate of what number this is close to."
Math,"I want a decimal representation of this. And so, we could start to use approximate values of pi. So the most rough approximate value that tends to be used is saying that pi, a very rough approximation, is equal to 3.14. So in that case, we could say that this is going to be equal to 64 times 3.14 millimeters squared. And we can get our calculator to figure out what this will be in decimal form. So we have 64 times 3.14, gives us 200.96."
Math,"So we could say that the area is approximately equal to 200.96 square millimeters. Now if we want to get a more accurate representation of this-- pi actually just keeps going on and on and on forever-- we could use the calculator's internal representation of pi, in which case, we'll say 64 times, and then we have to look for the pi in the calculator. It's up here in this yellow, so I'll do this little second function. Get the pi there. Every calculator will be a little different. But 64 times pi."
Math,"And now we're going to use the calculator's internal approximation of pi, which is going to be more precise than what I had in the last one. And you get 201-- so let me put it over here so I can write it down-- so more precise is 201. And I'll round to the nearest hundreds, so you get 201.06. So more precise is 201.06 square millimeters. So this is closer to the actual answer, because a calculator's representation is more precise than this very rough approximation of what pi is.."
Math,"We know that the area of a circle is equal to pi times our radius squared. So, if we think about the entire circle, what is the area going to be? Well, they tell us what our radius is. Our radius is equal to two, so the area, if we're talking about the whole circle, it would be equal to pi times two squared. Pi times two squared. Two squared is of course two times two, which is equal to four, so our area is going to be equal to four times pi."
Math,"Now, I wouldn't put four pi here, because that would be the entire circle. They want the area of just the semicircle, of just this region right over here. Well, the semicircle is half of the circle, so if I want the area of the semicircle, this is gonna be half this. So instead of four pi, it is going to be two pi square units. That's the area of the semicircle. Let's do another example."
Math,"So here, instead of area, we're asked to find the arc length of the partial circle, and that's we have here in this bluish color right over here, find this arc length. And you can see this is going three fourths of the way around the circle, so this arc length is going to be three fourths of the circumference. So what is the circumference? Well, we know the circumference is equal to two pi times the radius. They tell us what the radius is."
Math,"It's equal to four, so our circumference is equal to two pi times four. Let's see, we can just change the order in which we multiply so it's two times four times pi. This is going to be equal to eight pi. This is going to be equal to eight pi. Now, that is the circumference of the entire circle. If we care about this arc length, it's going to be three fourths times the circumference of the entire circle. So three over four times eight pi."
Math,"What is that going to be? Well, what's three fourths times eight? Well, three times eight is 24 divided by four is six. So this is going to be equal to six pi. Another way to think about it, one fourth of eight is two, so three fourths is going to be six. Or another way to think about it is, one fourth of eight pi is two pi, and so three of those is going to be equal to six pi. So the arc length of the partial circle is six pi, and once again we knew that because it was three fourths of the way around."
Math,"The way that I knew it was three fourths is that this is a 90 degree angle. This is 90 degrees, which is one fourth of the way around a circle, so the arc length that we care about is the three fourths of our circumference.."
Math,"And so if you look at it on both sides of this equation, if we divide-- let me rewrite it so it's a little bit clearer in a different color. So we could set up an equation pi r squared is equal to 36pi. Now, if we want to solve for the radius the first thing that we might want to do is divide both sides by pi. Then, we're left with r squared is equal to 36. Now, if we just solve this as a pure math equation, you might say, OK, we could take the positive and negative square root of 36."
Math,"r could be plus or minus 6, but we need to remember that r is a distance, so we only care about the positive. So if we take the principal root of 36, we get r is equal to 6. From there, we can use this to figure out the circumference. So the circumference is equal to 2 pi r. Circumference is equal to 2 pi r. And in this case, r is equal to 6. So it's equal to 2 pi times 6, which is going to be equal to 12pi."
Math,"So that's straightforward, area 36pi, we leverage pi r squared to figure out that the radius was 6, and then from that we were able to figure out that the circumference was 12pi.."
Math,"So the area of this would be the area of what a 10 by 10 square would be minus the area of these quarter circles. And each of these quarter circles is a quarter of a circle with a radius 3. I think we can assume that all of these, if you took the distance from here to the outside of this quarter circle, have radius 3. So if you put four quarter circles together, you're going to have a complete white circle."
Math,"So one way to think about this is that the area of this whole red region is going to be the area of the entire square, which is 10 by 10. So it's going to be 10 times 10, which is 100 whatever square units we have. And then we're going to subtract out the area of the four quarter circles. And that area is going to be equivalent to the area of one circle with a radius of 3. So what's the area of a circle with radius 3? Well, the formula for area of a circle is pi r squared, or r squared pi."
Math,"So the radius is 3. So it's going to be 3 times 3, which is 9, times pi-- 9 pi. So we have 100 minus 9 pi is the area of the shaded region. And we got it right.."
Math,"And let's say its radius is X units. Whatever our units is. This distance right over here is X. And then let's think about another circle that has twice the radius. Its radius will be two X. Let me draw its radius first so it looks roughly accurate. This is two X is this circle's radius. And so this circle might look something like that. That's my best attempt at freehand drawing a circle. Let's just think about what the circumference of both of these are, and what the areas of both of these are."
Math,"The circumference of any circle is two pi times the radius. So, in this case, the circumference, and I'll use C for circumference, is equal to two pi times the radius. Which, in this case, is X. What's the circumference here? Once again, the circumference is equal to two pi times the radius, but this time the radius is two X. So, the circumference is equal to two times pi times two times X, which is the same thing as two times two times pi times X, or we could write it as four pi X."
Math,"We see here that this circumference is twice as large as this one. To go from two pi X, to four pi X, you have to multiply by two. You double the radius, it doubled the circumference. What about the area? And I'll do area in a new color. We already know that area is equal to pi R squared. In this circle the radius is of length X. It's pi times X squared. In this circle, right over here, the area is going to be equal to pi times the radius squared, but now the radius is two X. Two X squared."
Math,"What is this going to be equal to? Our area is equal to pi. Two X squared is two X times two X, which is the same thing as four X squared. Four X squared. Or, we could rewrite this as area is equal to four pi X squared. Notice, now the area has increased not by a factor of two. The area has increased by a factor of four when we doubled the radius. Why did this happen? I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. It comes straight out the formulas for circumference and area."
Math,"Remember, circumference is equal to two pi R, while area... Let me do this in a different color. While area is equal to pi R squared. You see here, area is proportional to the square of the radius. If you double this, you're gonna increase your area by a factor of four. If you triple it, if you triple your radius, you're gonna increase your area by a factor of nine. If you increase radius by a factor of four, you're gonna increase your area by a factor of four squared, or 16."
Math,"While, circumference, whatever factor you increase you increase your radius, the circumference is going to increase by that same factor. And if you don't believe me, I mean, we essentially showed it right here through a little bit of algebra, but you could try it out with as many numbers as you see fit.."
Math,"And let's say that there's also a ray AC. So let's say that C is sitting right over there. And then I can draw another ray that goes through C. So this is ray AC. And what's interesting about these two rays is that they have the exact same vertex. They have the exact same vertex at A. And in general, what we have when we have two rays that have the exact same vertex, you have an angle."
Math,"And you're probably already reasonably familiar with the concept of an angle, which I believe comes from the Latin for corner, which makes sense. This looks like a little bit of a corner right over here that we see at point A. But the geometric definition, or the one that you're most likely to see, is when two rays share a common vertex. And that common vertex is actually called the vertex of the angle. So A is the vertex."
Math,"Not only is it the vertex of each of these rays, ray AB and ray AC, it is also the vertex of the angle. So the next thing I want to think about is how do we label an angle. You might be tempted to just label it angle A. But I'll show you in a second why that's not going to be so clear to someone, based on where our angle is actually sitting."
Math,"So the way that you specify an angle-- and hopefully this will make sense in a second-- is that you say angle-- this is the symbol for angle, and it actually looks strangely similar to this angle right over here. But this little pointy thing, or it almost looks like a less-than sign. But it's not quite. It's flat on the bottom right over here. This is the symbol for angle. You'd say angle BAC. Or you could say angle CAB. In either case, they're kind of specifying this corner."
Math,"Or sometimes you could view it as this opening right over here. And the important thing to realize is that you have the vertex in the middle of the letters. Now you might be saying, wait, why go through the trouble of listing all three of these letters. Why can't I just call this angle A? And to see that, let me show you another diagram."
Math,"And although the geometric definition of an angle involves two rays that have the same vertex, in practice, you're going to see many angles that are made up of lines and line segments. And you could imagine that you could continue those line segments on and on in one direction. And then they would become rays. So in that way, they're consistent with this definition. But let's say I have one line segment that looks like that. Let me label some points here. So we've already used ABC."
Math,"So I'm going to call this D and E, points D and E. So this is line segment DE. And let's say I also have a line segment FG. And let's say this point where these two line segments intersect, let's call that point point H. Now how could we specify this angle right over here? Can we just call that angle H? Well, no. Because if we just said angle H, the angle that has a vertex H, it could be this angle right over here. Or it could be this angle right over here. Let me draw it this way."
Math,"You could view it that way. Or it could be that angle over there. It could be this angle over here. It could be this angle over here. Or it could be that angle over there. And so the only way to really specify which angle you're talking about well, is to give three letters. So if you really did want to talk about that angle right over there, you would call that angle EHG. So that is angle EHG. Or you could actually call that angle GHE."
Math,"If you wanted to specify this angle right over here, the one made up of, if you imagine that ray and that ray, if you were to keep on going past those points, then you could call that angle DHG, or angle GHD. I think you get the point. This angle up here could be FHD or EHF. And this one could be FHD or DHF. And when you do it this way, it's very clear what angle you are referring to."
Math,"So now that we have a general idea of what an angle is, and kind of how do we denote it with symbols, the next thing you might be curious about is, it doesn't look like all angles are kind of the same. It seems like some angles open up or are more open than others. And some are a little bit more closed in than others. And that actually is the case. So for example, let's take two angles here. So let's say I have one angle that looks like that. So I'll started reusing letters."
Math,"So let's say that this is A, B and C. I could make these rays. I could keep on going and make them rays if I like. Or I could just keep them as line segments. So right over here, I have angle BAC. And let's say over here, I have angle-- so let me draw another one-- and let's say this is angle XYZ. And once again, I could draw them as rays if I like, to go on and on and on. So it's angle XY and Z. And so when you just look at these, you just eyeball these two angles, it looks like this one is more open."
Math,"So this one looks more open. While this one over here looks more closed, at least relative to this one. So maybe when we measure angles, we should measure it based on how open or closed they are. And that actually is the case. And so without even telling you how we measure an angle, you could say that the measure of angle XYZ, the measure of this angle, is greater than the measure of this angle right over here."
Math,And any convention we use for measuring angles is essentially going to be a measure of how open or how closed an angle actually is. And I'll take that up in the next video where we'll see how to actually measure an angle..
Math,"And then also let's say that we have another angle called DBA. I want to have the vertex once again at B. So let's say it looks like this. So this right over here is our point D. That is our point D. And let's say that we know that the measure of angle DBA is equal to 40 degrees. So this angle right over here, its measure is equal to 40 degrees. And let's say that we know that the measure of angle ABC is equal to 50 degrees."
Math,"So there's a bunch of interesting things happening The first interesting thing that you might realize is that both of these angles share a side. If you view these as rays-- they could be lines, line segments, or rays-- but if you view them as rays, they both share this ray BA. And when you have two angles like this that share the same side, these are called adjacent angles. Because the word ""adjacent"" literally means next to. These are adjacent. They are adjacent angles."
Math,"Now there's something else that you might notice that's interesting here. We know that the measure of angle DBA is 40 degrees and the measure of angle ABC is 50 degrees. And you might be able to guess what the measure of angle DBC If we drew a protractor over here-- I'm not going to draw it. It will make my drawing all messy. Well, maybe I'll draw it really fast. So if you had a protractor right over here, clearly this is opening up to 50 degrees. And this is going another 40 degrees."
Math,"So if you wanted to say what the measure of angle DBC is, it would essentially be the sum of 40 degrees and 50 degrees. And let me delete all of this stuff right here to keep things clean. So the measure of angle DBC would be equal to 90 degrees. And we already know that 90 degrees is a special angle. This is a right angle. There's also a word for two angles whose sum add up to 90 degrees, and that is complementary. So we can also say that angles DBA and angles ABC are complementary."
Math,"And that is because their measures add up to 90 degrees. So the measure of angle DBA plus the measure of angle ABC is equal to 90 degrees. They form a right angle when you add them up. And just as another point of terminology that's kind of related to right angles, when a right angle is formed, the two rays that form the right angle or the two lines that form that right angle or the two line segments that form that right angle are called perpendicular."
Math,"So because we know that measure of angle DBC is 90 degrees or that angle DBC is a right angle, this tells us, we know that the line segment DB is perpendicular to line segment BC. Or we could even say ray BD is-- instead of using the word perpendicular, there's sometimes this symbol right here, which really just shows two perpendicular lines-- perpendicular to BC. So all of these are true statements here. And these come out of the fact that the angle formed between DB and BC, that is a 90-degree angle."
Math,"Now, we have other words when our two angles add up to other things. So let's say, for example, I have one angle over here. Let me put some letters here so we can specify it. So let's say this is X, Y, and Z. And let's say that the measure of angle XYZ is equal to 60 degrees. And let's say that you have another angle that looks like this. And I'll call this, let's say, maybe MNO. And let's say that the measure of angle MNO is 120 degrees."
Math,"So if you were to add the two measures of these-- so let me write this down. The measure of angle MNO plus the measure of angle XYZ, this is going to be equal to 120 degrees plus 60 degrees, which is equal to 180 degrees. So if you add these two things up, you essentially are able to go all halfway around the circle. Or you could go throughout the entire half circle or semicircle for a protractor. And when you have two angles that add up to 180 degrees, we call them supplementary."
Math,"I know it's a little hard to remember sometimes. 90 degrees is complementary. They're just complementing each other. And then if you add up to 180 degrees, you have supplementary. You have supplementary angles. And if you have two supplementary angles that are adjacent so that they share a common side-- so let me draw that over here. So let's say you have one angle that looks like this. And that you have another angle. So let me put some letters here again. And I'll start reusing letters."
Math,"So let's say that this is ABC. And you have another angle that looks like this. I already used C. Once again, let's say that this is 50 degrees. And let's say that this right over here is 130 degrees. Clearly, angle DBA plus angle ABC, if you add them together, you get 130 degrees plus 50 degrees, which is 180 degrees. So they are supplementary. So let me write that down. Angle DBA and angle ABC are supplementary. They add up to 180 degrees. But they are also adjacent angles."
Math,"And because they're supplementary and they're adjacent, if you look at the broader angle, the angle used from the sides that they don't have in common. If you look at angle DBC, this is going to be essentially a straight line, which we can call a straight angle. So I introduced you to a bunch of words here. And now I think we have all of the tools we need to start doing some interesting proofs. And just to review here, we talked about any angles that add up to 90 degrees are considered to be complementary."
Math,"This is adding up to 90 degrees. If they happen to be adjacent, then the two outside sides will form a right angle. When you have a right angle, the two sides of a right angle are considered to be perpendicular. And then if you have two angles that add up to 180 degrees, they're considered supplementary. And then if they happen to be adjacent, they will form a straight angle."
Math,"Or another way, if you said, if you have a straight angle and you have one of the angles, the other angle is going to be supplementary to it. They're going to add up to 180 degrees. So I'll leave you there.."
Math,"So that is C and that is D. And they intersect right over here at point E. And let's say we know, we're given, that this angle right over here, that the measure of angle-- That B is kind of, I don't know why I wrote it so far away. So let me make that a little bit closer. Let me make that B a little bit closer. So let's say-- I'll do that in yellow. Let's say that we know that the measure of this angle right over here, angle BED, let's say that we know that measure is 70 degrees."
Math,"Given that information, what I want to do, based only on what we know so far and not using a protractor, what I want to do is figure out what the other angles in this picture are. So what's the measure of angle CEB, the measure of angle AEC, and the measure of angle AED? So the first thing that you might notice when you look at this, I've already told you that this is a line segment and that this is a line segment. You see that angle BED and angle CEB are adjacent."
Math,"And we also see that if you take the outer sides of those angles, it forms a straight angle. And we also see that angle CED is a straight angle. So we know that these two angles must also be supplementary. They're next to each other and they form a straight angle when you take their outer sides. So we know that angle BED and angle CEB are supplementary, which means they add up to, or that their measures add up to 180 degrees. Supplementary angles."
Math,"Which tells us that the measure of angle BED plus the measure of angle CEB-- and I keep writing measure here. Sometimes you'll just see people write, angle BED plus angle CEB is equal to 180 degrees. Now we already know the measure of angle BED is 70 degrees. So we already know that this thing right over here is 70 degrees. And so 70 degrees plus the measure of angle CEB is 180 degrees. You subtract 70 from both sides, and we get the measure of angle CEB is equal to 110 degrees."
Math,"I just subtracted 70 from both sides of that. So we figured out that this right over here is 110 degrees. Well, that's interesting. And I went through more steps than you would if you were doing this problem quickly. If you did this problem quickly in your head, you'd say, look this is 70 degrees, this angle plus this angle would be 180 degrees, so this has to be 110 degrees. So now let's use the same logic to figure out what angle CEA is. So now we care about the measure of angle CEA."
Math,"And we can use the exact same logic that we used over here. Angle CEA and angle CEB, they are adjacent. They form a straight angle, if you look at their outsides, so they must be supplementary. They form a straight angle right over here. So they're supplementary. So they must add up to 180 degrees. So the measure of angle CEA plus the measure of angle CEB, which is 110 degrees, must be equal to 180 degrees. So once again, subtract 110 from both sides."
Math,"You get the measure of angle CEA is equal to 70 degrees. So this one right over here is also 70 degrees. And what we'll learn in the next video is that this is no coincidence. These two angles, angle CEA and angle BED, sometimes they're called opposite angles-- well, I have often called them opposite angles, but the more correct term for them is vertical angles. And we haven't proved it. We've just seen a special case here where these vertical angles are equal."
Math,"But it actually turns out that vertical angles are always equal. But we haven't proved it to ourselves for the general case. But let me just write down this word since it's a nice new word. So angle CEA and angle BED are vertical. And you might say, wait, they look like they're horizontal, they're next to each other. And the vertical really just means that they're across from each other, across an intersection from each other. Angle CEB and angle AED are also vertical. So let me write that down."
Math,"Angle CEB and angle AED are also vertical. And that might even make a little bit more sense, because it literally is, one is on top and one is on bottom. They're kind of vertically opposite from each other. But these horizontally opposite angles are also called vertical angles. So now we have one angle left to figure out, angle AED. And based on what I already told you, vertical angles tend to be, or they are always, equal."
Math,"But we haven't proven that to ourselves yet so we can't just use that property to say that this is 110 degrees. So what we're going to do is use the exact same logic. CEA and AED are clearly supplementary. Their outsides form a straight angle. They're clearly supplementary, so CEA and AED must add up to 180 degrees. Or we could say the measure of angle AED plus the measure of angle CEA must be equal to 180 degrees. We know the measure of CEA is 70 degrees. We know it is 70 degrees."
Math,"So you subtract 70 from both sides. You get the measure of angle AED is equal to 110 degrees. So we got the exact result that we expected. So this angle right over here is 110 degrees. And so if you take any of the adjacent angles that their outer sides form a straight angle, you see they add up to 180. This one and that one add up to 180. This one and that one add up to 180. This one and that one add up to 180. And this one and that one add up to 180."
Math,"If you go all the way around the circle, you'll see that they add up to 360 degrees. Because you literally are going all the way around. So 70 plus 110 is 180, plus 70 is 250, plus 110 is 360 degrees. I'll leave you there. This is the first time that we've kind of found some interesting results using the tool kit that we've built up so far."
Math,"In the next video, we'll actually prove to ourselves using pretty much the exact same logic here, but we'll just do it with generalized numbers-- we won't use 70 degrees-- to prove that the measure of vertical angles are equal.."
Math,"CBE is always going to be equal to its vertical angle --so, angle DBA-- then I'd prove that vertical angles are always going to be equal, because this is just a generalilzable case right over here. So what I want to prove here is angle CBE is equal to, I could say the measure of angle CBE --you will see it in different ways-- actually this time let me write it without measure so that you get used to the different notations. I will just say prove angle CBE is equal to angle DBA. Is equal to angle DBA."
Math,"So the first thing we know...the first thing we know so what do we know? We know that angle CBE, and we know that angle DBC are supplementary they are adjacent angles and their outer sides, both angles, form a straight angle over here. So we know that angle CBE and angle --so this is CBE-- and angle DBC are supplementary. I will just write ""sup"" for that. They are supplementary. Which means that angle CBE plus angle DBC is equal to 180 degrees. Fair enough."
Math,"We also know --so let me see this is CBE, this is what we care about and we want to prove that this is equal to that-- we also know that angle DBA --we know that this is DBA right over here-- we also know that angle DBA and angle DBC are supplementary this angle and this angle are supplementary, their outer sides form a straight angle, they are adjacent so they are supplementary which tells us that angle DBA, this angle right over here, plus angle DBC, this angle over here, is going to be equal to 180 degrees."
Math,"Now, from this top one, this top statement over here, we can subtract angle DBC from both sides and we get angle CBE is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC that's this information right over here, I just put the angle DBC on the right side or subtracted it from both sides of the equation and this right over here, if I do the exact same thing, subtract angle DBC from both sides of the equation, I get angle DBA is equal to 180 degrees --let me scroll over to the right a little bit-- is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC."
Math,"So clearly, angle CBE is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC angle DBA is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC so they are equal to each other! They are both equal to the same thing so we get, which is what we wanted to get, angle CBE is equal to angle DBA. Angle CBE, which is this angle right over here, is equal to angle DBA and sometimes you might see that shown like this; so angle CBE, that's its measure, and you would say that this measure right over here is the exact same amount."
Math,"And we have other vertical angles whatever this measure is, and sometimes you will see it with a double line like that, that you can say that THAT is going to be the same as whatever this angle right over here is."
Math,"You will see it written like that sometimes, I like to use colors but not all books have the luxury of colors, or sometimes you will even see it written like this to show that they are the same angle; this angle and this angle --to show that these are different-- sometimes they will say that they are the same in this way. This angle is equal to this vertical angle, is equal to its vertical angle right over here and that this angle is equal to this angle that is opposite the intersection right over here."
Math,"What we have proved is the general case because all I did here is I just did two general intersecting lines I picked a random angle, and then I proved that it is equal to the angle that is vertical to it.."
Math,"The measure of this angle right over here is 60 degrees. And the measure of this angle right over here is x. So let's try to figure out what all of these angles are. So to do that, we have to figure out what x is. And there's a big clue here, because the 60-degree angle plus the x angle, they're adjacent. And if you add these two angles together, their outer rays, our vertical angle with this 7x angle. So we could say-- and just to visualize that a little better, let me color it in."
Math,"Actually, let me do it this way. You see that this angle out here-- let me do it in a color I haven't used yet. This entire angle over here, which is going to be 60 degrees plus x, that's a vertical angle with this angle, the one that has measure 7x. So we could say that 60 degrees plus x is equal to 7x because vertical angles are equal. So let's write that down. We get 60. And we'll assume that everything is in degrees. 60 plus-- let me do that in this other color. 60 plus x is going to be equal to 7x."
Math,"And now we just have to solve for x. So the simplest thing to do would be to get all over x's on one side of the equation. I've already gotten seven x's on this right-hand side, so let's get rid of all of the x's on the left-hand side. And the easiest way to get rid of this x is to subtract x from the left-hand side. But of course, in order to keep it an equation, we can't just do something to one side. Otherwise, it won't be equal anymore. We have to do it to both sides."
Math,"So let's subtract x from both sides. And on the left-hand side, we are left with just the 60. So we're left with just a 60. And then that is going to be equal to 7x minus x. If I have 7 of something and I get rid of 1 of them, I'm going to have 6 of that something left. So that's going to be equal to 6x. So we have 6 times something is equal to 60. You could probably figure that out in your head. But I will do it a little systematically. We can divide both sides by 6 to solve for x. So let's do that."
Math,"And we would be left with x is equal to. 60 divided by 6 is 10. And we reminded ourselves that everything was in degrees. And we could even do that here. This was in degrees. This is in degrees. And so this is in degrees right over here. So the measure of this angle right over here is 10 degrees. So this one right over there is 10 degrees. This is, of course, 60 degrees. You add them together, 60 degrees plus 10 degrees is 70 degrees. So this bigger angle right over here is 70 degrees."
Math,"And of course, this one over here, it's a vertical angle. It's going to have to be the same. And we see that, 7 times x. 7 times 10 degrees is 70 degrees as well.."
Math,"What is the measure of your piece of the pie in degrees? So to tackle this, we just have to remember a few things. We have to remember that the degrees in a circle-- so if we were to go all the way around a circle that that would be 360 degrees. But we only have half a pie here. And actually, let me draw a little bit differently. So if we had a whole pie-- so if we started here, and we had a whole pie, we went all the way around, that would be 360 degrees. But we only have a half pie."
Math,"So we only have 180 degrees and let me do that in a color you're more likely to see. That's hard to see as well. We only have 180 degrees of pie left, but let's just keep that in mind and think about how we're going to split it between ourselves, our brother, and our mom. So let's define some variables. Let's let x be equal to the degree measure of my brother's pie or your little brother's pie. So this is degree measure of brother's pie."
Math,"And then what would the amount of pie you eat be? Well, it says you eat twice what your little brother eats. So 2x would be equal what you eat, and it's really the degree measure of what you eat. And then how much does your mom eat? Well, it says you cut her slice that is 30 degrees. So your mom's going to get a 30 degree slice, going to get a slice of something like that."
Math,"So the amount that your brother eats, x, plus the amount that you eat, plus the amount that your mom gets, plus 30 degrees, is going to be equal to this half pie. And remember, all of these are degree measures. So it's going to be equal to 180 degrees. And just to visualize it over here, let me draw it down here where it's easier to see it. We have half a pie that we're dealing with. We're going to save 30 degrees for our mom. So that's 30 degrees right over there. Your brother is going to eat some amount."
Math,"So that is x. And then you're going to eat twice that amount. So that is 2x. x is the measure of this angle, and then 2x is a measure of that angle. So you see that 30 degrees plus x plus 2x, or x plus 2x plus 30 degrees, is going to be equal to 180 degrees. Now, we can simplify this. If we have one of something and then have another two of it, how much do we have now? Well, I now have three x's. So 1x plus 2x is going to be 3x. So I have 3x plus 30 degrees is going to be equal to, of course, 180 degrees."
Math,"Now, to solve for x, we can subtract 30 degrees from both sides. So minus 30 degrees, minus 30 degrees. And I could have just written-- I could have all assumed that I'm doing it in degrees and then just done it at the end. I keep writing it so I'll just keep going with that. And then we are left with 3x equaling 180 degrees minus 30 degrees is equal to 150 degrees. And now we can just divide both sides by 3, and we're left with x equaling 150 divided by 3 is 50 degrees. x is equal to 50 degrees."
Math,"Now, we have to be careful. x is not what they're asking for. They're asking for the measure of your piece of pie in degrees. x is the degree measure of your brother's piece of pie. What you eat is 2 times that. So if x is 50 degrees, 2 times that is going to be 100 degrees. So what is the measure of your piece of the pie in degrees? It is going to be 100 degrees. So if we draw our pie again, if we draw our half pie, you have 30 degrees for your mom. So that's 30 degrees for your mom."
Math,"You have 50 degrees for your brother. And then you have twice that for yourself, 100 degrees.."
Math,"Then they tell us that the measure of angle LOM is equal to 2x plus 46. So LOM-- so this angle right over here-- is equal to 2x plus 46. Then they tell us that the measure of angle MON is equal to 3x minus 6. So this angle right over here is 3x minus 6. And so they ask us find angle MON. So we need to find this angle right over here. And we'd be able to find it if we knew what x is. If we knew what x is, then it's going to be 3 times that minus 6."
Math,"Now, the one thing that we know is that if we add up these two angles, these are adjacent angles. And their outside rays form a right angle. So these two angles are going to add up to 90 degrees. And I guess we can assume here that we're dealing in degrees. So let's say that 2x plus 46 plus 3x minus 6 is going to add up to 90 degrees. These two angles are complementary. So it's going to add up to 90 degrees, or it's going to add up to 90. And now, we just have to simplify. We have 2 x's."
Math,"We have another 3 x's. So you add those two, and you're going to get 5 x's. And then you have 46. And you're going to subtract 6. So it's going to be plus 40 is equal to 90. Subtract 40 from both sides. So let's do that. Subtract 40 from both sides. And on the left-hand side, you're just left with a 5x. And on the right-hand side, you're left with a 50. Now, just divide both sides by 5. And we are left with x is equal to 10. Now, our answer is not 10. We've just figured out what x is."
Math,"What they ask us for is what's the measure of angle MON? Well, we already know that the measure of angle MON is equal to 3x minus 6, which is equal to 3 times 10 minus 6-- I want to do that minus 6 in that green color-- which is equal to 24 degrees.."
Math,"And the measure of angle RPS-- so that's this angle right over here-- is 2x plus 22 degrees. And they ask us to find the measure of angle RPS. So we need to figure out this right over here. So we would be able to figure that out if we just knew what x is. And lucky for us, we can use the information given to solve for x and then figure out what 2 times x plus 22 is. And the main big idea here, the thing that pops out here, is that the outside rays for both of these angle form a line."
Math,"These two angles form a line. You could say that they are supplementary. Both of these angles are supplementary. 2x plus 22 plus another 2x plus 122 is going to add up to 180. We know that this entire angle right over here is 180 degrees. So we can say that the measure of angle QPR, this angle right over here, 2x plus 122, plus the green angle, plus angle RPS-- so plus 2x plus 22-- is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And now we can start simplifying this. We have two x's. We have another two x's."
Math,"So those are going to add up to be 4x. And then we have 122 plus 22. So that's going to be 144. And the sum of those two are going to be equal to 180 degrees. We can subtract 144 from both sides. On the left-hand side, we're just going to be left with a 4x, this 4x right here. And on the right-hand side, we're going to have-- let's see, if we were subtracting 140, we would have 40 left. And then we have to subtract another 4, so it's going to be 36. Divide both sides by 4, and we get x is equal to 9."
Math,"Now remember, we're not done yet. They didn't say solve for x. They said find the measure of angle RPS, which is 2 times x plus 22 or 2 times 9 plus 22, which is 18 plus 22, which is equal to 40. So the measure of angle RPS is 40 degrees.."
Math,"So those are my two intersecting lines. And let's say we know that the measure of this angle right over here is equal to 7x plus 182. And this is being given in degrees, so it's 7x plus 182 degrees. And we know that the measure of this angle right over here is 9x plus 194 degrees. So my question to you is, what is the measure of each of these angles? And I encourage you to pause the video and to think about it. Well, the thing that might jump out at you is that these two things are vertical angles."
Math,"They're the opposite angles when we have these intersecting lines right over here. And vertical angles are equal to each other. So we know, because these are vertical angles, that 9x plus 194 degrees must be equal to 7x plus 182 degrees. And now we just have to solve for x. So if we want all the x-terms on the left-hand side, we could subtract 7x from here. We've got to do it to both sides, of course, in order to maintain the equality. And then we could put all of our constant terms on the right-hand side."
Math,"So we can subtract 194 from the left. We have to subtract 194 from the right in order to maintain the inequality. And on the left, what we're left with is just 2x. And on the right, what we're left with-- let's see. 182 minus 194. So if it was 194 minus 182, it would be positive 12. But now it's going to be negative 12. We're subtracting the larger from the smaller, so it's equal to negative 12. And then divide both sides by 2. And we get x is equal to negative 6."
Math,"And now we can use that information to find out the measure of either one of these angles, which is the same as the other one. So we can see here that if we take 7 times negative 6 plus 182, so 7 times negative 6 is negative 42, plus 182 is going to be equal to 140 degrees. And you'll see the same thing over here. If we say 9 times negative 6, which is negative 54, plus 194, this also equals 140 degrees.."
Math,"Sides of length 2, 2, and 5. Can you do this? Well, let's try to do it. And we'll start with the longest side, the side of length 5. So the side of length 5. That's that side right over there. And now, let's try to draw the sides of length 2. Every side on a triangle, obviously, connects with every other side. So that's one side of length 2. And then this is another side of lengths 2. Another side of length 2. And you might say, fine, these aren't touching right now, these two points."
Math,"In order to make a triangle, we have to touch them. So let me move them closer to each other. But we have to remember, we have to keep these side lengths the same. And we have to keep touching the side of length 5 at its endpoint. So we could try to move them in. We could try to move them in, but what's going to happen? Well, you could rotate them all the way down and they're still not going to touch because 2 plus 2 is still not equal to 5. They rotate all the way down, they're still going to be 1 apart."
Math,"So you cannot construct this triangle. You cannot construct this triangle. And I think you're noticing a property of triangles. The longest side cannot be longer than the sum of the other two sides. Here, the sum of the other two sides is 4. 2 plus 2 is 4. And the other side is longer. And even if the other side was exactly equal to the sum of the other two sides, you're going to have a degenerate triangle. Let me draw that. So this would be side, say, 2, 2, and 4. So let's draw the side of length 4."
Math,"Side of length 4. Side of length 4. Let me draw it a little bit shorter. So that's your side of length 4. And then, in order to make the two sides of length 2 touch, in order to make them touch, you have to rotate them all the way inward You have to rotate them all the way inward so that both this angle and this angle essentially have to become 0 degrees. And so your resulting triangle, if you rotate this one all the way in and you rotate this all the way in, the points will actually touch."
Math,"But this triangle will have no area anymore. This will become a degenerate triangle. And it really looks more like a line segment. So let me write that down. This is a degenerate. In order for you to draw a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the other two sides have to be longer than the longest side. So for example, you could definitely draw a triangle with sides of length 3, 3, and 5."
Math,"So if that's the side of length 5, and then this-- if you were to rotate all the way in, those two points would-- let me draw this a little bit neater. So let's say that's where they connect. And we know that we could do that, because if you think about it, if you were to keep rotating these, they're going to pass each other at some point. They're going to have to overlap. If you tried to make a degenerate triangle, these points wouldn't touch. They'd actually overlap by one unit right over here."
Math,"So you could rotate them out and actually form a non-degenerate triangle. So this one, you absolutely could. And then there's another interesting question, is this the only triangle that you could construct that has sides of length 3, 3, and 5? Well, you can't change this length. So you can't change that point and that point. And then, you can't change these two lengths. So the only place where they will be able to touch each other is going to be right over there."
Math,"So this right over here is the only triangle that meets those constraints. You could rotate it and whatever else. But if you rotate this, it's still the same triangle. This is the only triangle that has sides of length 3, 3, and 5. You can't change any of the angles somehow to get a different triangle.."
Math,"And let's say that this side right over here has length x. And what I'm going to think about is how large or how small that value x can be. How large or small can this side be? So the first question is how small can it get? Well, if we want to make this small, we would just literally have to look at this angle right over here. So let me take a look at this angle and make it smaller. So let's try to make that angle as small as possible. So we have our 10 side. Actually let me do it down here."
Math,"So you have your 10 side, the side of length 10, and I'm going to make this angle really, really, really small, approaching 0. If that angle becomes 0, we end up with a degenerate triangle. It essentially becomes one dimension. We lose our two-dimensionality there. But as we approach 0, this side starts to coincide or get closer and closer to the 10 side. And you could imagine the case where it actually coincides with it and you actually get the degenerate."
Math,"So if want this point right over here to get as close as possible to that point over there, essentially minimizing your distance x, the closest way is if you make the angle the way equal to 0, all the way. So let's actually-- let me draw a progression. So now the angle is getting smaller. This is length 6. x is getting smaller. Then we keep making that angle smaller and smaller and smaller all the way until we get a degenerate triangle. So let me draw that pink side. So you have the side of length 10."
Math,"Now the angle is essentially 0, this angle that we care about. So this side is length 6. And so what is the distance between this point and this point? And that distance is length x. So in the degenerate case, this length right over here is x. We know that 6 plus x is going to be equal to 10. So in this degenerate case, x is going to be equal to 4. So if you want this to be a real triangle, at x equals 4 you've got these points as close as possible. It's degenerated into a line, into a line segment."
Math,"If you want this to be a triangle, x has to be greater than 4. Now let's think about it the other way. How large can x be? Well to think about larger and larger x's, we need to make this angle bigger. So let's try to do that. So let's draw my 10 side again. So this is my 10 side. I'm going to make that angle bigger and bigger. So now let me take my 6 side and put it like that. And so now our angle is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. It's approaching 180 degrees."
Math,"At 180 degrees, our triangle once again will be turned into a line segment. It'll become a degenerate triangle. So let me draw the side of length x, try to draw it straight. So we're trying to maximize the distance between that point and that point. So this is side of length x and let's go all the way to the degenerate case. In the degenerate case, at 180 degrees, the side of length 6 forms a straight line with the side of length 10."
Math,"And this is how you can get this point and that point as far apart as possible. Well, in this situation, what is the distance between that point and that point, which is the distance which is going to be our x? Well in this situation, x is going to be 6 plus 10 is 16. If x is 16, we have a degenerate triangle. If we don't want a degenerate triangle, if we want to have two dimensions to the triangle, then x is going to have to be less than 16."
Math,"Now the whole principle that we're working on right over here is called the triangle inequality theorem and it's a pretty basic idea. That any one side of a triangle has to be less, if you don't want a degenerate triangle, than the sum of the other two sides. So length of a side has to be less than the sum of the lengths of other two sides."
Math,"If you're willing to deal with degenerate triangles-- where you essentially form a line segment, you lose all your dimensionality, you turn to a one-dimensional figure-- then you could say less than or equal, but we're just going to stick to non-degenerate triangles. So the length of a side has to be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. And just using this principle, we could have come up with the same exact conclusion. You could say, well look, x is one of the sides."
Math,"It has to be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. So it has to be less than 6 plus 10, or x has to be less than 16-- the exact same result we got by visualizing it like this. You want to say how large can x be? Well you could say, well, 10 has to be less than-- Or how small can x be? You have to say 10 has to be less than 6 plus x, the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. If you subtract 6 from both sides right over here, you get 4 is less than x, or x is greater than 4."
Math,"So this is a, in some level, it's a kind of a basic idea, but it's something that you'll see definitely in geometry. And then you'll go far into other types of mathematics and you'll see other versions of what's essentially this triangle inequality theorem.."
Math,"But it's still a three-dimensional solid. And I were to make a cut-- let's say I were to make a cut right over here. So let's say I had this big, sharp metal thing-- let me draw it like that. So you have this big, sharp metal thing. Let me draw it a little bit neater. So you have this big, sharp metal thing that I'm going to cut right over here. So this is the thing that I'm going to make the cut. And I'm going to go straight down. This is a vertical cut that we're talking about."
Math,"So this is the thing that I'm going to cut with. Let me make it big enough so that it can capture the shape that will result. So this thing right over here, it's right in front. And I'm going to cut-- I'm going to make it go straight down and cut through this jello, or whatever you want to call it, this rectangular pyramid of jello."
Math,And what would be the resulting shape of the intersection between the jello and this thing that I'm using to cut it? And now I encourage you to pause your video and think about what the resulting shape would be. And the shape would be in two dimensions. Because this purple surface is a two-dimensional-- you could view it as part of a plane. And so where this intersects when you cut down this rectangular pyramid is the shape we're looking for.
Math,"So I encourage you to pause the video and think about it or try to come up with it on your own. So let's think about it. And let me draw the rectangular pyramid again. So that's the same one. And now let me see what it would look like once I've done my cut, once I've brought this thing down. So then this is where I cut. So I cut it right over here. And then it'll exit the bottom. It'll cut along this side like that, cut along that side like that. And then it'll exit the bottom right over there."
Math,"And so let me draw my whole thing. And so once I slice it down, it will look like this. My best shot at drawing it-- it will look like this. This is a vertical cut. So I've brought this thing down. And now the intersection between the thing that I'm cutting with and this pyramid is going to be this shape right over here. It cut into the top right over there. It would get all the way to the bottom right over there. And along this side, it would cut right there."
Math,"And along that side, it would cut right over there. So what's the resulting shape in two dimensions of essentially the intersection between the slicer and the jello? Well, it would be this thing. It would look like a trapezoid. Let me do that in a new color. I'm overusing that one color. It would look like a trapezoid. So this would be the resulting shape. So the resulting shape would look like this. Just like that, if you made the cut right over there.."
Math,"And he fills the glass 4 inches high with water. So you see that over here, 4 inches high with water. Jamie drops his gold ring in the glass and measures the new height of the water to be 4.25 inches. So this is after the gold ring is dropped. What is the volume of Jamie's ring in cubic inches? Well when you start with this water right over here and you add his ring, whatever that volume is of his ring is going to displace an equal volume of water and push it up."
Math,"And so the incremental volume that you now have is essentially going to be the volume of his ring. Well what is the incremental volume here? Well it's going to be the volume. If you think about going from this before volume to the after volume, the difference is the base stays the same. It's 3 inches by 2 inches, the difference is-- to make it a little bit neater-- the base is the same. The difference is the height."
Math,"The height now is 4.25 inches after dropping in the ring So the water went up by 0.25 inches. Let me write that, 0.25 inches is what the water went up by. So we could just think about, what is this incremental volume going to be? So this incremental volume right over here, that I'm shading in with purple. Well to figure that out we just have to measure. We just have to multiply the length times the width times the height times 0.25. So it's just going to be 3 times 2 times 0.25."
Math,"3 times 2 is 6, times 0.25, and you could do that either on paper or you might be able do that in your head. 4 times 0.25 is going to be 1, and you have 2 more times 0.25, that's going to be 0.5. So this is going to be 1.50. And we multiply it inches times inches times inches. So this is going to be in terms of cubic inches. 1.5 cubic inches is the volume of Jamie's ring, which is actually a pretty sizable volume for a gold ring."
Math,"Maybe he has a very big finger or he just likes to spend, or I guess is his, whoever bought him the ring likes to spend a lot on gold.."
Math,"This is what a triangular prism looks like, where it has a triangle on one, two faces, and they're kind of separated. They kind of have rectangles in between. The other types of triangular three-dimensional figures is you might see pyramids. This would be a rectangular pyramid, because it has a rectangular-- or it has a square base, just like that. You could also have a triangular pyramid, which it's just literally every side is a triangle. So stuff like that. But this over here is a triangular prism."
Math,"I don't want to get too much into the shape classification. If the base of the triangle b is equal to 7, the height of the triangle h is equal to 3, and the length of the prism l is equal to 4, what is the total volume of the prism? So they're saying that the base is equal to 7. So this base, this right over here is equal to 7. The height of the triangle is equal to 3. So this right over here, this distance right over here, h, is equal to 3. And the length of the prism is equal to 4."
Math,"So I'm assuming it's this dimension over here is equal to 4. So length is equal to 4. So in this situation, what you really just have to do is figure out the area of this triangle right over here. We could figure out the area of this triangle and then multiply it by how much you go deep, so multiply it by this length. So the volume is going to be the area of this triangle-- let me do it in pink-- the area of this triangle. We know that the area of a triangle is 1/2 times the base times the height."
Math,"So this area right over here is going to be 1/2 times the base times the height. And then we're going to multiply it by our depth of this triangular prism. So we have a depth of 4. So then we're going to multiply that times the 4, times this depth. And we get-- let's see, 1/2 times 4 is 2. So these guys cancel out. You'll just have a 2. And then 2 times 3 is 6. 6 times 7 is 42. And it would be in some type of cubic units. So if these were in-- I don't know-- centimeters, it would be centimeters cubed."
Math,"But they're not making us focus on the units in this problem. Let's do another one. Shown is a cube. If each side is of equal length x equals 3, what is the total volume of the cube? So each side is equal length x, which happens to equal 3. So this side is 3. This side over here, x is equal to 3. Every side, x is equal to 3. So it's actually the same exercise as the triangular prism."
Math,"It's actually a little bit easier when you're dealing with the cube, where you really just want to find the area of this surface right over here. Now, this is pretty straightforward. This is just a square, or it would be the base times the height. Or essentially the same, it's just 3 times 3. So the volume is going to be the area of this surface, 3 times 3, times the depth. And so we go 3 deep, so times 3. And so we get 3 times 3 times 3, which is 27. Or you might recognize this from exponents."
Math,"This is the same thing as 3 to the third power. And that's why sometimes, if you have something to the third power, they'll say you cubed it. Because, literally, to find the volume of a cube, you take the length of one side, and you multiply that number by itself three times, one for each dimension-- one for the length, the width, and-- or I guess the height, the length, and the depth, depending on how you want to define them. So it's literally just 3 times 3 times 3.."
Math,"Each crate has a base 5 meters long by 1.5 meters wide. So let me draw that. So crate is 5 meters long, and 1.5 meters wide, and has a height of 2 meters. So its height might look something like this. So it has a height of 2 meters. So that's each of the crates. And they're designed to fit inside a boxcar. So this is a crate right over here. I'll do my best to draw a crate. And they give us the dimensions of the boxcar. A boxcar is 15 meters long. So let me draw a boxcar here. So it's 15 meters long."
Math,"Maybe I'll try to make sure I can fit it on the page. So that this whole distance would be 5 meters, and then another 5 meters here, and then another 5 meters here. So that would be 15 meters long. So you could fit three of the crates along an edge like that. And then, they tell us that it is 3 meters wide. So this is 1.5 meters wide. So you could put two of these to get you to 3 meters. Let me draw this so we can see what's going on behind the scenes."
Math,"So you could go 3 meters wide for a boxcar, and then it is 4 meters high. So each of these are 2 meters high. So you could stack one more. And so you have 2 meters plus 2 meters. This entire distance right over here is going to be 4 meters. And I could draw the rest of the boxcar like this. So there's a couple of ways to think about how many crates you could fit in a boxcar. One way would be just the way that we're doing it right now. We could visualize."
Math,"How many can you fit in this direction along the length? How many can you fit along the width? And how many can you fit along the height? And essentially, if we multiply those three numbers, we would have counted the number of crates that could fit inside. So you could fit 1, 2, 3 along the length. So that'd be 3. You could fit 2 along the width. 1.5 and 1.5 gets you to 3 meters, so times 2. And then you could fit 2 along the height, so times 2, gets us to 3 times 2 is 6 times 2 is 12."
Math,"You can fit 12 crates in the boxcar. Now, another way you could have done it is you could say, OK, they're telling us that these are designed to fit. So we really just have to compare the volumes. How many times more is the volume of the box car than the crate? I like doing it this way more, just to make sure that the dimensions actually work out, so that you could actually squeeze these in."
Math,"Because if the dimensions aren't right, even if the boxcar is 12 times the volume of one of the crates, if the crates don't have the right dimensions, you might not be able to squeeze exactly 12 crates in there. But they're telling us that it is the exact dimensions. So we could figure out the dimensions of the boxcar, then the dimensions of the crate. And then we could figure out how much larger the boxcar is, how many times larger. Let's do the boxcar in this blue color."
Math,"The boxcar is 15 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 4 meters high. So boxcar volume is equal to 15 in cubic meters. So there's 15 meters times 3 meters times 4 meters. So this is going to be in cubic meters. So this is going to be-- let's see, 15 times 3 is 45. 45 times 4 is 180 cubic meters. That's the boxcar volume. And then what's the volume of the crate? Well, the crate volume-- if we do our math right, it should come out to 1/12 of this, because that's what we just figured out, is 5 times 1.5 times 2."
Math,"So 5 times 1.5 times 2. Well, 1.5 times 2 is 3, times 5 is 15, so 15 cubic meters. So how many times larger is the boxcar than the crate? Well, what's 180 divided by 15? Well, it's exactly 12. 10 times 15 is 150. And then 2 times 15 is 30. 150 plus 30 is 180. So notice, 180 divided by 15 is 12. So either way, however you think about it-- I find this one to be a little bit easier to kind of just visualize the boxes-- you can fit 12 crates in the boxcar.."
Math,"So we want to express 19/27 – which is the same thing as 19 ÷ 27 – as a decimal. So let's divide 27 into 19. So 27 going into 19. And we know it's going to involve some decimals over here, because 27 is larger than 19, and it doesn't divide perfectly. So let's get into this. So 27 doesn't go into 1. It doesn't go into 19. It does go into 190. And it looks like 27 is roughly 30. It's a little less than 30. 30 times 6 would be 180. So let's go with it going 6 times. Let's see if that works out."
Math,"Well, 6 × 7 is 42. 6 × 2 is 12, + 4 is 16. And when we subtract, 190 - 162 is going to get us – Actually, we could've had another 27 in there. Because when we subtract – So we get a 10 from the 10's place. So that becomes 8 10's. This became 28. So we could have put one more 27 in there. So let's do that. So let's put one more 27 in there. So 7 27's. 7 × 7 is 49. 7 × 2 is 14, + 4 is 18. And now our remainder is 1. We can bring down another 0. 27 goes into 10 0 times. 0 × 27 is 0."
Math,"[Not ""10,"" as Sal states by mistake.] Subtract – we have a remainder of 10. But now, we have to bring down another 0. So let's bring down this 0 right over here. So now, 27 goes into 100 3 times. 3 × 27 is 60 + 21, is 81. And then we subtract: 100 - 81. Well, we could take 100 from the 100's place, and make it 10 10's. And then we could take 1 of those 10's from the 10's place and turn it into 10 1's. And so 9 10's minus 8 10's is equal to 1 10. And then 10 -1 is 9. So it's equal to 19."
Math,"You probably – You might have been able to do that in your head. And then we have – And I see something interesting here – because when we bring down our next 0, we see 190 again. We saw 190 up here. But let's just keep going. So 27 goes into 190 – And we already played this game. It goes into it 7 times. 7 × 27 – we already figured out – was 189. We subtracted. We had a remainder of 1. Then we brought down another 0. We said 27 goes into 10 0 times. 0 × 27 is 0. Subtract."
Math,"Then you have – We still have the 10, but we've got to bring down another 0. So you have 27, which goes into 100 – (We've already done this.) –3 times. So you see something happening here. It's 0.703703. And we're just going to keep repeating 703. This is going to be equal to 0.703703703703 – on and on and on forever."
Math,"So the notation for representing a repeating decimal like this is to write the numbers that repeat – in this case 7, 0, and 3 – and then you put a line over all of the repeating decimal numbers to indicate that they repeat. So you put a line over the 7, the 0, and the 3, which means that the 703 will keep repeating on and on and on. So let's actually input it into the answer box now. So it's 0.703703. And they tell us to include only the first six digits of the decimal in your answer."
Math,"And they don't tell us to round or approximate – because, obviously, if they said to round to that smallest, sixth decimal place, then you would round up because the next digit is a 7. But they don't ask us to round. They just say, ""Include only the first six digits of the decimal in your answer."" So that should do the trick. And it did.."
Math,"And sometimes it'll be written like that, which just means that the 7 keeps on repeating. So this is the same thing as 0.7777 and I could just keep going on and on and on forever with those 7s. So the trick to converting these things into fractions is to essentially set this equal to a variable. And we'll just show it, do it step-by-step. So let me set this equal to a variable. Let me call this x. So x is equal to 0.7, and then the 7 repeats on and on forever."
Math,"Now what would 10x be? Well, let's think about this. 10x would just be 10 times this. And we could even think of it right over here. It would be, if we multiplied this times 10, you'd be moving the decimal 1 over to the right, it would be 7.777, on and on and on and on forever. Or you could say it is 7.7 repeating. Now this is the trick here. So let me make these equal to each other. So we know what x is. x is this, just 0.777 repeating forever. 10x is this. And this is another repeating thing."
Math,"Now the way that we can get rid of the repeating decimals is if we subtract x from 10x. Right? Because x has all these 0.7777. If you subtract that from 7.77777, then you're just going to be left with 7. So let's do that. So let me rewrite it here just so it's a little bit neater. 10x is equal to 7.7 repeating, which is equal to 7.777 on and on forever. And we established earlier that x is equal to 0.7 repeating, which is equal to 0.777 on and on and on forever."
Math,"Now what happens if you subtract x from 10x? So we're going to subtract the yellow from the green. Well, 10 of something minus 1 of something is just going to be 9 of that something. And then that's going to be equal to, what's 7.7777 repeating minus 0.77777 going on and on forever repeating? Well it's just going to be 7. These parts are going to cancel out. You're just left with 7. Or you could say these two parts cancel out. You're just left with 7. And so you get 9x is equal to 7."
Math,"To solve for x, you just divide both sides by 9. Let's divide both sides by nine. I could do all three sides, although these are really saying the same thing. And you get x is equal to 7/9. Let's do another one. I'll leave this one here so you can refer to it. So let's say I have the number 1.2 repeating. So this is the same thing as 1.2222 on and on and on. Whatever the bar is on top of, that's the part that repeats on and on forever. So just like we did over here, let's set this equal to x."
Math,"And then let's say 10x. Let's multiply this by 10. So 10x is equal to, it would be 12.2 repeating, which is the same thing as 12.222 on and on and on and on. And then we can subtract x from 10x. And you don't have to rewrite it, but I'll rewrite it here just so we don't get confused. So we have x is equal to 1.2 repeating. And so if we subtract x from 10x, what do we get? On the left-hand side, we get 10x minus x is 9x. And this is going to be equal to, well, the 2 repeating parts cancel out."
Math,"This cancels with that. If 2 repeating minus 2 repeating, that's just a bunch of 0. So it's 12 minus 1 is 11. And you have 9x is equal to 11. Divide both sides by 9. You get x is equal to 11/9.."
Math,"is the same thing as 0 point-- since the bar's over the 3 and the 6, both of those repeat-- 363636. And it just keeps going on and on and on like that forever. Now the key to doing this type of problem is, so like we did in the last video, we set this as equal to x. And instead of just multiplying it by 10-- 10 would only shift it one over-- we want to shift it over enough so that when we line them up, the decimal parts will still line up with each other."
Math,"And to do that we, want to actually shift the decimal space two to the right. And to shift it two to the right, we have to have multiplied by 100 or 10 to the second power. So 100x is going to be equal to what? We're shifting this two to the right-- one, two. So 100x is going to be equal to-- the decimal is going to be there now, so it's going to be 36.363636 on and on and on forever. And then let me rewrite x over here. We're going to subtract that from the 100x."
Math,"x is equal to 0.363636 repeating on and on forever. And notice when we multiplied by 100x, the 3's and the 6's still line up with each other when we align the decimals. And you want to make sure you get the decimals lined up appropriately. And the reason why this is valuable is now that when we subtract x from 100x, the repeating parts will cancel out. So let's subtract. Let us subtract these two things. So on the left-hand side, we have 100x minus x. So that gives us 99x."
Math,"And then we get, on the right-hand side, this part cancels out with that part. And we're just left with 36. We can divide both sides by 99, and we are left with x is equal to 36 over 99. And both the numerator and the denominator is divisible by 9, so we can reduce this. If we divide the numerator by 9, we get 4. The denominator by 9-- we get 11. So 0.363636 forever and forever repeating is 4/11. Now let's do another interesting one. Let's say we have the number 0.714, and the 14 is repeating."
Math,"And so this is the same thing. So notice, the 714 isn't going to repeat. Just the 14 is going to repeat. So this is 0.7141414, on and on and on and on. So let's set this equal to x. Now you might be tempted to multiply this by 1,000x to get the decimal all the way clear of 714. But you actually don't want to do that. You want to shift it just enough so that the repeating pattern can be right under itself when you do the subtraction."
Math,"So again in this situation, even though we have three numbers behind the decimal point, because only two of them are repeating, we only want to multiply by 10 to the second power. So once again, you want to multiply by 100. So you get 100x is equal to-- we're moving the decimal two to the right, one, two-- so it's going to be 71.4141, on and on and on and on. So it's going to be 71.4141414 and on and on and on. And then let me rewrite x right below this. We have x is equal to 0.7141414."
Math,"And notice, now the 141414's, they're lined up right below each other. So it's going to work out when we subtract. So let's subtract these things. 100x minus x is 99x. And this is going to be equal to-- these 1414's are going to cancel with those 1414's. And we have 71.4 minus 0.7. And we can do this in our head, or we can borrow if you like. This could be a 14. This is a 0. So you have 14 minus 7 is 7 and then 70 minus 0. So you have 99x is equal to 70.7. And then we can divide both sides by 99."
Math,"And you could see all of the sudden something strange is happening because we still have a decimal. But we can fix that up at the end. So let's divide both sides by 99. You get x is equal to 70.7 over 99. Now obviously, we haven't converted this into a pure fraction yet. We still have a decimal in the numerator. But that's pretty easy to fix. You just have to multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to get rid of this decimal. So let's multiply the numerator by 10 and the denominator by 10."
Math,"And so we get 707/990. Let's do one more example over here. So let's say we had something like-- let me write this way-- 3.257 repeating, and we want to convert this into a fraction. So once again, we set this equal to x. And notice, this is going to be 3.257257257. The 257 is going to repeat on and on and on. Since we have three digits that are repeating, we want to think about 1,000x, 10 to the third power times x. And that'll let us shift it just right so that the repeating parts can cancel out."
Math,"So 1,000x is going to be equal to what? We're going to shift the decimal three to the right-- one, two, three. So it's going to be 3,257 point-- and then the 257 keeps repeating. 257257257 keeps going on and on and on forever. And then we're going to subtract x from that. So here is x. x is equal to 3. You want to make sure you have your decimals lined up. It's 3.257257257 dot, dot, dot-- keeps going on forever."
Math,"And notice, when we multiplied it by 1,000, it allowed us to line up the 257's so that when we subtract, the repeating part cancels out. So let's do that subtraction. On the left-hand side, 1,000 of something minus 1 of that something-- you're left with 999 of that something. This part is going to cancel out with that part. It's going to be equal to-- let's see, 7 minus 3 is 4. And then you have the 5, the 2, and the 3. So you get 999x is equal to 3,254. And then you can divide both sides of this by 999."
Math,"And you are left with x is equal to 3,254/999. And so obviously, this is an improper fraction. The numerator is larger than the denominator. You could convert this to a proper fraction if you like. One way, you could have just tried to figure out what to the 0.257 repeating forever is equal to and just had the 3 being the whole number part of a mixed fraction. Or you could just divide 999 into 3,254. Actually, we could do that pretty straightforwardly."
Math,"It goes into it three times, and the remainder-- well, let me just do it, just to go through the motions. So 999 goes into 3,254. It'll go into it three times. And we know that because this is originally 3.257, so we're just going to find the remainder. So 3 times 9 is 27. But we have to add the 2, so it's 29. 3 times 9 is 27. We have a 2, so it's 29. And so we are left with, if we subtract, if we regroup or borrow or however we want to call it, this could be a 14. And then this could be a 4."
Math,"Let me do this in a new color. And then the 4 is still smaller than this 9, so we need to regroup again. So then this could be a 14, and then this could be a 1. But this is smaller than this 9 right over here, so we regroup again. This would be an 11, and then this is a 2. 14 minus 7 is 7. 14 minus 9 is 5. 11 minus 9 is 2. So we are left with-- did I do that right? Yep-- so this is going to be equal to 3 and 257/999. And we're done.."
Math,"So, let's start with an example. So, we know that three to the second power is what? Three squared is what? Well, that's the same thing as three times three and that's going to be equal to nine. But what if we went the other way around? What if we started with the nine, and we said, well, what times itself is equal to nine? We already know that answer is three, but how could we use a symbol that tells us that? So, as you can imagine, that symbol is going to be the radical here."
Math,"So, we could write the square root of nine, and when you look at this way, you say, okay, what squared is equal to nine? And you would say, well, this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, three. And I want you to really look at these two equations right over here, because this is the essence of the square root symbol. If you say the square root of nine, you're saying what times itself is equal to nine? And, well, that's going to be three."
Math,"And three squared is equal to nine, I can do that again. I can do that many times. I can write four, four squared, is equal to 16. Well, what's the square root of 16 going to be? Well, it's going to be equal to four. Let me do it again. Actually, let me start with the square root. What is the square root of 25 going to be? Well, this is the number that times itself is going to be equal to 25 or the number, where if I were to square it, I'd get to 25."
Math,"Well, what number is that, well, that's going to be equal to five. Why, because we know that five squared is equal to, five squared is equal to 25."
Math,"Now, I know that there's a nagging feeling that some of you might be having, because if I were to take negative three, and square it, and square it I would also get positive nine, and the same thing if I were to take negative four and I were to square the whole thing, I would also get positive 16, or negative five, and if I square that I would also get positive 25."
Math,"So, why couldn't this thing right over here, why can't this square root be positive three or negative three? Well, depending on who you talk to, that's actually a reasonable thing to think about. But when you see a radical symbol like this, people usually call this the principal root. Principal root. Principal, principal square root. Square root. And another way to think about it, it's the positive, this is going to be the positive square root."
Math,"If someone wants the negative square root of nine, they might say something like this. They might say the negative, let me scroll up a little bit, they might say something like the negative square root of nine. Well, that's going to be equal to negative three. And what's interesting about this is, well, if you square both sides of this, of this equation, if you were to square both sides of this equation, what do you get? Well negative, anything negative squared becomes a positive."
Math,"And then the square root of nine squared, well, that's just going to be nine. And on the right-hand side, negative three squared, well, negative three times negative three is positive nine. So, it all works out. Nine is equal, nine is equal to nine. And so this is an interesting thing, actually. Let me write this a little bit more algebraically now. If we were to write, if we were to write the principal root of nine is equal to x."
Math,"This is, there's only one possible x here that satisfies it, because the standard convention, what most mathematicians have agreed to view this radical symbol as, is that this is a principal square root, this is the positive square root, so there's only one x here. There's only one x that would satisfy this, and that is x is equal to three. Now, if I were to write x squared is equal to nine, now, this is slightly different. X equals three definitely satisfies this."
Math,"This could be x equals three, but the other thing, the other x that satisfies this is x could also be equal to negative three, 'cause negative three squared is also equal to nine. So, these two things, these two statements, are almost equivalent, although when you're looking at this one, there's two x's that satisfy this one, while there's only one x that satisfies this one, because this is a positive square root."
Math,"If people wanted to write something equivalent where you would have two x's that could satisfy it, you might see something like this. Plus or minus square root of nine is equal to x, and now x could take on positive three or negative three.."
Math,"In fact, we could write it like this. We could write the square root of 49, so this is whatever number times itself is equal to 49. If I multiply that number times itself, if I square it, well I'm going to get 49. And that's going to be true for any number, not just 49. If I write the square root of X and if I were to square it, that's going to be equal to X and that's going to be true for any X for which we can evaluate the square root, evaluate the principle root."
Math,"Now typically and as you advance in math you're going to see that this will change, but typically you say, okay if I'm going to take the square root of something, X has to be non-negative. X has to be non-negative."
Math,"This is going to change once we start thinking about imaginary and complex numbers, but typically for the principle square root, we assume that whatever's under the radical, whatever's under here, is going to be non-negative because it's hard to square a number at least the numbers that we know about, it's hard to square them and get a negative number. So for this thing to be defined, for it to make sense, it's typical to say that, okay we need to put a non-negative number in here."
Math,"But anyway, the focus of this video is not on the square root, it's really just to review things so we can start thinking about the cube root. And as you can imagine, where does the whole notion of taking a square of something or a square root come from? Well it comes from the notion of finding the area of a square. If I have a square like this and if this side is seven, well if it's a square, all the sides are going to be seven."
Math,"And if I wanted to find the area of this, it would be seven times seven or seven squared. That would be the area of this. Or if I were to say, well what is if I have a square, if I have, and that doesn't look like a perfect square, but you get the idea, all the sides are the same length. If I have a square with area X. If the area here is X, what are the lengths of the sides going to be? Well it's going to be square root of X."
Math,"All of the sides are going to be the square root of X, so it's going to be the square root of X by the square root of X and this side is going to be the square root of X as well and that's going to be the square root of X as well. So that's where the term square root comes from, where the square comes from. Now what do you think cube root? Well same idea. If I have a cube. If I have a cube. Let me do my best attempt at drawing a cube really fast."
Math,"If I have a cube and a cube, all of it's dimensions have the same length so this is a two, by two, by two cube, what's the volume over here. Well the volume is going to be two, times two, times two, which is two to the third power or two cubed. This is two cubed. That's why they use the word cubed because this would be the volume of a cube where each of its sides have length two and this of course is going to be equal to eight."
Math,"But what if we went the other way around? What if we started with the cube? What if we started with this volume? What if we started with a cube's volume and let's say the volume here is eight cubic units, so volume is equal to eight and we wanted to find the lengths of the sides. So we wanted to figure out what X is cause that's X, that's X, and that's X. It's a cube so all the dimensions have the same length. Well there's two ways that we could express this."
Math,"We could say that X times X times X or X to the third power is equal to eight or we could use the cube root symbol, which is a radical with a little three in the right place. Or we could write that X is equal to, it's going to look very similar to the square root. This would be the square root of eight, but to make it clear, they were talking about the cube root of eight, we would write a little three over there. In theory for square root, you could put a little two over here, but that'd be redundant."
Math,"If there's no number here, people just assume that it's the square root. But if you're figuring out the cube root or sometimes you say the third root, well then you have to say, well you have to put this little three right over here in this little notch in the radical symbol right over here. And so this is saying X is going to be some number that if I cube it, I get eight. So with that out of the way, let's do some examples. Let's say that I have... Let's say that I want to calculate the cube root of 27."
Math,"What's that going to be? Well if say that this is going to be equal to X, this is equivalent to saying that X to the third or that 27 is equal to X to the third power. So what is X going to be? Well X times X times X is equal to 27, well the number I can think of is three, so we would say that X, let me scroll down a little bit, X is equal to three. Now let me ask you a question. Can we write something like... Can we pick a new color? The cube root of, let me write negative 64."
Math,"I already talked about that if we're talking the square root, it's fairly typical that hey you put a negative number in there at least until we learn about imaginary numbers, we don't know what to do with it. But can we do something with this? Well if I cube something, can I get a negative number? So if I say this is equal to X, this is the same thing as saying that negative 64 is equal to X to the third power."
Math,"Well what could X be? Well what happens if you take negative four times negative four times negative four? Negative four times four is positive 16, but then times negative four is negative 64 is equal to negative 64. So what could X be here? Well X could be equal to negative four. X could be equal to negative four. So based on the math that we know so far you actually can take the cube root of a negative number. And just so you know, you don't have to stop there."
Math,"You could take a fourth root and in this case you'd have a four here, a fifth root, a sixth root, a seventh root of numbers and we'll talk about that later in your mathematical career. But most of what you're going to see is actually going to be square root and every now and then you're going to see a cube root."
Math,"Now you might be saying, well hey look, you know, you just knew that three to the third power is 27, you took the cube root, you get X, is there any simple way to do this? And like you know if i give you an arbitrary number. If I were to just say, I don't know, if I were to say cube root of 125. And the simple answer is, well the easiest way to actually figure this out is actually just to do a factorization and particular prime factorization of this thing right over here and then you would figure it out."
Math,"So you would say, okay well 125 is five times 25, which is five times five. Alright, so this is the same thing as the cube root of five to the third power, which of course, is going to be equal to five. If you have a much larger number here, yes, there's no very simple way to compute what a cube root or a fourth root or a fifth root might be and even square root can get quite difficult. There's no very simple way to just calculate it the way that you might multiply things or divide it.."
Math,"And before we do a prime factorization of it to see which of these factors show up at least three times, let's at least think about the negative part a little bit. So negative 512, that's the same thing-- so let me rewrite the expression-- this is the same thing as the cube root of negative 1 times 512, which is the same thing as the cube root of negative 1 times the cube root of 512. And this one's pretty straightforward to answer."
Math,"What number, when I raise it to the third power, do I get negative 1? Well, I get negative 1. This right here is negative 1. Negative 1 to the third power is equal to negative 1 times negative 1 times negative 1, which is equal to negative 1. So the cube root of negative 1 is negative 1. So it becomes negative 1 times this business right here, times the cube root of 512. And let's think what this might be. So let's do the prime factorization. So 512 is 2 times 256. 256 is 2 times 128. 128 is 2 times 64."
Math,"We already see a 2 three times. 64 is 2 times 32. 32 is 2 times 16. We're getting a lot of twos here. 16 is 2 times 8. 8 is 2 times 4. And 4 is 2 times 2. So we got a lot of twos. So essentially, if you multiply 2 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine times, you're going to get 512, or 2 to the ninth power is 512. And that by itself should give you a clue of what the cube root is. But another way to think about it is, can we find-- there's definitely three twos here."
Math,"But can we find three groups of twos, or we could also find-- let me look at it this way. We can find three groups of two twos over here. So that's 2 times 2 is 4. 2 times 2 is 4. So definitely 4 multiplied by itself three times is divisible into this. But even better, it looks like we can get three groups of three twos. So one group, two groups, and three groups. So each of these groups, 2 times 2 times 2, that's 8. That is 8. This is 2 times 2 times 2. That's 8. And this is also 2 times 2 times 2."
Math,"So that's 8. So we could write 512 as being equal to 8 times 8 times 8. And so we can rewrite this expression right over here as the cube root of 8 times 8 times 8. So this is equal to negative 1, or I could just put a negative sign here, negative 1 times the cube root of 8 times 8 times 8. So we're asking our question. What number can we multiply by itself three times, or to the third power, to get 512, which is the same thing as 8 times 8 times 8? Well, clearly this is 8."
Math,"So the answer, this part right over here, is just going to simplify to 8. And so our answer to this, the cube root of negative 512, is negative 8. And we are done. And you could verify this. Multiply negative 8 times itself three times. Well, let's just do it. Negative 8 times negative 8 times negative 8. Negative 8 times negative 8 is positive 64. You multiply that times negative 8, you get negative 512.."
Math,"another way of expressing this is, that well, that means that P is going to be equal to the positive or negative square root of 0.81. Remember if we just wrote the square root symbol here, that means the principal root, or just the positive square root. But here P could be positive or negative, because if you square it, if you square even a negative number, you're still going to get a positive value."
Math,"So we could write that P is equal to the plus or minus square root of 0.81, which kind of helps us, it's another way of expressing the same, the same, equation. But still, what could P be? In your brain, you might immediately say, well okay, you know if this was P squared is equal to 81, I kinda know what's going on. Because I know that nine times nine is equal to 81. Or we could write that nine squared is equal to 81, or we could write that nine is equal to the principal root of 81."
Math,"These are all, I guess, saying the same truth about the universe, but what about 0.81? Well 0.81 has two digits behind, to the right of the decimal and so if I were to multiply something that has one digit to the right of the decimal times itself, I'm gonna have something with two digits to the right of the decimal. And so what happens if I take, instead of nine squared, what happens if I take 0.9 squared? Let me try that out. Zero, I'm gonna use a different color. So let's say I took 0.9 squared."
Math,"0.9 squared, well that's going to be 0.9 times 0.9, which is going to be equal to? Well nine times nine is 81, and I have one, two, numbers to the right of the decimal, so I'm gonna have two numbers to the right of the decimal in the product. So one, two. So that indeed is equal to 0.81. In fact we could write 0.81 as 0.9 squared. So we could write this, we could write that P is equal to the plus or minus, the square root of, instead of writing 0.81, I could write that as 0.9 squared."
Math,"In fact I could also write that as negative 0.9 squared. Cause if you put a negative here and a negative here, it's still not going to change the value. A negative times a negative is going to be a positive. I could, actually I would have put a negative there, which would have implied a negative here and a negative there. So either of those are going to be true. But it's going to work out for us because we are taking the positive and negative square root."
Math,"So this is going to be, P is going to be equal to plus or minus 0.9. Plus or minus 0.9, or we could write it that P is equal to 0.9, or P could be equal to negative 0.9. And you can verify that, you would square either of these things, you get 0.81.."
Math,"Well let's call this length x. If that's x then this is going to be x, and then this is x as well. So if the volume is 512 cubic centimeters, that means that x times x times x is going to be equal to 512. Is going to be equal to 512, or we could say that x to the third power is equal to 512, or we could say that x is equal to the cube root of 512."
Math,"So what's the cube root of 512? And the easiest way I can think about doing this, if I don't have a calculator, is to just try to do a prime factorization of this by hand. So that's what I'm going to attempt to do. So let's see, does two go into 512? Sure, 512s even, so this is going to be two times, let's see, 256, yeah, two times 256. 256 that's also divisible by two. That's two times 128, which is also divisible by two, that's two time 64, which is also divisible by two."
Math,"That's two times 32, let's see, I can keep going, that's two times 16. Which is two times eight, which is two times four, which is two times two. So 512 that's the same thing as two to the, let's see you have, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. That's two to the ninth power."
Math,"But what we care about is what times itself times itself is equal, what number, if I have three of 'em and I multiply 'em together, get us to 512? And to think about that, we could say, ""Look, I have nine numbers here."
Math,"""So let me divide into three groups."" So if this is one group, and this is the next group, and then this is the next group right over here, we could say that 512 is the same thing as two times two times two, which is eight, times two times two times two, which is eight, times two times two times two. So 512 is the same thing as eight to the third power."
Math,"So we could say, that, x, I'll do it over here, x is equal to the cube root of, instead of writing 512, instead of writing 512, I could write eight to the third power. Now, what's the cube root of something to the third power? Well, it's just gonna be this something. So x, x is going to be equal to eight. So if the volume here is 512 cubic centimeters, each dimension is going to be eight centimeters. So x is equal to eight centimeters. This is equal to eight centimeters. I'm just writing the units now."
Math,"This is equal to eight centimeters, and we're done. But, if you didn't know offhand that eight to the third power is 512, this is a reasonable way of coming to that conclusion. Anyway, hopefully that helped.."
Math,"So we have the square root of 8 over 2. If you take the square root of a number that is not a perfect square, it is going to be irrational. And then if you just take that irrational number and you multiply it, and you divide it by any other numbers, you're still going to get an irrational number. So square root of 8 is irrational. You divide that by 2, it is still irrational. So this is not rational. Or in other words, I'm saying it is irrational."
Math,"Now, you have pi, 3.14159-- it just keeps going on and on and on forever without ever repeating. So this is irrational, probably the most famous of all of the irrational numbers. 5.0-- well, I can represent 5.0 as 5/1. So 5.0 is rational. It is not irrational. 0.325-- well, this is the same thing as 325/1000. So I can clearly represent it as a ratio of integers. So this is rational. Just as I could represent 5.0 as 5/1, both of these are rational. They are not irrational."
Math,"Here I have 7.777777, and it just keeps going on and on and on forever. And the way we denote that, you could just say these dots that say that the 7's keep going. Or you could say 7.7. And this line shows that the 7 part, the second 7, just keeps repeating on forever. Now, if you have a repeating decimal-- in other videos, we'll actually convert them into fractions-- but a repeating decimal can be represented as a ratio of two integers. Just as 1/3 is equal to 0.333 on and on and on."
Math,"Or I could say it like this. I could say 3 repeating. We can also do the same thing for that. I won't do it here, but this is rational. So it's not irrational. 8 and 1/2? Well, that's the same thing. 8 and 1/2 is the same thing as 17/2. So it's clearly rational. So the only two irrational numbers are the first two right over here.."
Math,"These things can be represented as a fraction of two integers, we call these rational numbers. Rational numbers. And if something cannot be represented as a fraction of two integers, we call irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. And the size of these circles don't show how large these sets are. There's actually an infinite number of rational and an infinite number of irrational numbers. So, these are the irrational numbers. Irrational."
Math,"So, these cannot be represented as a fraction of two integers. And then, within rational numbers, you have integers themselves. So, I'll do that in, let me do that in this blue color. Integers. So, integers are numbers that don't have to be represented as a fraction or a decimal. So, these are integers, right over here. Integers. And then a subset of integers are whole numbers. So, if you essentially say the non-negative integers, you're then talking about whole numbers."
Math,"So let me do that subset, right over here. So, these are going to be the whole numbers. So, whole numbers. Whole numbers, right over here. And, actually, let me just label it all. These are rational... Let me do that in the same color. Rational numbers. And, of course, irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. An integer. Well, if I could say, ""Look, that is an integer."
Math,"""Let's think about the integers."" But I wouldn't say, ""Let's just think about the rational."" I'd say, ""Let's think about the rational numbers."" All right, now that we have these categories in place, let's categorize them. Like always, pause the video. See if you can figure out what category these numbers fall into. Where would you put them on this diagram? So, let's start off with three. This is positive three. It can be definitely represented as a fraction. You can represent it as three over one."
Math,"But, it doesn't have to be represented as a fraction. It, literally, could be just a three, right over there, but it's also non-negative. So three is a whole number. So three, and maybe I'll do it in the color of the category. So, three is a whole number. So, it's a member of that set. But if you're a whole number, you're also an integer, and you're also a rational number. So, three is a whole number, it's an integer, and it's a rational number. Now, let's think about negative five."
Math,"Now, negative five, once again, it can be represented as a fraction, but it doesn't have to be, but it is negative. So, it's not gonna be a whole number. So, negative five is going to sit right over here. It's an integer, and if you're an integer, you're definitely going to be a rational number, but it's not a whole number because it is negative. Now we have 0.25. Well, this, for sure, can be represented as a fraction. This is 25-hundredths, right over here."
Math,"So, we can represent that as a fraction of two integers, I should say. It's 25-hundredths. But there's no way to represent this except using a fraction of two integers. So, 0.25 is a rational number, but it's not an integer and not a whole number. Now what about 22 over seven. Well, here it's clearly represented, already, as a fraction of two integers, but I don't think I can represent this any other, except as a fraction of two integers."
Math,"I can't somehow make this without using a fraction or some type of decimal that might repeat. So, this, right over here, this would also be a rational number, but it's not an integer, not a whole number. Now this over here. 0.2713. Now the 13 repeats. This is the same thing as 0.27131313, that's what line up there represents."
Math,"Now, you might not realize it yet, but any number that repeats eventually, this one does repeat eventually, you have the .1313, or you have the 0.27131313, any number like this can be represented as a fraction. For example, and I'm not going to do it here, just for the sake of time, but, for example, 0.3, repeating, that's the same thing as one-third. And later on, we're gonna see techniques of how do you convert this to a fraction of two integers."
Math,"But, for our sake, we just know that this can be represented as a fraction of two integers just the way that 0.3, repeating, can be. And so, we would put this under rational numbers. 0.2713, repeating. But you have to represent it either as a decimal or a fraction of integers. If you didn't have to, then it could have been an integer, but we'll throw it up there in rational numbers. Now the square root of ten. Square root of ten. This is interesting."
Math,"So, any square root of a non-perfect square is going to be irrational. So, this is gonna be irrational. I'm not proving it to you here, but you cannot represent this as the ratio of two integers, or a fraction with two integers, with an integer in the numerator and an integer in the denominator. This will be, if you were to represent it as a decimal, it will not repeat. It'll just keep being new and new digits. It will not repeat over time. So, this, right over here, is an irrational number."
Math,"It's not rational. It cannot be represented as the ratio of two integers. All right, 14 over seven. This is the ratio of two integers. So, this, for sure, is rational. But if you think about it, 14 over seven, that's another way of saying, 14 over seven is the same thing as two. These two things are equivalent. So, 14 over seven is the same thing as two. So, this is actually a whole number."
Math,"It doesn't look like a whole number, but, remember, a whole number is a non-negative number that doesn't need to be represented as the ratio of two integers. And this one, even though we did represent it as the ratio of two integers, it doesn't need to be represented as the ratio of two integers. You could have represent this as just two. So, that's going to be a whole number. 14 over seven, which is the same thing as two, that is a whole number. Now, two-pi. Now pi is an irrational..."
Math,"Pi is an irrational number. So if we just take a multiple of pi, if we just take a integer multiple of pi, like that, this is also going to be an irrational number. If you looked at its decimal representation, it will never repeat. So that's two-pi, right over there. Now what about... Let me do that same, since I've been consistent, relatively consistent, with the colors. So, this is two-pi right over there. Now, what about the negative square root of 25. Well, 25's a perfect square."
Math,"Square root of that's just gonna be five. So, this thing is going to be, this thing is going to be equivalent to negative five. So, this is just another representation of this, right over here. So, it is an integer. It's not a whole number because it's negative, but it's an integer. Negative square root of 25. These two things are actually... These two things are actually the same number, just different ways of representing them. And then you have, let's see, you have the square root of nine over..."
Math,"The square root of nine over seven. Well, what's the principal root of nine? This thing is gonna be the same thing, this thing is the same... Let me do this in a different color. This is the same thing as, square root of nine is three, it's the principal root of nine, so it's three-sevenths. So, this is a ratio of two integers. This is a rational number. Square root of nine over seven is the same thing as three-sevenths. Now, let me just give you one more just for the road."
Math,"What about pi over pi? What is that going to be? Well, pi divided by pi is going to be equal to one. So, this is actually a whole number. So I could write pi over pi, right over there. That's just a very fancy way of saying one.."
Math,"So this line on top means that the 28 just keep repeating forever. So I could express this number as 3.4028, but the 28 just keep repeating. Just keep repeating on and on and on forever. I could just keep writing them forever and ever. And obviously, it's just easier to write this line over the 28 to say that it repeats forever. Now let's think about what number sets it belongs to. Well, the broadest number set we've dealt with so far is the real numbers. And this definitely belongs to the real numbers."
Math,"The real numbers is essentially the entire number line that we're used to using. And 3.4028 repeating sits someplace over here. If this is negative 1, this is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 3.4028 is a little bit more than 3.4, a little bit less than 3.41. It would sit right over there. So it definitely sits on the number line. It's a real number. So it definitely is real. It definitely is a real number. But the not so obvious question is whether it is a rational number."
Math,"Remember, a rational number is one that can be expressed as a rational expression or as a fraction. If I were to tell you that p is rational, that means that p can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. That means that p can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, m/n. So the question is, can I express this as the ratio of two integers? Or another way to think of it, can I express this as a fraction? And to do that, let's actually express it as a fraction."
Math,"Let's define x as being equal to this number. So x is equal to 3.4028 repeating. Let's think about what 10,000x is. And the only reason why I want 10,000x is because I want to move the decimal point all the way to the right over here. So 10,000x. What is that going to be equal to? Well every time you multiply by a power of 10, you shift the decimal one to the right. 10,000 is 10 to the fourth power. So it's like shifting the decimal over to the right four spaces. 1, 2, 3, 4. So it'll be 34,028."
Math,"But these 28's just keep repeating. So you'll still have the 28's go on and on, and on and on, and on after that. They just all got shifted to the left of the decimal point by five spaces. You can view it that way. That makes sense. It's nearly 3 and 1/2. If you multiply by 10,000, you get almost 35,000. So that's 10,000x. Now, let's also think about 100x. And my whole exercise here is I want to get two numbers that, when I subtract them and they're in terms of x, the repeating part disappears."
Math,"And then we can just treat them as traditional numbers. So let's think about what 100x is. That moves this decimal point. Remember, the decimal point was here originally. It moves it over to the right two spaces. So 100x would be 300-- Let me write it like this. It would be 340.28 repeating. We could have put the 28 repeating here, but it wouldn't have made as much sense. You always want to write it after the decimal point. So we have to write 28 again to show that it is repeating."
Math,"Now something interesting is going on. These two numbers, they're just multiples of x. And if I subtract the bottom one from the top one, what's going to happen? Well the repeating part is going to disappear. So let's do that. Let's do that on both sides of this equation. Let's do it. So on the left-hand side of this equation, 10,000x minus 100x is going to be 9,900x. And on the right-hand side, let's see-- The decimal part will cancel out. And we just have to figure out what 34,028 minus 340 is."
Math,"So let's just figure this out. 8 is larger than 0, so we won't have to do any regrouping there. 2 is less than 4. So we will have to do some regrouping, but we can't borrow yet because we have a 0 over there. And 0 is less than 3, so we have to do some regrouping there or some borrowing. So let's borrow from the 4 first. So if we borrow from the 4, this becomes a 3 and then this becomes a 10. And then the 2 can now borrow from the 10. This becomes a 9 and this becomes a 12."
Math,"And now we can do the subtraction. 8 minus 0 is 8. 12 minus 4 is 8. 9 minus 3 is 6. 3 minus nothing is 3. 3 minus nothing is 3. So 9,900x is equal to 33,688. We just subtracted 340 from this up here. So we get 33,688. Now, if we want to solve for x, we just divide both sides by 9,900. Divide the left by 9,900. Divide the right by 9,900. And then, what are we left with? We're left with x is equal to 33,688 over 9,900. Now what's the big deal about this? Well, x was this number."
Math,"x was this number that we started off with, this number that just kept on repeating. And by doing a little bit of algebraic manipulation and subtracting one multiple of it from another, we're able to express that same exact x as a fraction. Now this isn't in simplest terms. I mean they're both definitely divisible by 2 and it looks like by 4. So you could put this in lowest common form, but we don't care about that."
Math,"All we care about is the fact that we were able to represent x, we were able to represent this number, as a fraction. As the ratio of two integers. So the number is also rational. It is also rational. And this technique we did, it doesn't only apply to this number. Any time you have a number that has repeating digits, you could do this. So in general, repeating digits are rational. The ones that are irrational are the ones that never, ever, ever repeat, like pi."
Math,"And so the other things, I think it's pretty obvious, this isn't an integer. The integers are the whole numbers that we're dealing with. So this is someplace in between the integers. It's not a natural number or a whole number, which depending on the context are viewed as subsets of integers. So it's definitely none of those. So it is real and it is rational. That's all we can say about it.."
Math,"So 32, what's the perfect square below 32? So the greatest perfect square below 32 is 25. 32 is greater than 25. That's five squared. So maybe I should write it this way. So five squared is less than 32 and then 32, what's the next perfect square after 32? Well 32 is less than 36. So we could say 32 is less than six squared."
Math,"So if you were to take the square root of all of these sides right over here, we could say that instead of here we have all of the values squared, but instead, if we took the square root, we could say five is going to be less than the square root of 32, which is less than, which is less than six. Notice, to go from here to here, to go from here to here, and here to here, all we did is we squared things, we raised everything to the second power. But the inequality should still hold."
Math,"So the square root of 32 should be between five and six. It's going to be five point something. Let's do another example. Let's say we wanted to estimate, we want to say between what two integers is the square root of 55? Well we can do the same idea. Let's square it. So if we square the square root of 55, we're just gonna get to 55."
Math,"We're just going to get, let me do that in the same color, So okay, 55 is between which two perfect squares? So the perfect square that is below 55, or I could say the greatest perfect square that is less than 55. Let's see, six squared is 36 and seven squared is 49, eight squared is 64. So it would be 49. I could write that as seven squared. Let me write that, that is the same thing as seven squared. And what's the next perfect square above it? Well we just figured it out."
Math,"Seven squared is 49, eight squared is larger than 55, it's 64. So this is going to be less than 64, which is eight squared. And of course 55, just to make it clear what's going on. 55 is the square root of 55 squared. That's kind of by definition, it's going to be the square root of 55 squared. And so the square root of 55 is going to be between what? It's going to be between seven and eight. So seven is less than the square root of 55, which is less than eight."
Math,"So once again, this is just an interesting way to think about, what would you, if someone said the square root of 55 and at first you're like, ""Oh, uh, I don't know what that is. ""I don't have a calculator,"" et cetera et cetera. You're like, ""Oh wait, wait, that's going to be between ""49 and 64, so it's going to be seven point something."" It's going to be seven point something. And you can even get a rough estimate of seven point what based on how far away it is from 49 and 64."
Math,"You can begin to approximate things. Let's do one more example. Let's say we wanted to figure out where does the square root of 123 lie? And like always, I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it yourself. Between what two integers does this lie? Well, if we were to square it, you get to 123. And what's the perfect square that is the greatest perfect square less than 123? Let's see, 10 squared is 100. 11 squared is 121. 12 squared is 144. So 11 squared."
Math,"So 123, so we could write 121 is less than 123, which is less than 144, that's 12 squared. So if we take the square roots we could write that 11 is less than the square root of 123, which is less than 144. So once again, what's the square root of 123? It's going to be 11 point something. And in fact, it's going to be closer to 11 than it's going to be to 12. 123 is a lot closer to 121 than it is to 144. So it might be, I don't know, 11.1, something like that."
Math,"I don't know if that's exactly right, we would have to check that on the calculator. But hopefully this gives you, oops I, that actually will be less than 144. But if we want to think about what consecutive integers is that be between, it's going to be a 12 right over there. Almost made a... Well anyway, you get the idea. Hopefully you enjoyed that.."
Math,"And like always, pause this video and see if you can do that. So I'll give you a hint. The hint is-- it's very hard without a calculator. Square root of two is gonna be one point something, something. Square root of three is gonna be one point something, something. How do we do this? We just have to realize that, if I have some number, let's say I have some number a that is greater than 0. And if we know that a is less than b, then a squared is going to be less than b squared."
Math,"If one positive number is less than another positive number, then the square of this positive number is going to be less than the square of that number. So one thing that we could do when we are comparing all of these irrational numbers that involve square roots of non-perfect squares, let's compare their squares. Because their squares are not going to be irrational numbers. It's going to be much easier to compare, and then we can order them."
Math,"Because if we order the squares, then they'll tell us what happens if we order their square roots. What am I talking about? Well, I'm just gonna square each of these. So if I take this to the second power, this is going to be four square roots of two, times four square roots of two. You can change the order of multiplication. That's four times four times the square root of two times the square root of two. Now, four times four is 16."
Math,"Square root of two times square root of two, well, that's just going to be two. So it's gonna be 16 times two which is equal to 32. Now what about two square roots of three? Well, same idea. Let's square it, let's square it. And i'll do this one a little bit faster. So if we square two square roots of three, this is going to be two squared times square root of three squared. So it's going to be two squared times the square root of three squared. Well, two squared is going to be four."
Math,"Square root of three squared is going to be three. So this is going to be equal to 12. That's this thing squared. If this step seems a little bit confusing, if you have the product of two things raised to a power, that's the same thing as raising each of them to that power, and then taking the product. And you can actually see, I worked it out here, why that actually makes sense."
Math,"Notice when I just changed the order of multiplication you had four times four, or four squared, times square root of two squared, which is going to be two. So let's keep doing that. So what is this value squared? It's gonna be three squared, which is nine, times square root of two squared, which is two. Nine times two is 18. What's the square root of 17 squared? That's just going to be seventeen. Do that in blue. This is just going to be 17."
Math,"What is three square roots of three squared? It's gonna be three squared, which is nine, times square root of three squared. The square root of three times the square root of three is three. So it's gonna be nine times three, or 27. And what is five squared? This is pretty straightforward. That's going to be 25. So let's order them from least to greatest. Which of them, when I square it, gives me the smallest value? Compare 32 to 12 to 18 to 17 to 27 to 25. 12 is the smallest value."
Math,"So if their square is the smallest, and these are all positive numbers, then this is going to be the smallest value out of all of them. Let me write that first. Two square roots of three. So I've covered that one. Now what's next? Well, now I have this value. 17 is the next smallest square, so its square root is going to be the next square root. So it's going to be two square roots of three, then square root of 17. That is this one here. Then we go to 18."
Math,"So if we look at its square root, with the numbers we were originally trying to sort, that would be three square roots of two, three square roots of two, We got that one covered. Then the next one is gonna be 25, when we look at the squares. So the next value out of our original set, the next largest one, is going to be five. So then we get to five, we've covered that one. Then the next one, let's see. We have 27 and 32 left."
Math,"27 is the next largest square, so the next largest number out of the ones we care about, is three square roots of three. So three square roots of three, we covered that one. And then we finish with-- This is the largest value, four square roots of two. Four square roots of two. And we're done! That was pretty neat. Without a calculator, we were able to sort these irrational numbers, well, not all of them are irrational, but ones that involve the square root of something that is not a perfect square.."
Math,"So, let's see if we can approximate this just with our pen and paper right over here. So the square root of 45, or the principal root of 45. 45 is not a perfect square. It's definitely not a perfect square. Let's see, what are the perfect squares around it? We know that it is going to be less than-- the next perfect square above 45 is going to be 49 because that is 7 times 7-- so it's less than the square root of 49 and it's greater than the square root of 36."
Math,"And so, the square root of 36, the principal root of 36 I should say, is 6. And the principal root of 49 is 7. So, this value right over here is going to be between 6 and 7. And if we look at it, it's only four away from 49. And it's nine away from 36. So, the different between 36 and 49 is 13. So, it's a total 13 gap between the 6 squared and 7 squared. And this is nine of the way through it."
Math,"So, just as a kind of approximation maybe-- and it's not going to work out perfectly because we're squaring it, this isn't a linear relationship-- but it's going to be closer to 7 than it's going to be to 6. At least the 45 is 9/13 of the way. Let's see. It looks like that's about 2/3 of the way. So, let's try 6.7 as a guess just based on 0.7 is about 2/3. It looks like about the same. Actually, we could calculate this right here if we want. Actually, let's do that just for fun."
Math,"So 9/13 as a decimal is going to be what? It's going to be 13 into 9. We're going to put some decimal places right over here. 13 doesn't go into 9 but 13 does go into 90. And it goes into 90-- let's see, does it go into it seven times-- it goes into it six times. So, 6 times 3 is 18. 6 times 1 is 6, plus 1 is 7. And then you subtract, you get 12. So, went into it almost exactly seven times. So, this value right here is almost a 0.7."
Math,"And so if you say, how many times does 13 go into 120? It looks like it's like nine times? Yeah, it would go into it nine times. 9 times 3. Get rid of this. 9 times 3 is 27. 9 times 1 is 9, plus 2 is 11. You have a remainder of 3. It's about 0.69. So 6.7 would be a pretty good guess. This is 0.69 of the way between 36 and 49. So, let's go roughly 0.69 of the way between 6 and 7. So this is once again just to approximate. It's not necessarily going to give us the exact answer."
Math,"We have to use that to make a good initial guess. And then see how it works. Let's try 6.7. And the really way to try it is to square 6.7. So 6.7 times-- maybe I'll write the multiplication symbol there-- 6.7 times 6.7. So, we have 7 times 7 is 49. 7 times 6 is 42, plus 4 is 46. Put a 0 now because we've moved a space to the left. So, now we have 6 times 7 is 42. Carry the 4. 6 times 6 is 36, plus 4 is 40. And so, 9 plus 0 is 9. 6 plus 2 is 8. 4 plus 0 is 4. And then we have a 4 right over here."
Math,"And we have two total numbers behind the decimal point. One, two. So this gives us 44.89. So, 6.7 gets us pretty close. But we're still not probably right to the hundredth. Well, we're definitely not to the hundredths place. This since we've only gone to the tenths place right over here. So, if we want to get to 45, 6.7 squared is still less than 45, or 6.7 is still less than the square root of 45. So let's try 6.71. Let me do this in a new color. I'll do 6.71 in pink. So, let's try 6.71."
Math,"Increase it a little bit. See if we go from 44.89 to 45. Because this is really close already. Let's just try it out. So once again, we have to do some arithmetic by hand. We are assuming that they don't want us to use a calculator here. So, we have 1 times 1 is 1. 1 times 7 is 7. 1 times 6 is 6. Put a 0 here. 7 times 1 is 7. 7 times 7 is 49. 7 times 6 is 42, plus 4 is 46. And then we have two 0s here. 6 times 1 is 6. 6 times 7 is 42. Just have this new 4 here. 6 times 6 is 36, plus 4 is 40. Plus 40."
Math,"It's interesting to think what we got incrementally by adding that one hundredth over there. Well, we'll see actually when we add all of this up. You get a 1. 7 plus 7 is 14. 1 plus 6 plus 9 is 16, plus 6 is 22. 2 plus 6 plus 2 is 10. And then 1 plus 4 is 5. And then we bring down the 4. And we have one, two, three, four numbers behind the decimal point. One, two, three, four. So, when you we squared 6.71. 6.71 squared is equal to 45.0241. So 6.71 is a little bit greater. So, let me make it clear now."
Math,"We know that 6.7 is less than the square root of 45. And we know that is less than 6.71. Because when we square this, we get something a little bit over the square root of 45. But the key here is when we square this, so 6.7 squared got us 44.89 which is 0.11 away from 45. And then, if we look at 6.71 squared, we're only 2.4 hundredths above 45. So, this right here is closer to the square root of 45. So if we approximate to the hundredths place, definitely want to go with 6.71.."
Math,"Well that literally means just taking a -3. And there's nothing left to multiply it with. So this is just going to be equal to -3. Now what happens if you were take a -3, and we were to raise it to the 2nd power? Well that's equivalent to taking 2 -3's, so a -3 and a -3, and then multiplying them together. What's that going to be? Well a negative times a negative is a positive. So that is going to be positive 9. Let me write this. It's going to be positive 9. Well, let's keep going."
Math,"Let's see if there is some type of pattern here. Let's take -3 and raise it to the 3rd power. What is this going to be equal to? Well, we're going to take 3 -3's, [WRITING] – and we're going to multiply them together. So we're going to multiply them together. -3 × -3, we already figured out is positive 9. But positive 9 × -3, well that's that's -27. And so you might notice a pattern here."
Math,"Whenever we raised raised a negative base to an exponent, if we raise it to an odd exponent, we are going to get a negative value. And that's because when you multiply negative numbers an even number of times, a negative number times a negative number is a positive. But then you have one more negative number to multiply the result by – which makes it negative."
Math,"And if you take a negative base, and you raise it to an even power, that's because if you multiply a negative times a negative, you're going to get a positive. And so when you do it an even number of times, doing it a multiple-of-two number of times. So the negatives and the negatives all cancel out, I guess you could say. Or when you take the product of the two negatives, you keep getting positives. So this right over here is going to give you a positive value."
Math,"So there's really nothing new about taking powers of negative numbers. It's really the same idea. And you just really have to remember that a negative times a negative is a positive. And a negative times a positive is a negative, which we already learned from multiplying negative numbers. Now there's one other thing that I want to clarify – because sometimes there might be ambiguity if someone writes this. Let's say someone writes that."
Math,"And I encourage you to actually pause the video and think about with this right over here would evaluate to. And, if you given a go at that, think about whether this should mean something different then that. Well this one can be a little bit and big ambiguous and if people are strict about order of operations, you should really be thinking about the exponent before you multiply by this -1. You could this is implicitly saying -1 × 2^3."
Math,"So many times, this will usually be interpreted as negative 2 to the third power, which is equal to -8, while this is going to be interpreted as -2 to the third power. Now that also is equal to -8. You might say well what's what's the big deal here? Well what if this was what if these were even exponents. So what if someone had give myself some more space here. What if someone had these to express its -4 or a -4 squared or -4 squared. This one clearly evaluates to 16 – positive 16."
Math,"It's a negative 4 times a *4. This one could be interpreted as is. Especially if you look at order of operations, and you do your exponent first, this would be interpreted as -4 times 4, which would be -16. So it's really important to think about this properly. And if you want to write the number negative if you want the base to be negative 4, put parentheses around it and then write the exponent.."
Math,"So what's this going to be? Well, let's see. Negative 2 times negative 2 is positive 4, and then positive 4 times negative 2 is negative 8. So this would be equal to negative 8. Now, another way of thinking about exponents, instead of saying you're just taking three negative 2's and multiplying them, and this is a completely reasonable way of viewing it, you could also view it as this is a number of times you're going to multiply this number times 1."
Math,"So you could completely view this as being equal to-- so you're going to start with a 1, and you're going to multiply 1 times negative 2 three times. So this is times negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2. So clearly these are the same number. Here we just took this, and we're just multiplying it by 1, so you're still going to get negative 8. And this might be a slightly more useful idea to get an intuition for exponents, especially when you start taking things to the 1 or 0 power."
Math,"So let's think about that a little bit. What is positive 2 to the-- based on this definition-- to the 0 power going to be equal to? Well, we just said. This says how many times are going to multiply 1 times this number? So this literally says, I'm going to take a 1, and I'm going to multiply by 2 zero times. Well, if I want to multiply it by 2 zero times, that means I'm just left with the 1. So 2 to the zero power is going to be equal to 1."
Math,"And, actually, any non-zero number to the 0 power is 1 by that same rationale. And I'll make another video that will also give a little bit more intuition on there. That might seem very counterintuitive, but it's based on one way of thinking about it is thinking of an exponent as this. And this will also make sense if we start thinking of what 2 to the first power is. So let's go to this definition we just gave of the exponent. We always start with a 1, and we multiply it by the 2 one time."
Math,"So 2 is going to be 1-- we're only going to multiply it by the 2. I'll use this for multiplication. I'll use the dot. We're only going to multiply it by 2 one time. So 1 times 2, well, that's clearly just going to be equal to 2. And any number to the first power is just going to be equal to that number. And then we can go from there, and you will, of course, see the pattern. If we say what 2 squared is, well, based on this definition, we start with a 1, and we multiply it by 2 two times."
Math,"So times 2 times 2 is going to be equal to 4. And we've seen this before. You go to 2 to the third, you start with the 1, and then multiply it by 2 three times. So times 2 times 2 times 2. This is going to give us positive 8. And you probably see a pattern here. Every time we multiply by 2-- or every time, I should say, we raise 2 to one more power, we are multiplying by 2. Notice this, to go from 2 to the 0 to 2 to the 1, we multiplied by 2."
Math,"I'll use a little x for the multiplication symbol now, a little cross. And then to go from 2 to the first power to 2 to the second power, we multiply by 2 and multiply by 2 again. And that makes complete sense because this is literally telling us how many times are we going to take this number and-- how many times are we going take 1 and multiply it by this number? And so when you go from 2 to the second power to 2 to the third, you're multiplying by 2 one more time."
Math,"And this is another intuition of why something to the 0 power is equal to 1. If you were to go backwards, if, say, we didn't know what 2 to the 0 power is and we were just trying to figure out what would make sense, well, when we go from 2 to the third power to 2 to the second, we'd be dividing by 2. We're going from 9 to 4. Then we'd divide by 2 again to go from 2 to the second to 2 to the first. And then it seems like we should just divide by 2 again from going from 2 to the first to 2 to the 0."
Math,And that would give us 1..
Math,"There's also true if you had the same sign, a negative times a negative, that that was also going to be equal to a positive number. And that the way that you get a negative number, is if you multiply or divide something of different signs. So if you have a positive times a negative that would give you a negative number. Or if you had a negative, negative times a positive, that also would give you a negative number. And here I wrote it for multiplication, but it also applies to division."
Math,"A negative divided by a negative is positive. A negative divided by a positive would be negative. Now all of these, we thought about if we're only multiplying or dividing two things. But I was just thinking about what happens if we multiply or divide three things, or four things, or five things, or n things together, what we might expect? So let's say that we were to multiply a times, and now I'm going to write the dot for times. A times b times c, a times b times c."
Math,"Now if I told you that these were all positive numbers, then you say, ""OK a times b times c is going ""to be positive."" ""A times b would be positive, and that times c is positive."" Now what would happen if I were to tell you that they were all negative numbers. What if a, b, and c were all negative? Well if there were all negative, let me write it that way. Let me actually write, let me write, a, b, and c, a, b, and c, they're all going to be negative."
Math,"So if that's the case, what is this product going to be equal to? Well you're going to have a negative here, times a negative. So a negative times a negative, a times b, if you do that first, and we can when we multiply these numbers. That's going to give you a positive. So a times b is going to give you a positive. But then you're going to multiply that times c. You're going to multiply that times c, which is a negative. So you're going to have a positive times a negative, which is going to be a negative."
Math,"So this one, if a, b, and c are all less than zero, then the product, a, b, c is going to be less than zero as well. This whole thing is going to be negative. Now, if I did something else. If I said, ""There's other ways ""that I can make the product negative."" If a is, let's say that a, actually let me just write it this way. Let's say that a is positive, b is negative. B is negative, and c is positive. And c is positive. Well here, positive times a negative, if you do this first."
Math,"Positive times a negative is going to give you a negative. And then a negative times a positive, different signs, is going to give you a negative. So this whole thing, this whole thing is going to be a negative. But let's keep on doing, we said, look if all of them are negative, then this thing would be negative, but that's because I had three numbers here."
Math,"What if I had four numbers here? What if I had times, What if I had times d here? And if I told you all of these numbers were negative? Let's think about it, if negative, negative, negative, negative. And I can do the multiplication in any order, but I'll just go left to right. A times b, negative times a negative. That would yield a positive. Now if you multiply that product times c, positive times a negative, positive times a negative, positive times a negative that would give you a negative."
Math,"And then you multiply this negative times this negative, so this whole product, a, b, c, is going to be negative. But then we multiply it times a negative. Well a negative times a negative is going to be a positive. So this whole thing is going to be a positive. And so you're probably seeing a pattern here. If you're multiplying a bunch of numbers, if you're multiplying a bunch of numbers, and if you have an odd number of negatives, odd number of negatives being multiplied, and or divided."
Math,"I just did multiplication here, but this would have also been true if these were all division symbols. If these were all division symbols, we would've been able to say the exact same thing. If you have an odd number of negative numbers in your product or in your quotient, well then you're going to have a negative, you're going to have a negative value for the entire expression."
Math,"If you have an even, if you have an even number of negative, well then the whole thing is going to be, the whole thing is going to be positive. And so you can view these as generalizations of what we just saw here. Positive times a positive. You have zero negative. Zero is actually an even number, so this would be positive. Negative times a negative. Well that's an even number of negatives. You have two negatives, so that's this case again. That's this case again, so you're going to be positive."
Math,"Either of these cases, you have one negative. You have one negative in either of these cases, so it's going to be this case, odd number of negatives. So that's going to be a negative. And so, we can use this knowledge to start dealing with negative numbers and exponents. So if I were to say, I would have a to the, let me throw out a wild number here, A to the 101st power, And we know that a is less than zero. What is this going to be? Well this is taking 101 A's and multiplying them together."
Math,"You have an odd number, an odd number of negatives being multiplied together? Well this whole then is going, this whole thing is going to be less than zero. If we knew what a was, we could calculate it somehow, but we know that this thing is going to be negative. Let's do something, so, and we could do it other ways. We could say something like this. Actually, let me try another one."
Math,"What if I tell you that a is less than zero, and b is also less than zero, and if I had a to the 101 power, divided by b to the seventh power, what would this expression be? Would it be positive or negative? Or zero, maybe? Well you see here, a to the 101st power. You have an odd number of, you have an odd number of negative numbers being multiplied. So this whole thing is going to be negative. And the same thing applies here. You have a negative number to an odd power."
Math,"You have an odd number of this negative number being multiplied together. So that's going to be negative, but then you have a negative divided by a negative. A negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive. So this thing, right here, is going to be positive. So this is just the beginning, and in the next few videos we'll actually do a bunch of examples that really test our understanding of this.."
Math,"You could literally view this as taking eight 1's, and then multiplying them together. So let's do that. So you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight 1's, and then you're going to multiply them together. And if you were to do that, you would get well, 1 times 1 is 1, times 1-- it doesn't matter how many times you multiply 1 by 1. You are going to just get 1. You are just going to get 1. And you could imagine. I did it eight times. I multiplied eight 1's."
Math,"But even if this was 80, or if this was 800, or if this was 8 million, if I just multiplied 1-- if I had 8 million 1's, and I multiplied them all together, it would still be equal to 1. So 1 to any power is just going to be equal to 1. And you might say, hey, what about 1 to the 0 power? Well, we've already said anything to 0 power, except for 0-- that's where we're going to-- it's actually up for debate. But anything to the 0 power is going to be equal to 1."
Math,"And just as a little bit of intuition here, you could literally view this as our other definition of exponentiation, which is you start with a 1, and this number says how many times you're going to multiply that 1 times this number. So 1 times 1 zero times is just going to be 1."
Math,"And that was a little bit clearer when we did it like this, where we said 2 to the, let's say, fourth power is equal to-- this was the other definition of exponentiation we had, which is you start with a 1, and then you multiply it by 2 four times, so times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, which is equal to-- let's see, this is equal to 16. So here if you start with a 1 and then you multiply it by 1 zero times, you're still going to have that 1 right over there."
Math,"And that's why anything that's not 0 to the 1 power is going to be equal to 1. Now let's try some other interesting scenarios. Let's start try some negative numbers. So let's take negative 1. And let's first raise it to the 0 power. So once again, this is just going, based on this definition, this is starting with a 1 and then multiplying it by this number 0 times. Well, that means we're just not going to multiply it by this number. So you're just going to get a 1. Let's try negative 1."
Math,"Let's try negative 1 to the first power. Well, anything to the first power, you could view this-- and I like going with this definition as opposed to this one right over here. If we were to make them consistent, if you were to make this definition consistent with this, you would say hey, let's start with a 1, and then multiply it by 1 eight times. And you're still going to get a 1 right over here. But let's do this with negative 1."
Math,"So we're going to start with a 1, and then we're going to multiply it by negative 1 one time-- times negative 1. And this is, of course, going to be equal to negative 1. Now let's take negative 1, and let's take it to the second power. We often say that we are squaring it when we take something to the second power. So negative 1 to the second power-- well, we could start with a 1. We could start with a 1, and then multiply it by negative 1 two times-- multiply it by negative 1 twice."
Math,"And what's this going to be equal to? And once again, by our old definition, you could also just say, hey, ignoring this one, because that's not going to change the value, we took two negative 1's and we're multiplying them. Well, negative 1 times negative 1 is 1. And I think you see a pattern forming. Let's take negative 1 to the third power."
Math,"What's this going to be equal to? Well, by this definition, you start with a 1, and then you multiply it by negative 1 three times, so negative 1 times negative 1 times negative 1. Or you could just think of it as you're taking three negative 1's and you're multiplying it, because this 1 doesn't change the value. And this is going to be equal to negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1, times negative 1 is negative 1. So you see the pattern. Negative 1 to the 0 power is 1."
Math,"Negative 1 to the first power is negative 1. Then you multiply it by negative 1, you're going to get positive 1. Then you multiply it by negative 1 again to get negative 1. And the pattern you might be seeing is if you take negative 1 to an odd power you're going to get negative 1. And if you take it to an even power, you're going to get 1 because a negative times a negative is going to be the positive."
Math,"And you're going to have an even number of negatives, so that you're always going to have negative times negatives. So this right over here, this is even. Even is going to be positive 1. And then you could see that if you went to negative 1 to the fourth power. Negative 1 the fourth power? Well, you could start with a 1 and then multiply it by negative 1 four times, so a negative 1 times negative 1, times negative 1, times negative 1, which is just going to be equal to positive 1."
Math,"So if someone were to ask you-- we already established that if someone were to take 1 to the, I don't know, 1 millionth power, this is just going to be equal to 1. If someone told you let's take negative 1 and raise it to the 1 millionth power, well, 1 million is an even number, so this is still going to be equal to positive 1. But if you took negative 1 to the 999,999th power, this is an odd number. So this is going to be equal to negative 1.."
Math,"So if s is a negative number, we first have s to the 67th power. And we just have to remind ourselves, a negative number being multiplied, if you have an odd number of negative numbers being multiplied together, you're going to have a negative number. And s to the 67th power, that's 67 ses, so it's literally s times s times s, and you literally are going to have 67 of these ses, and you're multiplying them all together."
Math,"So you have an odd number of ses, an odd number of negative numbers that you're multiplying together. So if you have an odd number of negative numbers multiplied together? Well that means that the product is going to be negative. So this thing right over here is going to be negative. Now what's t to the ninth? Well, t is a positive number, they tell us that. They tell us that t is greater than zero."
Math,"Well, a positive number, really to any power, however many you have that multiply together with an even or odd, if it's just all positive, well this is going to be positive. So this thing right over here is going to be positive. Now what's a negative divided by a positive? Well a negative divided by a positive is going to be negative. We've already seen that show before. So this whole thing, I'll circle it like that, is going to be a negative."
Math,"And so that this thing doesn't get too messy, actually let me just rewrite this. So all of this stuff that we've written over here, I'll just write this as this is going to be some negative number, and then we're going to divide it by 3s times s over 4t. Now this expression right over here. What is s divided by 4t going to be? Is that going to be positive or negative? Well we know that s is negative. T is positive, so four times t is going to be positive."
Math,"So this thing right over here is going to be positive. Negative divided by positive, well that's going to be a negative. So actually let me just write it this way. So all of this stuff, I could just replace with s divided by 4t is going to be a negative. So times a negative, times some other negative number. Now what's 3s? Well s is negative, so 3s is negative. So that is negative, so you have a negative times a negative. Which is a positive. So all of this business right over here is going to be positive."
Math,"Another way you could think about it is you're going to have a negative times a negative, which is positive, and then divide that by a positive, it's just going to be positive. So all of that, so this whole thing, all of this business right over here, is going to be a positive. This is all a negative, this is a positive. You're gonna have a negative divided by a positive. Well that's just going to be negative."
Math,"So the sign of this crazy expression right over here? It's going to be negative if s is less than zero and t is greater than zero. Let's keep going, this is fun. All right. So what is the sign of p times q over p, times four and 2/7, when p is greater than zero, and q is equal to zero. And the way I just stressed q is equal to zero should be a big hint. And let me give you another hint."
Math,"Pause the video, if you really think about what I just said, that q is equal to zero, you should be able to do this in less than a second. So why did I say that you could do this in less than a second? Well if you just have a bunch of numbers, and then you multiply them times zero at some point in that, the whole thing is just going to be equal to zero. I could literally have a times b times c times d, I could multiply a bunch of numbers."
Math,"And if I just knew that one of these numbers is zero, then the whole product is going to be equal to zero. You know if c is equal to zero, I could multiply a times b times d times e and get some number, and then multiply that times c, it's gonna be anything times zero is zero. Now notice, q is equal to zero, and q is right over here. So I could take p divided by p, that's gonna be one."
Math,"One times q, that's just gonna be zero, as one times zero is zero, then you're gonna have zero times four and 2/7, it's just all gonna be zero. And the key is, there's a zero right over here. At some point you're multiplying this entire product times zero, so the whole product is going, or you're multiplying these numbers times zero, so the whole product is going to be zero. So this side isn't positive or negative, it's zero. All right, there's no sign there. It's neither positive nor negative."
Math,"All right, let's do another one. What is the sign of negative 3/4 times negative a to the fourth over three, when a is less than zero? So they're telling us that a is negative. So a is negative. So let me use a more dramatic color. So right over here, I have a negative number to the fourth power. So it's a times a times a times a. And we've already said if you have an even number of negatives being multiplied by each other, then that's going to be a positive."
Math,"You could even see it over here, I mean they're all negative, but a negative times a negative is going to be a positive. A negative times the negative, I take the third and the fourth one here, that's gonna be a positive. And then a positive times a positive, the whole thing is going to be positive, even though each of these are negative."
Math,"Negative times negative, or another way you could say it, a times a is going to be positive, then times a is going to be negative, but then you multiply times a again, it's going to be positive again. So a to the fourth power is going to be positive. But then you have a negative in front of it. So you're taking the negative of a positive divided by a positive, Well, so this, all of this stuff right over here is all gonna be positive, but then you have this negative in front."
Math,"So this entire thing inside the parentheses is going to be a negative. And then you have a negative, negative 3/4, times a negative, well a negative times a negative, the whole thing is going to be positive. So what's the sign of this? It's going to be positive. Let's do another one, I'm having too much fun. All right, what is the sign of x to the 59th power, divided by 2.3x times 4/5, when x is less than zero? So x is once again a negative number."
Math,"So x to the 59th power, that's an odd number of negatives being multiplied together. So this thing right over here is going to be negative. That's going to be negative right over there. And this x right over here is going to be negative. And so 2.3 times that x, well that's going to be negative as well, so this thing is going to be negative. That's going to be negative. A negative divided by a negative, is a positive. So all of this business is going to be a positive."
Math,"A positive times a positive, well that's just gonna be positive. So all of this whole thing is going to be positive. I can't stop, this is, all right. What is the sign of negative x, times y divided by 7/8? And here they're showing us x and y on a number line. And the key takeaways here is that x is positive, x is to the right of zero, y is negative. So let's think about this. X is positive, but then we're taking the negative of x right over here. So x is positive but negative of x is going to be negative."
Math,"You bring a negative number in front of a positive number, that's going to be a negative number. Now what's y divided by 7/8? Y is a negative number. I'm dividing it by a positive number. So a negative divided by a positive is going to be a negative. So this whole expression, this whole expression right over here, is going to be negative. And then we have a negative, all of this stuff, times a negative, well that's going to give us a positive. So the whole thing here is going to be positive.."
Math,"So here, we're only gonna have one two, so it's gonna be one times two, which is, of course, equal to two. If I were to say what is two to the second power? Well, that's going to be equal to one times, and now I'm gonna have two twos, so times two times two, which is equal to four. And you could keep going like that. Now, the reason why I have this one here, and we've done this before, is to justify, and there's many other good reasons why two to the zero power should be equal to one."
Math,"But you could see, if we use the same exact idea here, you start with a one, and then you multiply it by two zero times. Well, that's just going to end up with a one. So, so far I've told you this video's about powers of zero, but I've been doing powers of two. So let's focus on zero now. So what do you think zero to the first power is going to be? Pause this video, and try to figure that out. Well, you do the exact same idea. You start with a one, and then multiply it by zero one time."
Math,"So times zero, and this is going to be equal to zero. What do you think zero to the second power is going to be equal to? Pause this video and think about that. Well, it's going to be one times zero twice, so times zero times zero. And I think you see where this is going. This is also going to be equal to zero. What do you think zero to some arbitrary positive integer is going to be? Well, it's going to be equal to one times zero that positive integer number of times."
Math,"So once again, it's going to be equal to zero. And in general, you can extend that. Zero to any positive value exponent is going to give you zero. So that's pretty straightforward. But there is an interesting edge case here. What do you think zero to the zeroth power should be? Pause this video and think about that. Well, this is actually contested. Different people will tell you different things."
Math,"If you use the intuition behind exponentiation that we've been using in this video, you would say, all right, I would start with a one and then multiply it by zero zero times. Or in other words, I just wouldn't multiply it by zero, in which case I'm just left with the one, the zero to the zeroth power should be equal to one. Other folks would say, ""Hey, no, I'm with the zero and that's the zeroth power, maybe it should be a zero."" And that's why a lot of folks leave it undefined."
Math,"Most of the time, you're going to see zero to the zeroth power, either being undefined or that it is equal to one.."
Math,"You might be tempted to say, oh is that 6? And I would say no, it is not 6. This means 2 times itself, three times. So this is going to be equal to 2 times 2 times 2, which is equal to 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 2 is equal to 8. If I were to ask you what 3 to the second power is, or 3 squared, this is equal to 3 times itself two times. This is equal to 3 times 3. Which is equal to 9. Let's do one more of these. I think you're getting the general sense, if you've never seen these before."
Math,"Let's say I have 5 to the seventh power. That's equal to 5 times itself, seven times. 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5. That's seven, right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. This is going to be a really, really, really, really, large number and I'm not going to calculate it right now. If you want to do it by hand, feel free to do so. Or use a calculator, but this is a really, really, really, large number."
Math,"So one thing that you might appreciate very quickly is that exponents increase very rapidly. 5 to the 17th would be even a way, way more massive number. But anyway, that's a review of exponents. Let's get a little bit steeped in algebra, using exponents. So what would 3x-- let me do this in a different color-- what would 3x times 3x times 3x be? Well, one thing you need to remember about multiplication is, it doesn't matter what order you do the multiplication in."
Math,"So this is going to be the same thing as 3 times 3 times 3 times x times x times x. And just based on what we reviewed just here, that part right there, 3 times 3, three times, that's 3 to the third power. And this right here, x times itself three times. that's x to the third power. So this whole thing can be rewritten as 3 to the third times x to the third. Or if you know what 3 to the third is, this is 9 times 3, which is 27. This is 27 x to the third power."
Math,"Now you might have said, hey, wasn't 3x times 3x times 3x. Wasn't that 3x to the third power? Right? You're multiplying 3x times itself three times. And I would say, yes it is. So this, right here, you could interpret that as 3x to the third power. And just like that, we stumbled on one of our exponent properties. Notice this. When I have something times something, and the whole thing is to the third power, that equals each of those things to the third power times each other."
Math,"So 3x to the third is the same thing is 3 to the third times x to the third, which is 27 to the third power. Let's do a couple more examples. What if I were to ask you what 6 to the third times 6 to the sixth power is? And this is going to be a really huge number, but I want to write it as a power of 6. Let me write the 6 to the sixth in a different color. 6 to the third times 6 to the sixth power, what is this going to be equal to? Well, 6 to the third, we know that's 6 times itself three times."
Math,"So it's 6 times 6 times 6. And then that's going to be times-- the times here is in green, so I'll do it in green. Maybe I'll make both of them in orange. That is going to be times 6 to the sixth power. Well, what's 6 to the sixth power? That's 6 times itself six times. So, it's 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6. Then you get one more, times 6."
Math,"So what is this whole number going to be? Well, this whole thing-- we're multiplying 6 times itself-- how many times? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine times, right? Three times here and then another six times here. So we're multiplying 6 times itself nine times. 3 plus 6. So this is equal to 6 to the 3 plus 6 power or 6 to the ninth power. And just like that, we/ve stumbled on another exponent property. When we take exponents, in this case, 6 to the third, the number 6 is the base."
Math,"We're taking the base to the exponent of 3. When you have the same base, and you're multiplying two exponents with the same base, you can add the exponents. Let me do several more examples of this. Let's do it in magenta. Let's say I had 2 squared times 2 to the fourth times 2 to the sixth. Well, I have the same base in all of these, so I can add the exponents. This is going to be equal to 2 to the 2 plus 4 plus 6, which is equal to 2 to the 12th power."
Math,"And hopefully that makes sense, because this is going to be 2 times itself two times, 2 times itself four times, 2 times itself six times. When you multiply them all out, it's going to be 2 times itself, 12 times or 2 to the 12th power. Let's do it in a little bit more abstract way, using some variables, but it's the same exact idea. What is x to the squared or x squared times x to the fourth? Well, we could use the property we just learned. We have the exact same base, x."
Math,"So it's going to be x to the 2 plus 4 power. It's going to be x to the sixth power. And if you don't believe me, what is x squared? x squared is equal to x times x. And if you were going to multiply that times x to the fourth, you're multiplying it by x times itself four times. x times x times x times x. So how many times are you now multiplying x by itself? Well, one, two, three, four, five, six times. x to the sixth power. Let's do another one of these. The more examples you see, I figure, the better."
Math,"So let's do the other property, just to mix and match it. Let's say I have a to the third to the fourth power. So I'll tell you the property here, and I'll show you why it makes sense. When you add something to an exponent, and then you raise that to an exponent, you can multiply the exponents. So this is going to be a to the 3 times 4 power or a to the 12th power. And why does that make sense? Well this right here is a to the third times itself four times."
Math,"So this is equal to a to the third times a to the third times a to the third times a to the third. Well, we have the same base, so we can add the exponents. So there's going to be a to the 3 times 4, right? This is equal to a to the 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 power, which is the same thing is a the 3 times 4 power or a to the 12th power."
Math,"So just to review the properties we've learned so far in this video, besides just a review of what an exponent is, if I have x to the a power times x to the b power, this is going to be equal to x to the a plus b power. We saw that right here. x squared times x to the fourth is equal to x to the sixth, 2 plus 4. We also saw that if I have x times y to the a power, this is the same thing is x to the a power times y to the a power. We saw that early on in this video. We saw that over here."
Math,"3x to the third is the same thing as 3 to the third times x to the third. That's what this is saying right here. 3x to the third is the same thing is 3 to the third times x to the third. And then the last property, which we just stumbled upon is, if you have x to the a and then you raise that to the bth power, that's equal to x to the a times b. And we saw that right there. a to the third and then raise that to the fourth power is the same thing is a to the 3 times 4 or a to the 12th power."
Math,"So let's use these properties to do a handful of more complex problems. Let's say we have 2xy squared times negative x squared y squared times three x squared y squared. And we wanted to simplify this. This you can view as negative 1 times x squared times y squared. So if we take this whole thing to the squared power, this is like raising each of these to the second power. So this part right here could be simplified as negative 1 squared times x squared squared, times y squared."
Math,"And then if we were to simplify that, negative 1 squared is just 1, x squared squared-- remember you can just multiply the exponents-- so that's going to be x to the fourth y squared. That's what this middle part simplifies to. And let's see if we can merge it with the other parts. The other parts, just to remember, were 2 xy squared, and then 3x squared y squared. Well now we're just going ahead and just straight up multiplying everything."
Math,"And we learned in multiplication that it doesn't matter which order you multiply things in. So I can just rearrange. We're just going and multiplying 2 times x times y squared times x to the fourth times y squared times 3 times x squared times y squared. So I can rearrange this, and I will rearrange it so that it's in a way that's easy to simplify. So I can multiply 2 times 3, and then I can worry about the x terms. Let me do it in this color. Then I have times x times x to the fourth times x squared."
Math,"And then I have to worry about the y terms, times y squared times another y squared times another y squared. And now what are these equal to? Well, 2 times 3. You knew how to do that. That's equal to 6. And what is x times x to the fourth times x squared. Well, one thing to remember is x is the same thing as x to the first power. Anything to the first power is just that number. So you know, 2 to the first power is just 2. 3 to the first power is just 3."
Math,"So what is this going to be equal to? This is going to be equal to-- we have the same base, x. We can add the exponents, x to the 1 plus 4 plus 2 power, and I'll add it in the next step. And then on the y's, this is times y to the 2 plus 2 plus 2 power. And what does that give us? That gives us 6 x to the seventh power, y to the sixth power. And I'll just leave you with some thing that you might already know, but it's pretty interesting."
Math,"And that's the question of what happens when you take something to the zeroth power? So if I say 7 to the zeroth power, What does that equal? And I'll tell you right now-- and this might seem very counterintuitive-- this is equal to 1, or 1 to the zeroth power is also equal to 1. Anything that the zeroth power, any non-zero number to the zero power is going to be equal to 1. And just to give you a little bit of intuition on why that is. Think about it this way."
Math,"3 to the first power-- let me write the powers-- 3 to the first, second, third. We'll just do it the with the number 3. So 3 to the first power is 3. I think that makes sense. 3 to the second power is 9. 3 to the third power is 27. And of course, we're trying to figure out what should 3 to the zeroth power be? Well, think about it. Every time you decrement the exponent. Every time you take the exponent down by 1, you are dividing by 3. To go from 27 to 9, you divide by 3."
Math,"To go from 9 to 3, you divide by 3. So to go from this exponent to that exponent, maybe we should divide by 3 again. And that's why, anything to the zeroth power, in this case, 3 to the zeroth power is 1. See you in the next video.."
Math,"And I'm going to raise it to-- I could do it in the abstract. I could raise it to the c power. But I'll do it a little bit more concrete. Let's raise it to the fourth power. What is that going to be equal to? Well that's going to be equal to-- I could write it like this. Copy and paste this, copy and paste. That's going to be equal to ab times ab times ab times ab times ab."
Math,But what is that equal to? Well when you just multiply a bunch of numbers like this it doesn't matter what order you're going to multiply it in. This right over here is going to be equivalent to a times a times a times a times-- We have four b's as well that we're multiplying together. Times b times b times b times b. And what is that equal to? Well this right over here is a to the fourth power. And this right over here is b to the fourth power.
Math,"And so you see, if you take the product of two numbers and you raise them to some exponent, that's equivalent to taking each of the numbers to that exponent. And then taking their product. And here I just used the example with 4, but you could do this really with any arbitrary-- actually any exponent. This property holds. And you could satisfy yourself by trying different values, and using the same logic right over here. But this is a general property."
Math,"That-- let me write it this way-- that if I have a to the b, to the c power, that this is going to be equal to a to the c times b to the c power. And we'll use this to throughout actually mathematics, when we try to simplify things or rewrite an expression in a different way. Now let me introduce you to another core idea here. And this is the idea of raising something to some power. And I'll just use example of 3. And then raising that to some power."
Math,"What could this be simplified as? Well let's think about it. This is the same thing as a to the third-- let me copy and paste that-- as a to the third times a to the third. And what is a to the third times-- So this is equal to a to the third times a to the third. And that's going to be equal to a to the 3 plus 3 power. We have the same base, so we would add and they're being multiplied. They're being raised to these two exponents."
Math,"So it's going to be the sum of the exponents, which of course is going to be equal to a-- that's a different color a-- it's going to be a to the sixth power. So what just happened over here? Well I took two a to the thirds. And I multiplied them together. So I took these two 3s and added them together. So this essentially right over here, you could view this as 2 times 3. That's how we got the 6."
Math,"When I raise something to one exponent, and then raised it to another, that's the equivalent to raising the base to the product of those two exponents. I just did it with this example right over here. But I encourage you try other numbers to see how this works. And I could to do this in general. I could say a to the b power. And then-- let me copy and paste that-- and then I'm going to raise that to the c power."
Math,"Well what is that going to give me? Well I'm essentially going to have to take c of these, so one, two, three. I don't know how large of a number c is, so I'll just do the dot, dot dot. So dot, dot, dot. I have c of these, right over here. So what is that going to be equal to? Well that is going to be equal to a to the-- well for each of these c, I'm going to have a b that I'm going to add together. So let me write this. So I'm going to have a b plus b plus b plus dot, dot, dot plus b."
Math,"And now I have c of these b's, so I have c b's right over here. Or you could view this as a, this is equal to a to the c times b power. c or a, you could do a to the cb power. So very useful. So if someone were to say what is 35 to the third power, and then that raised to the seventh power? Well this is going to obviously be a huge number. But we could at least simplify the expression. This is going to be equal to 35 to the product of these two exponents."
Math,"It's going to be 35 to the 3 times 7, or 35 to the 21, or to the 21st power.."
Math,"And 5 squared, that's just 5 times itself two times, so it's just going to be 5 times 5. Well, we know how to simplify a fraction or a rational expression like this. We can divide the numerator and the denominator by one 5, and then these will cancel out, and then we can do it by another 5, or this 5 and this 5 will cancel out. And what are we going to be left with? 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 over 1, or you could say that this is just 5 to the fourth power. Now, notice what happens."
Math,"Essentially we started with six in the numerator, six 5's multiplied by themselves in the numerator, and then we subtracted out. We were able to cancel out the 2 in the denominator. So this really was equal to 5 to the sixth power minus 2. So we were able to subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator. Let's remember how this relates to multiplication. If I had 5 to the-- let me do this in a different color."
Math,"5 to the sixth times 5 to the second power, we saw in the last video that this is equal to 5 to the 6 plus-- I'm trying to make it color coded for you-- 6 plus 2 power. Now, we see a new property. And in the next video, we're going see that these aren't really different properties. They're really kind of same sides of the same coin when we learn about negative exponents."
Math,"But now in this video, we just saw that 5 to the sixth power divided by 5 to the second power-- let me do it in a different color-- is going to be equal to 5 to the-- it's time consuming to make it color coded for you-- 6 minus 2 power or 5 to the fourth power. Here it's going to be 5 to the eighth. So when you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. When you divide with the same base, you subtract the denominator exponent from the numerator exponent."
Math,"Let's do a bunch more of these examples right here. What is 6 to the seventh power divided by 6 to the third power? Well, once again, we can just use this property. This going to be 6 to the 7 minus 3 power, which is equal to 6 to the fourth power. And you can multiply it out this way like we did in the first problem and verify that it indeed will be 6 to the fourth power. Now let's try something interesting. This will be a good segue into the next video."
Math,"Let's say we have 3 to the fourth power divided by 3 to the tenth power. Well, if we just go from basic principles, this would be 3 times 3 times 3 times 3, all of that over 3 times 3-- we're going to have ten of these-- 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 times 3. How many is that? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, if we do what we did in the last video, this 3 cancels with that 3. Those 3's cancel. Those 3's cancel. Those 3's cancel."
Math,"And we're left with 1 over-- one, two, three, four, five, six 3's. So 1 over 3 to the sixth power, right? We have 1 over all of these 3's down here. But that property that I just told you, would have told you that this should also be equal to 3 to the 4 minus 10 power. What's 4 minus 10? Well, you're going to get a negative number. This is 3 to the negative sixth power. So using the property we just saw, you'd get 3 to the negative sixth power."
Math,"Just multiplying them out, you get 1 over 3 to the sixth power. And the fun part about all of this is these are the same quantity. So now you're learning a little bit about what it means to take a negative exponent. 3 to the negative sixth power is equal to 1 over 3 to the sixth power. And I'm going do many, many more examples of this in the next video. But if you take anything to the negative power, so a to the negative b power is equal to 1 over a to the b."
Math,"That's one thing that we just established just now. And earlier in this video, we saw that if I have a to the b over a to the c, that this is equal to a to the b minus c. That's the other property we've been using. Now, using what we've just learned and what we learned in the last video, let's do some more complicated problems. Let's say I have a to the third, b to the fourth power over a squared b, and all of that to the third power. Well, we can use the property we just learned to simplify the inside."
Math,"This is going to be equal to-- a to the third divided by a squared. That's a to the 3 minus 2 power, right? So this would simplify to just an a. And you could imagine, this is a times a times a divided by a times a. You'll just have an a on top. And then the b, b to the fourth divided by b, well, that's just going to be b to the third, right? This is b to the first power. 4 minus 1 is 3, and then all of that in parentheses to the third power. We don't want to forget about this third power out here."
Math,"This third power is this one. Let me color code it. That third power is that one right there, and then this a in orange is that a right there. I think we understand what maps to what. And now we can use the property that when we multiply something and take it to the third power, this is equal to a to the third power times b to the third to the third power. And then this is going to be equal to a to the third power. times b to the 3 times 3 power, times b to the ninth."
Math,"And we would have simplified this about as far as you can go. Let's do one more of these. I think they're good practice and super-valuable experience later on. Let's say I have 25xy to the sixth over 20y to the fifth x squared. So once again, we can rearrange the numerators and the denominators. So this you could rewrite as 25 over 20 times x over x squared, right? We could have made this bottom 20x squared y to the fifth-- it doesn't matter the order we do it in-- times y to the sixth over y to the fifth."
Math,"And let's use our newly learned exponent properties in actually just simplify fractions. 25 over 20, if you divide them both by 5, this is equal to 5 over 4. x divided by x squared-- well, there's two ways you could think about it. That you could view as x to the negative 1. You have a first power here. 1 minus 2 is negative 1. So this right here is equal to x to the negative 1 power. Or it could also be equal to 1 over x. These are equivalent. So let's say that this is equal into 1 over x, just like that."
Math,"And it would be. x over x times x. One of those sets of x's would cancel out and you're just left with 1 over x. And then finally, y to the sixth over y to the fifth, that's y to the 6 minus 5 power, which is just y to the first power, or just y, so times y."
Math,"So if you want to write it all out as just one combined rational expression, you have 5 times 1 times y, which would be 5y, all of that over 4 times x, right? This is y over 1, so 4 times x times 1, all of that over 4x, and we have successfully simplified it.."
Math,"And that will give us, let's see, 2 times 2 is 4, 8, 16. So that will give us 16. Now I will ask you a more interesting question. What do you think 2 to the negative 4 power is? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about that. Well, you might be tempted to say, oh maybe it's negative 16 or something like that, but remember what the exponent operation is trying to do."
Math,"One way of viewing it is this is telling us how many times are we going to multiply 2 times negative 1? But here we're going to multiply negative 4 times. Well, what does negative traditionally mean? Negative traditionally means the opposite. So here this is how many times you're going to multiply. Maybe when we make it negative this says, how many times are we going to, starting with the 1, how many times are we going to divide by 2? So let's think about that a little that."
Math,"So this could be viewed as 1 times, and we're going to divide by 2 four times. Well, dividing by 2 is the same thing as multiplying by 1/2. So we could say that this is 1 times 1/2, times-- let me just do it in one color. So 1 times 1/2, times 1/2, times 1/2, times 1/2. Notice multiplying by 1/2 four times is the exact same thing as dividing by 2 four times. And in this situation this would get you, well 1/2, well 1 times 1/2 half is just 1/2, times 1/2 is 1/4, times 1/2 is 1/8, times 1/2 is 1/16."
Math,"And so you probably see the relationship here. If you're-- this is essentially you're starting with the 1 and you're dividing by 2 four times. You could also say that 2-- I'm going to do the same colors-- 2 to the negative 4 is the same thing as 1/2 to the fourth power. Let me color code it nicely so you realize what the negative is doing. So this negative right over here-- let me do that in a better color, I'll do it in magenta, something that jumps out."
Math,"So this negative right over here, this is what's causing us to go one over. So 2 to the negative 4 is the same thing, based on the way we've defined it just up right here, as reciprocal of 2 to the fourth, or 1 over 2 to the fourth. And so you could view this as being 1/2 times 2 times 2 times 2, if you just view 2 to the fourth as taking four 2's and multiplying them. Or if you use this idea right over here, you could view it as starting with a 1 and multiplying it by 2 four times."
Math,"Either way, you are going to get 1/16. So let's do a few more examples of this just so that we make sure things are clear to us. So let's try 3 to the negative third power. So remember, whenever you see that negative, what my brain always does is say I need to take the reciprocal here. So this is going to be equal to, I'm going to highlight the negative again, this is going to be 1 over 3 to the third power. Which would be equal to 1/3 times 3 times 3, or 1 times 3 times 3 times 3, is going to be 27."
Math,"So this is going to be 1/27. Let's try another example, I'll do two or three more. So let's take a negative number to a negative exponent, just to see if we can confuse ourselves. So let's take the number negative 4, and let's take it-- I don't want my numbers to get too big too So let's just take negative 2 and let's take it to the negative 3 power. I'll make my negatives in magenta, negative 3 power."
Math,"So at first this might be daunting, do the negatives cancel? And that will just be the remnants in your brain that are trying to think of multiplying negatives. Do not apply that here. Remember, you see a negative exponent, that just means the reciprocal of the positive exponent. So 1 over negative 2 to the third power, to the positive third power. And this is equal to 1 over negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2."
Math,"Or you could view it as 1 times negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2, which is going to give you 1 over negative 8 or negative 1/8. Let me scroll over a little bit, I don't want to have to start squishing things. So this is equal to negative 1/8. Let's do one more example, just in an attempt to confuse ourselves. Let's take 5/8 and raise this to the negative 2 power. So once again, this negative, oh I got at a fraction is a negative here. Remember this just means 1 over 5/8 to the second power."
Math,"So this is just going to be the same thing as 1 over 5/8 squared, which is going to be the same thing-- so this is going to be equal to-- I'm trying to color code it, 1 over 5/8 times 5/8, which is 25/64. 1 over 25/64 is just going to be 64/25. So another way to think about it is, you're going to take the reciprocal of this and raise it to the positive exponent. So another way you could have thought about this is 5/8 to the negative 2 power."
Math,"Let me just take the reciprocal of this, 8/5 and raise it to the positive 2 power. So all of these statements are equivalent. And that would have applied even when you're dealing with non-fractions as your base right over here. So 2, you could say well this is going to be the same thing. 2 to the negative 4 is going to be the same thing as taking my reciprocal. So this is going to be the same thing as taking the reciprocal of 2, which is 1/2 and raising it to the positive 4 power.."
Math,"The inventor of mathematics wasn't one person. It was, you know, a convention that arose. But they defined this, and they defined this for the reasons that I'm going to show you. Well, what I'm going to show you is one of the reasons, and then we'll see that this is a good definition, because once you learned exponent rules, all of the other exponent rules stay consistent for negative exponents and when you raise something to the zero power. So let's take the positive exponents."
Math,"Those are pretty intuitive, I think. So the positive exponents, so you have a to the 1, a squared, a cubed, a to the fourth. What's a to the 1? a to the 1, we said, is a, and then to get to a squared, what did we do? We multiplied by a, right? a squared is just a times a. And then to get to a cubed, what did we do? We multiplied by a again. And then to get to a to the fourth, what did we do? We multiplied by a again."
Math,"Or the other way, you could imagine, is when you decrease the exponent, what are we doing? We are multiplying by 1/a, or dividing by a. And similarly, you decrease again, you're dividing by a. And to go from a squared to a to the first, you're dividing by a. So let's use this progression to figure out what a to the 0 is. So this is the first hard one. So a to the 0. So you're the inventor, the founding mother of mathematics, and you need to define what a to the 0 is."
Math,"And, you know, maybe it's 17, maybe it's pi. I don't know. It's up to you to decide what a to the 0 is. But wouldn't it be nice if a to the 0 retained this pattern? That every time you decrease the exponent, you're dividing by a, right? So if you're going from a to the first to a to the zero, wouldn't it be nice if we just divided by a? So let's do that."
Math,"So if we go from a to the first, which is just a, and divide by a, right, so we're just going to go-- we're just going to divide it by a, what is a divided by a? Well, it's just 1. So that's where the definition-- or that's one of the intuitions behind why something to the 0-th power is equal to 1. Because when you take that number and you divide it by itself one more time, you just get 1. So that's pretty reasonable, but now let's go into the negative domain."
Math,"So what should a to the negative 1 equal? Well, once again, it's nice if we can retain this pattern, where every time we decrease the exponent we're dividing by a. So let's divide by a again, so 1/a. So we're going to take a to the 0 and divide it by a. a to the 0 is one, so what's 1 divided by a? It's 1/a. Now, let's do it one more time, and then I think you're going to get the pattern. Well, I think you probably already got the pattern."
Math,"What's a to the minus 2? Well, we want-- you know, it'd be silly now to change this pattern. Every time we decrease the exponent, we're dividing by a, so to go from a to the minus 1 to a to the minus 2, let's just divide by a again. And what do we get? If you take 1/2 and divide by a, you get 1 over a squared. And you could just keep doing this pattern all the way to the left, and you would get a to the minus b is equal to 1 over a to the b."
Math,"Hopefully, that gave you a little intuition as to why-- well, first of all, you know, the big mystery is, you know, something to the 0-th power, why does that equal 1? First, keep in mind that that's just a definition. Someone decided it should be equal to 1, but they had a good reason. And their good reason was they wanted to keep this pattern going. And that's the same reason why they defined negative exponents in this way."
Math,"And what's extra cool about it is not only does it retain this pattern of when you decrease exponents, you're dividing by a, or when you're increasing exponents, you're multiplying by a, but as you'll see in the exponent rules videos, all of the exponent rules hold. All of the exponent rules are consistent with this definition of something to the 0-th power and this definition of something to the negative power."
Math,"Hopefully, that didn't confuse you and gave you a little bit of intuition and demystified something that, frankly, is quite mystifying the first time you learn it.."
Math,"So this is going to be the same thing as three to the negative eight, and then that to the negative two times seven to the third to the negative two, so I'll do seven to the third right over here. And if I wanna simplify this, three to the negative eight to the negative two, we have the other exponent property that if you're raising to an exponent and then raising that whole thing to another exponent, then you can just multiply the exponents."
Math,"So this is going to be three to the negative eight times negative two power. Well, negative eight times negative two is positive 16, so this is gonna be three to the 16th power right over there, and then this part right over here, seven to the third to the negative two. that's gonna be seven to the three times negative two, which is seven to the negative sixth power. So that is seven to the negative six, and this would be about as much as you could simplify. You could rewrite it different ways."
Math,"Seven to the negative six is the same thing as one over seven to the sixth, so you could write it like three to the 16th. We'll use that same shade of blue, three to the 16th over seven to the sixth, but these two are equivalent, and there's other ways that you could have tackled this."
Math,"You could have said that this original thing right over here, this is the same thing as, three to the negative eight is the same thing as one over three to the eighth, so you could have said this is the same thing as seven to the third over three to the eighth, and then you're raising that to the negative two, in which case you'd raise this numerator to the negative two and the denominator to negative two, but you would have gotten to the exact same place. Let's do another one of these."
Math,"So let's say that we have got A to the negative two times eight to the seventh power, and we wanna raise all of that to the second power. Well, like before, I can raise each of these things to the second power, so this is the same thing as A to the negative two to the second power times this thing to the second power."
Math,"Eight to the seventh to the second power, and then here, negative two times two is negative four, so that's A to the negative four times, eight to the seven times two is 14, eight to the 14th power. In other videos, we go into more depth about why this should hopefully make intuitive sense. Here you have eight to the seventh times eight to the seventh."
Math,"Well, you would then add the two exponents, and you would get to eight to the 14th, so however many times you have eight to the seventh, you would just keep adding the exponents, or you would multiply by seven that many times. Hopefully that didn't sound too confusing, but the general idea is if you raise something to exponent and then another exponent, you can multiply those exponents."
Math,"Let's do one more example where we are dealing with quotients, which that first example could have even been perceived as. So let's say we have two to the negative 10 divided by four squared, and we're gonna raise all of that to the seventh power."
Math,"Well, this is equivalent to two to the negative 10 raised to the seventh power over four squared raised to the seventh power, so if you have the difference of two things and you're raising it to some power, that's the same thing as a numerator raised to that power divided by the denominator raised to that power. Well, what's our numerator going to be? Well, we've done this drill before."
Math,"It'd be two to the negative 10 times seventh power, so this would be equal to two to the negative 70th power, and then in the denominator, four to the second power, then that raised to the seventh power. Well, two times seven is 14, so that's going to be four to the 17th power. Now, we actually could think about simplifying this even more."
Math,"There's multiple ways that you could rewrite this, but one thing you could do is say, ""Hey, look, ""four is a power of two."" So you could rewrite this as this is equal to two to the negative 70th power over, instead of writing four to the 17th power, why did I write the 17th power? It should be four to the 14th power. Let me correct that. Instead of writing four to the 14th power, I instead could write, so this is two, get the colors right."
Math,"This is two to the negative 70th over, instead of writing four, I could write two squared to the 14th power. Four is the same thing as two squared, and so now I can rewrite this whole thing as two to the negative 70th power over, well, two to the second, and then that to the 14th, well, that's two to the 28th power, two to the 28th power. And so can I simplify this even more? Well, this is going to be equal to two to the, if I'm taking a quotient with the same base, I can subtract the exponent."
Math,"So it's gonna be negative 70. It's going to be negative 70 minus 28th power, minus 28, and so this is going to simply two to the negative 98th power, and that's another way of viewing the same expression.."
Math,"So here, we're only gonna have one two, so it's gonna be one times two, which is, of course, equal to two. If I were to say what is two to the second power? Well, that's going to be equal to one times, and now I'm gonna have two twos, so times two times two, which is equal to four. And you could keep going like that. Now, the reason why I have this one here, and we've done this before, is to justify, and there's many other good reasons why two to the zero power should be equal to one."
Math,"But you could see, if we use the same exact idea here, you start with a one, and then you multiply it by two zero times. Well, that's just going to end up with a one. So, so far I've told you this video's about powers of zero, but I've been doing powers of two. So let's focus on zero now. So what do you think zero to the first power is going to be? Pause this video, and try to figure that out. Well, you do the exact same idea. You start with a one, and then multiply it by zero one time."
Math,"So times zero, and this is going to be equal to zero. What do you think zero to the second power is going to be equal to? Pause this video and think about that. Well, it's going to be one times zero twice, so times zero times zero. And I think you see where this is going. This is also going to be equal to zero. What do you think zero to some arbitrary positive integer is going to be? Well, it's going to be equal to one times zero that positive integer number of times."
Math,"So once again, it's going to be equal to zero. And in general, you can extend that. Zero to any positive value exponent is going to give you zero. So that's pretty straightforward. But there is an interesting edge case here. What do you think zero to the zeroth power should be? Pause this video and think about that. Well, this is actually contested. Different people will tell you different things."
Math,"If you use the intuition behind exponentiation that we've been using in this video, you would say, all right, I would start with a one and then multiply it by zero zero times. Or in other words, I just wouldn't multiply it by zero, in which case I'm just left with the one, the zero to the zeroth power should be equal to one. Other folks would say, ""Hey, no, I'm with the zero and that's the zeroth power, maybe it should be a zero."" And that's why a lot of folks leave it undefined."
Math,"Most of the time, you're going to see zero to the zeroth power, either being undefined or that it is equal to one.."
Math,"So the first thing I would want to do is let's just change the order of multiplication. Let's multiply the nine and the negative two first and then we can multiply the 10 to the ninth and 10 to the negative third power. So if I were to change the order, we could write this as nine times, nine times, nine times negative two. Nine times negative two times 10 to the ninth power. Times ten, let me do it in that, in this color. Times ten to the ninth power. Times 10 to the negative third power."
Math,"Times 10 to the negative third power. Now what's nine times negative two? Well, if nine times two is 18, nine times negative two is gonna be negative 18. So that's negative 18."
Math,"And what is 10 to the ninth times 10 to the negative three? Well if I have a number raised to some exponent times that same number, I have 10, I have the same base for both of these, time that same number raised to another exponent, this is going to be the same thing as that number, as that base, raised to the sum of these exponents. This comes straight out of our exponents properties. So this is going to be 10 to the, 10 to the nine plus negative three power."
Math,"Nine plus, actually, let me use those colors so you see where that nine and that negative three came from. plus negative three power. Nine plus, this color, I'm having trouble changing colors. Nine plus negative three power. Now what's this gonna be? Well this is going to be equal to negative 18 times 10 to the, nine plus negative three, same thing as nine minus three, which is six. Negative 18 times 10 to the sixth power."
Math,"And if you wanted to think about well what number is this? 10 to the sixth, that's one with six zeros, this is a million. Negative 18 times a million, it's gonna be negative 18 million. Or we could say negative 18 times 10 the the sixth. Either way. But this is another way we could have written this. We could have written this as negative 18, negative 18, let me write the zeros with the green, just for fun. Negative 18. Negative 18 million. Either way is a legitimate way to represent this number.."
Math,"This is a big difference. This is a factor of 10. This is 10 times this right over here. So which one's closer? So if I were to round this to the nearest hundred million, this would go to 300,000,000. 300,000,000, this is three times 100,000,000. This is the same thing as three times, three times 100,000,000. And 100,000,000 we see has eight zeros. So this is the same thing as three times 10 to the eighth. Three times 10 to the eighth power, which they have right over here."
Math,"Three times 10 to the ninth, that would be 3,000,000,000. That would be almost 10 times as large as this. So we would definitely wanna go with this one. Three times 10 to the eight people is a pretty good approximation. This is 300,000,000 people. So we're kind of rounding to the nearest 100,000,000. In 2014, the population of the world was about 7,125,000,000 people. Choose the best approximation of the world population in 2014."
Math,"Well here we're dealing with, this is billions here, so let me just round to the nearest billion. So we could say this is roughly 7,000,000,000. So approximately 7,000,000,000 if we're rounding to the nearest billion. A billion is 10 to the ninth. We see we have nine zeros here. So this is going to be equal to seven times 10 to the ninth power. Which is this right over here. This would be 700,000,000. This is less than a 10th of the actual world population."
Math,"This is 7,000,000,000, which is, if you're rounding to the nearest billion, how many people there were in 2014. Approximately how many times larger was the world population, how many times larger was the world population than the United States population in 2014? Well what was the world population? Once again, they're taking approximately. They're saying two, 20, 200."
Math,"So if we're saying approximately, see the world population, if we're using the approximation, was seven times 10 to the ninth power, and the United States population, we said it was roughly, in 2014, three times 10 to the eighth. So we could divide the world population, or our approximation of the world population, by our approximation of the United States population."
Math,"So our approximation of the world population divided by the approximation of the United States population, three times 10 to the eight power, well what's that going to be? This is going to be approximately, well, this is actually going to be exactly 7/3. So we could say seven divided by three, that's 7/3, times, what's 10 to the ninth divided by 10 to the eighth power? Well that's just going to be 10."
Math,"10 to the ninth is 10 to the eighth times 10, and if we divide that by 10 to the eighth, we're just gonna be left with 10. Or, if we think about exponent properties, we have the same base, 10 to the ninth, divided by 10 to the eighth, you can subtract this, the exponent in the denominator, from the exponent in the numerator. So it's going to be 10 to the nine minus eight power, 10 to the first. This is going to be times 10."
Math,"Well that's not exactly what they have over here, but we see 7/3, this is 2 1/3 times 10. So we could say this is equal to 2 1/3 times 10, which is approximately equal to, which is approximately equal to two times 10 if we're just rounding, once again, this is all for the sake of roughness, which is 20, which is 20, which is that right over there.."
Math,"Scientific notation will be some number times some power of 10 where this number right here-- let me write it this way. It's going to be greater than or equal to 1, and it's going to be less than 10. So over here, what we want to put here is what that leading number is going to be. And in general, you're going to look for the first non-zero digit. And this is the number that you're going to want to start off with."
Math,"This is the only number you're going to want to put ahead of or I guess to the left of the decimal point. So we could write 3.457, and it's going to be multiplied by 10 to something. Now let's think about what we're going to have to multiply it by. To go from 3.457 to this very, very small number, from 3.457, to get to this, you have to move the decimal to the left a bunch. You have to add a bunch of zeroes to the left of the 3. You have to keep moving the decimal over to the left."
Math,"To do that, we're essentially making the number much much, much smaller. So we're not going to multiply it by a positive exponent of 10. We're going to multiply it times a negative exponent of 10. The equivalent is you're dividing by a positive exponent of 10. And so the best way to think about it, when you move an exponent one to the left, you're dividing by 10, which is equivalent to multiplying by 10 to the negative 1 power. Let me give you example here."
Math,"So if I have 1 times 10 is clearly just equal to 10. 1 times 10 to the negative 1, that's equal to 1 times 1/10, which is equal to 1/10. 1 times-- and let me actually write a decimal, which is equal to 0-- let me actually-- I skipped a step right there. Let me add 1 times 10 to the 0, so we have something natural. So this is one times 10 to the first. One times 10 to the 0 is equal to 1 times 1, which is equal to 1. 1 times 10 to the negative 1 is equal to 1/10, which is equal to 0.1."
Math,"If I do 1 times 10 to the negative 2, 10 to the negative 2 is 1 over 10 squared or 1/100. So this is going to be 1/100, which is 0.01. What's happening here? When I raise it to a negative 1 power, I've essentially moved the decimal from to the right of the 1 to the left of the 1. I've moved it from there to there. When I raise it to the negative 2, I moved it two over to the left."
Math,"So how many times are we going to have to move it over to the left to get this number right over here? So let's think about how many zeroes we have. So we have to move it one time just to get in front of the 3. And then we have to move it that many more times to get all of the zeroes in there so that we have to move it one time to get the 3. So if we started here, we're going to move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times. So this is going to be 3.457 times 10 to the negative 10 power. Let me just rewrite it."
Math,"So 3.457 times 10 to the negative 10 power. So in general, what you want to do is you want to find the first non-zero number here. Remember, you want a number here that's between 1 and 10. And it can be equal to 1, but it has to be less than 10. 3.457 definitely fits that bill. It's between 1 and 10."
Math,And then you just want to count the leading zeroes between the decimal and that number and include the number because that tells you how many times you have to shift the decimal over to actually get this number up here. And so we have to shift this decimal 10 times to the left to get this thing up here..
Math,"Algebra I book to do some more scientific notation examples. So let's take some things that are written in scientific notation. Just as a reminder, scientific notation is useful because it allows us to write really large, or really small numbers, in ways that are easy for our brains to, one, write down, and two, understand. So let's write down some numbers. So let's say I have 3.102 times 10 to the second. And I want to write it as just a numerical value. It's in scientific notation already."
Math,"It's written as a product with a power of 10. So how do I write this? It's just a numeral. Well, there's a slow way and the fast way. The slow way is to say, well, this is the same thing as 3.102 times 100, which means if you multiplied 3.102 times 100, it'll be 3, 1, 0, 2, with two 0's behind it. And then we have 1, 2, 3 numbers behind the decimal point, and that'd be the right answer. This is equal to 310.2."
Math,"Now, a faster way to do this is just to say, well, look, right now I have only the 3 in front of the decimal point. When I take something times 10 to the second power, I'm essentially shifting the decimal point 2 to the right. So 3.102 times 10 to the second power is the same thing as-- if I shift the decimal point 1, and then 2, because this is 10 to the second power-- it's same thing as 310.2. So this might be a faster way of doing it."
Math,"Every time you multiply it by 10, you shift the decimal to the right by 1. Let's do another example. Let's say I had 7.4 times 10 to the fourth. Well, let's just do this the fast way. Let's shift the decimal 4 to the right. So 7.4 times 10 to the fourth. Times 10 to the 1, you're going to get 74. Then times 10 to the second, you're going to get 740. We're going to have to add a 0 there, because we have to shift the decimal again. 10 to the third, you're going to have 7,400."
Math,"And then 10 to the fourth, you're going to have 74,000. Notice, I just took this decimal and went 1, 2, 3, 4 spaces. So this is equal to 74,000. And when I had 74, and I had to shift the decimal 1 more to the right, I had to throw in a 0 here. I'm multiplying it by 10. Another way to think about it is, I need 10 spaces between the leading digit and the decimal. So right here, I only have 1 space. I'll need 4 spaces, So, 1, 2, 3, 4."
Math,"Let's do a few more examples, because I think the more examples, the more you'll get what's going on. So I have 1.75 times 10 to the negative 3. This is in scientific notation, and I want to just write the numerical value of this. So when you take something to the negative times 10 to the negative power, you shift the decimal to the left. So this is 1.75. So if you do it times 10 to the negative 1 power, you'll go 1 to the left. But if you do times 10 to the negative 2 power, you'll go 2 to the left."
Math,"And you'd have to put a 0 here. And if you do times 10 to the negative 3, you'd go 3 to the left, and you would have to add another 0. So you take this decimal and go 1, 2, 3 to the left. So our answer would be 0.00175 is the same thing as 1.75 times 10 to the negative 3. And another way to check that you got the right answer is if you have a 1 right here, if you count the 1, 1 including the 0's to the right of the decimal should be the same as the negative exponent here."
Math,"So you have 1, 2, 3 numbers behind the decimal. That's the same thing as to the negative 3 power. You're doing 1,000th, so this is 1,000th right there. Let's do another example. Actually let's mix it up. Let's start with something that's written as a numeral and then write it in scientific notation. So let's say I have 120,000. So that's just its numerical value, and I want to write it in scientific notation."
Math,"So this I can write as-- I take the leading digit-- 1.2 times 10 to the-- and I just count how many digits there are behind the leading digit. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 1.2 times 10 to the fifth. And if you want to internalize why that makes sense, 10 to the fifth is 10,000. So 1.2-- 10 to the fifth is 100,000. So it's 1.2 times-- 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. You have five 0's. That's 10 to the fifth. So 1.2 times 100,000 is going to be a 120,000. It's going to be 1 and 1/5 times 100,000, so 120."
Math,"So hopefully that's sinking in. So let's do another one. Let's say the numerical value is 1,765,244. I want to write this in scientific notation, so I take the leading digit, 1, put a decimal sign. Everything else goes behind the decimal. 7, 6, 5, 2, 4, 4. And then you count how many digits there were between the leading digit, and I guess, you could imagine, the first decimal sign. Because you could have numbers that keep going over here. So between the leading digit and the decimal sign."
Math,"And you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 digits. So this is times 10 to the sixth. And 10 to the sixth is just 1 million. So it's 1.765244 times 1 million, which makes sense. Roughly 1.7 times million is roughly 1.7 million. This is a little bit more than 1.7 million, so it makes sense. Let's do another one. How do I write 12 in scientific notation? Same drill. It's equal to 1.2 times-- well, we only have 1 digit between the 1 and the decimal spot, or the decimal point."
Math,"So it's 1.2 times 10 to the first power, or 1.2 times 10, which is definitely equal to 12. Let's do a couple of examples where we're taking 10 to a negative power. So let's say we had 0.00281, and we want to write this in scientific notation. So what you do, is you just have to think, well, how many digits are there to include the leading numeral in the value? So what I mean there is count, 1, 2, 3. So what we want to do is we move the decimal 1, 2, 3 spaces."
Math,"So one way you could think about it is, you can multiply. To move the decimal to the right 3 spaces, you would multiply it by 10 to the third. But if you're multiplying something by 10 to the third, you're changing its values. So we also have to multiply by 10 to the negative 3. Only this way will you not change the value, right? If I multiply by 10 to the 3, times 10 to the negative 2-- 3 minus 3 is 0-- this is just like multiplying it by 1."
Math,"So what is this going to equal? If I take the decimal and I move it 3 spaces to the right, this part right here is going to be equal to 2.81. And then we're left with this one, times 10 to the negative 3. Now, a very quick way to do it is just to say, look, let me count-- including the leading numeral-- how many spaces I have behind the decimal. 1, 2, 3. So it's going to be 2.81 times 10 to the negative 1, 2, 3 power. Let's do one more like that. Let me actually scroll up here. Let's do one more like that."
Math,"Let's say I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-- how many 0's do I have in this problem? Well, I'll just make up something. 0, 2, 7. And you wanted to write that in scientific notation. Well, you count all the digits up to the 2, behind the decimal. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So this is going to be 2.7 times 10 to the negative 8 power. Now let's do another one, where we start with the scientific notation value and we want to go to the numeric value. Just to mix things up."
Math,"So let's say you have 2.9 times 10 to the negative fifth. So one way to think about is, this leading numeral, plus all 0's to the left of the decimal spot, is going to be five digits. So you have a 2 and a 9, and then you're going to have 4 more 0's. 1, 2, 3, 4. And then you're going to have your decimal. And how did I know 4 0's? Because I'm counting,, this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spaces behind the decimal, including the leading numeral. And so it's 0.000029. And just to verify, do the other technique."
Math,"How do I write this in scientific notation? I count all of the digits, all of the leading 0's behind the decimal, including the leading non-zero numeral. So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 digits. So it's 10 to the negative 5. And so it'll be 2.9 times 10 to the negative 5. And once again, this isn't just some type of black magic here. This actually makes a lot of sense. If I wanted to get this number to 2.9, what I would have to do is move the decimal over 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spots, like that."
Math,"And to get the decimal to move over the right by 5 spots-- let's just say with 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9. If I multiply it by 10 to the fifth, I'm also going to have to multiply it by 10 to the negative 5. So I don't want to change the number. This right here is just multiplying something by 1. 10 to the fifth times 10 to the negative 5 is 1. So this right here is essentially going to move the decimal 5 to the right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
Math,"So this will be 2.5, and then we're going to be left with times 10 to the negative 5. Anyway, hopefully, you found that scientific notation drill useful.."
Math,"And I'll start off by trying to simplify this denominator here. So the numerator's just 7 times 10 to the fifth. And the denominator, I just have a bunch of numbers that are being multiplied times each other. So I can do it in any order. So let me swap the order. So I'm going to do over 2 times 2.5 times 10 to the negative 2 times 10 to the ninth."
Math,"And this is going to be equal to-- so the numerator I haven't changed yet-- 7 times 10 to the fifth over-- and here in the denominator, 2 times-- let me do this in a new color now. 2 times 2.5 is 5. And then 10 to the negative 2 times 10 to the ninth, when you multiply two numbers that are being raised to exponents and have the exact same base-- so it's 10 to the negative 2 times 10 to the negative 9-- we can add the exponents. So this is going to be 10 to the 9 minus 2, or 10 to the seventh."
Math,"So times 10 to the seventh. And now we can view this as being equal to 7 over 5 times 10 to the fifth over 10 to the seventh. Let me do that in that orange color to keep track of the colors. 10 to the seventh. Now, what is 7 divided by 5? 7 divided by 5 is equal to-- let's see, it's 1 and 2/5, or 1.4. So I'll just write it as 1.4. And then 10 to the fifth divided by 10 to the seventh. So that's going to be the same thing as-- and there's two ways to view this."
Math,"You could view this as 10 to the fifth times 10 to the negative 7. You add the exponents. You get 10 to the negative 2. Or you say, hey, look, I'm dividing this by this. We have the same base. We can subtract exponents. So it's going to be 10 to the 5 minus 7, which is 10 to the negative 2. So this part right over here is going to simplify to times 10 to the negative 2. Now, are we done? Have we written what we have here in scientific notation? It looks like we have."
Math,"This value right over here is greater than or equal to 1, but it is less than or equal to 9. It's a digit between 1 and 9, including 1 and 9. And it's being multiplied by 10 to some power. So it looks like we're done. This simplified to 1.4 times 10 to the negative 2.."
Math,"and express the product in both decimal and scientific notation. So this is 1.45 times 10 to the eighth power times-- and I could just write the parentheses again like this, but I'm just going to write it as another multiplication-- times 9.2 times 10 to the negative 12th and then times 3.01 times 10 to the negative fifth. All this meant, when I wrote these parentheses times next to each other, I'm just going to multiply this expression times this expression times this expression."
Math,"And since everything is involved multiplication, it actually doesn't matter what order I multiply in. And so with that in mind, I can swap the order here. This is going to be the same thing as 1.45-- that's that right there-- times 9.2 times 3.01 times 10 to the eighth-- let me do that in that purple color-- times 10 to the eighth times 10 to the negative 12th power times 10 to the negative fifth power. And this is useful because now I have all of my powers of 10 right over here."
Math,"I could put parentheses around that. And I have all my non-powers of 10 right over there. And so I can simplify it. If I have the same base 10 right over here, so I can add the exponents. This is going to be 10 to the 8 minus 12 minus 5 power. And then all of this on the left-hand side-- let me get a calculator out-- I have 1.45. You could do it by hand, but this is a little bit faster and less likely to make a careless mistake-- times 9.2 times 3.01, which is equal to 40.1534. So this is equal to 40.1534."
Math,"And of course, this is going to be multiplied times 10 to this thing. And so if we simplify this exponent, you get 40.1534 times 10 to the 8 minus 12 is negative 4, minus 5 is negative 9. 10 to the negative 9 power. Now you might be tempted to say that this is already in scientific notation because I have some number here times some power of 10. But this is not quite official scientific notation."
Math,"And that's because in order for it to be in scientific notation, this number right over here has to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. And this is, obviously, not less than 10. Essentially, for it to be in scientific notation, you want a non-zero digit right over here. And then you want your decimal and then the rest of everything else. So here-- and you want a non-zero single digit over here. Here we obviously have two digits. This is larger than 10-- or this is greater than or equal to 10."
Math,"You want this thing to be less than 10 and greater than or equal to 1. So the best way to do that is to write this thing right over here in scientific notation. This is the same thing as 4.01534 times 10. And one way to think about it is to go from 40 to 4, we have to move this decimal over to the left. Moving a decimal over to the left to go from 40 to 4 you're dividing by 10. So you have to multiply by 10 so it all equals out. Divide by 10 and then multiply by 10."
Math,"Or another way to write it, or another way to think about it, is 4.0 and all this stuff times 10 is going to be 40.1534. And so you're going to have 4-- all of this times 10 to the first power, that's the same thing as 10-- times this thing-- times 10 to the negative ninth power. And then once again, powers of 10, so it's 10 to the first times 10 to the negative 9 is going to be 10 to the negative eighth power. And we still have this 4.01534 times 10 to the negative 8."
Math,"And now we have written it in scientific notation. Now, they wanted us to express it in both decimal and scientific notation. And when they're asking us to write it in decimal notation, they essentially want us to multiply this out, expand this And so the way to think about it-- write these digits out. So I have 4, 0, 1, 5, 3, 4. And if I'm just looking at this number, I start with the decimal right over here."
Math,"Now, every time I divide by 10, or if I multiply by 10 to the negative 1, I'm moving this over to the left one spot. So 10 to the negative 1-- if I multiply by 10 to the negative 1, that's the same thing as dividing by 10. And so I'm moving the decimal over to the left one. Here I'm multiplying by 10 to the negative 8. Or you could say I'm dividing by 10 to the eighth power. So I'm going to want to move the decimal to the left eight times."
Math,"And one way to remember it-- look, this is a very, very, very, very small number. If I multiply this, I should get a smaller number. So I should be moving the decimal to the left. If this was a positive 8, then this would be a very large number. And so if I multiply by a large power of 10, I'm going to be moving the decimal to the right. So this whole thing should evaluate to being smaller than 4.01534. So I move the decimal eight times to the left. I move it one time to the left to get it right over here."
Math,"And then the next seven times, I'm just going to add 0's. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven 0's. And I'll put a 0 in front of the decimal just to clarify it. So now I notice, if you include this digit right over here, I have a total of eight digits. I have seven 0's, and this digit gives us eight. So again, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. The best way to think about it is, I started with the decimal right here. I moved once, twice, three, four, five, six, seven, eight times."
Math,"That's what multiplying times 10 to the negative 8 did for us. And I get this number right over here. And when you see a number like this, you start to appreciate why we rewrite things in scientific notation. This is much easier to-- it takes less space to write and you immediately know roughly how big this number is. This is much harder to write. You might even forget a 0 when you write it or you might add a 0."
Math,"And now the person has to sit and count the 0's to figure out essentially how large--or get a rough sense of how large this thing is. It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven 0's, and you have this digit right here. That's what gets us to that eight. But this is a much, much more complicated-looking number than the one in scientific notation.."
Math,"4.1 x 10 to the -2 power and from that I want to subtract, I want to subtract 2.6, 2.6 x 10 to the -3 power. Like always, I encourage you to pause this video and see if you can solve this on your own and then we could work through it together. All right, I'm assuming you've had a go it. So the easiest thing that I can think of doing is try to convert one of these numbers so that it has the same, it's being multiplied by the same power of ten as the other one."
Math,"What I could think about doing, well can we express 4.1 times 10 to the -2? Can we express it as something times 10 to the -3? So we have 4.1 times 10 to the -2. Well if we want 10 to the -2 to go to 10 to the -3 we would divide by 10, but we can't just divide by 10. That would literally change the value of the number. In order to not change it, we want to multiply by 10 as well. So we're multiplying by 10 and dividing by 10. I could have written it like this."
Math,"I could have written 10/10 times, let me write this a little bit neater. I could have written 10/10 x this and then you take 10 x 4.1, you get 41, and then 10 to the -2 divided by 10 is going to be 10 to the -3. So this right over here, this is equal to 10 x 4.1 is 41 times 10 to the -3. And that makes sense. 41 thousandths is the same thing as 4.1 hundredths and all we did is we multiplied this times 10 and we divided this times 10. So let's rewrite this."
Math,"We can rewrite it now as 41 X 10 to the -3 minus 2.6, -2.6 x 10 to the -3. So now we have two things. We have 41 X 10 to the -3 - 2.6 x 10 to the -3. Well this is going to be the same thing as 41 - 2.6. - 2.6, let me do it in that same color. That was purple. - 2.6, 10 to the -3. 10, whoops, 10 to the -3. There's 10 to the -3 there, 10 to the -3 there. One way to think about it, I have just factored out a 10 to the -3. Now what's 41 - 2.6? Well 41 - 2 is 39, and then -.6 is going to be 38.4."
Math,"38.4 and then you're going to have times 10 to the -3 power. x 10 to the -3 power. Now, this is what the product, or this is what the difference of these two numbers is but this is no longer in scientific notation. In order to be scientific notation this number right over here has to be between 1, has to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. So what we could do is we could divide this number right over here by 10."
Math,"We can divide this by 10 and then we can multiply, then we can multi...so we could do this. We could, kind of the opposite of what we did up here. We could divide this by 10 and then multiply by 10. So if you divide by 10 and multiply by 10 you're not changing the value. So 38.4 divided by 10 is 3.84 and then all of this business, 10 to the -3, 10 to the -3 x 10 is 10 to the -2 power. So this is going to be 3.84 x 10 to the -2 power.."
Math,"So this part right over here, 0.2, is not in scientific notation. In order for it to be scientific notation, it would have to be some number between 1 and 10, not including 10-- so greater than or equal to 1, less than 10-- being multiplied by some power of 10. And this is clearly less than 1. But we could just view this as, look, this is in the tenths place. This is 2 times 1/10. 1/10 is 10 to the negative 1. So this is the same thing as 2 times 10 to the negative 1-- same thing as 2 times 1/10."
Math,"Now if we look in the denominator, in blue, we have this part. It is written in scientific notation. But this green part is not. But we could easily write it as-- this is five 10,000's. 10,000 is 10 to the fourth. So this is the same thing as 5 times 10 to the fourth power. And you see that it has one, two, three, four 0's. So now let's take the product in the numerator and the denominator. So in the numerator, I'm just going to swap the order in which I'm multiplying."
Math,"I'm just multiplying a bunch of stuff. 4.6 times 10 to the sixth times 2 times 10 to the negative 1. It doesn't matter what order I multiply them in. So I could rewrite this as 4.6 times 2 times 2 times 10 to the sixth-- I'm switching colors-- times 10 to the negative 1. And then in the denominator, let me just write the 5 times 2.3 times 10 to the fourth times 10 to the negative 2. And now let us attempt to simplify this thing. So here, we have 4.6 times 2. Let me circle that. So 4.6 times 2 is 9.2."
Math,"So that's 9.2. And then 10 to the sixth times 10 to the negative 1-- we have the same base. We're taking the product. We can add the exponents-- is going to be 10 to the 6 minus 1 or 10 to the fifth power. So we've simplified our numerator. And now in our denominator, let's see. 5 times 2.3-- 5 times 2 is 10. 5 times 0.3 is 1.5, so it's going to be 11.5. So this is going to be 11.5."
Math,"And then if I multiply 10 to the fourth times 10 to the negative 2, that's going to be 10 to the 4 minus 2 or 10 squared-- times 10 to the second power. And now I can divide these two things. So this is going to be equal to-- we'll have to think about what 9.2 over 11.5 is. But actually let me just do that right now, get a little practice dividing decimals. Let me get some real estate here. Let me do that in the same color."
Math,"9.2 divided by 11.5-- well if we multiply both of these times 10, that's the exact same thing as 92 divided by 115. We're essentially moved the decimal to the right for both of them. And let me add some zeros here because I suspect that I'm going to get a decimal here. So let's think what this is going to be. Let's think about this. Well 115 doesn't go into 9. It doesn't go into 92. It does go into 920. And I'm going to eyeball and say that it will go eight times. Let's see if that works out."
Math,"So I have my decimal here. That's a 0. 8 times-- 8 times 5 is 40. 8 times 11 is 88. And then 88 plus 4 is 92. Oh, it went in exactly, very good. So 920, we have no remainder. So 9.2 divided by 11.5 simplified to 0.80. And then 10 to the fifth divided by 10 to the second, we have the same base, and we're dividing. So we can subtract the exponents. That's going to be 10 to the 5 minus 2. So this right over here is going to be 10 to the third power-- so times 10 to the third power."
Math,"Now, are we done? Well in order to be done, this number right over here needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. It is clearly not greater than or equal to 1. So how can we rewrite this as the product of something that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10 and some power of 10? Well this 8 right over here, this is in the tenths place. It's 8/10, 8 times 1/10. So this is going to be the same thing as 8 times 10 to the negative 1 power."
Math,And then we have this 10 to the third here-- so times 10 to the third power. We'll do that in that other color. And now we have the same base. Just add the exponents. So this is going to be equal to 8 times 10 to the 3 minus 1-- so 8 times 10 squared. And we're done. We've simplified our original expression..
Math,"So they tell us the total volume of blood in the human body. We have 5 liters. And then they tell us that 40% of that is red blood cells. So if we take the 5 liters and we multiply by 40%, this expression right here gives us the total volume of the red blood cells, 40% of our total volume of blood. Now this is the total volume of red blood cells. And we divide by the volume of each red blood cell. Then we're going to get the number of red blood cells. So let's do that."
Math,"Let's divide by the volume of each red blood cell. So the volume of each red blood cell is 90 times 10 to the negative 15 liters. So let's see if we can simplify. So one thing that we can feel good about is that the units actually do cancel out. We have liters in the numerator, liters in the denominator, so we're going to get just a pure number, which is what we want. We just want how many red blood cells are actually in the body. So let's just focus the numbers here."
Math,"So 5 times 40%-- well 40% is the same thing as 0.4. So let me write that down. This is the same thing as 0.4. 5 times 0.4 is 2. So our numerator simplifies to 2. And in the denominator, we have 90 times 10 to the negative 15, which definitely is not in scientific notation. It looks like it, but remember, in order to be in scientific notation, this number has to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. It's clearly not less than 10. But we can convert this to scientific notation very easily."
Math,"90 is the same thing as 9 times 10, or you could even say 9 times 10 to the first. And then you multiply that times 10 to the negative 15. And then this simplifies to 9 times-- let's add these two exponents-- 10 to the negative 14. And now we can actually divide. And let's simplify this division a little bit. This is going to be the same thing as 2/9 times 1 to t over 10 to the negative 14. Well what's 1 over 10 to the negative 14? Well that's just 10 to the 14."
Math,"So this right over here is just the same thing as 10 to the 14. Now you might say, OK, we just have to figure out what 2/9 is and we're done. We've written this in scientific notation. But you might have already realized, look, 2/9 is not greater than or equal to 1. How can we make this greater than or equal to 1? Well we could multiply it by 10. If we multiply this by 10, then we've got to divide this by 10 to not change the value of this expression. But let's do that."
Math,"So I'm going to multiply this by 10, and I'm going to divide this by 10. So I haven't changed. I've multiplied and divided by 10. So this is equal to 20/9 times 10 to the 14th divided by 10 is 10 to the 13th power. So what's 20/9? This is going to give us a number that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. So let's figure it out. And I think they said round our answer to two decimal places. So let's do that. So 20 divided by 9-- 9 doesn't go into 2. It does go into 20 two times. 2 times 9 is 18."
Math,"Subtract. Get a remainder of 2. I think you see where this show is going to go. 9 goes into 20 two times. 2 times 9 is 18. We're just going to keep getting 2's. So we get another 2, bring down a 0. Nine goes into 20 two times. So this thing right over here is really 2.2 repeating. But they said round to two decimal places, so this is going to be equal to 2.22 times 10 to the 13th power.."
Math,"And just to get a sense of things, 1 times 10 to the sixth is a million, 1 times 10 to the ninth is a billion, 1 times 10 to the 12th is a trillion. So we're talking on the order of magnitude of 10 trillion dollars. So this is about 12 trillion dollars. Then they tell us that the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate for the U.S. population was about 3.086 times 10 to the eighth power. So this is a little over 300 million people. So that's an interesting number right there, it's the population."
Math,"And then they say, using these estimates calculate the per-person share of the national debt. So essentially, we want to take the entire debt and divide by the number of people. That'll give us the per-person share of the national debt. Use scientific notation to make your calculations and express your answer in both scientific and decimal notation. Which means just as a regular number. Round to four decimal places while making calculations. So we want the per-person debt."
Math,"So we want to take the total debt and divide by the number of people. So the total debt is 1.2278 times 10 to the 13th. And we want to divide that by the total number of people, which is 3.086 times 10 to the eighth. And we could separate this into two division problems. We could say that this is equal to the division right here, 1.2278 divided by 3.086. And then times 10 to the 13th divided by 10 to the eighth. Now, what's 10 to the 13th divided by 10 to the eighth? Let me do it over here."
Math,"The way I think about it, this is the exact same thing as 10 to the 13th times 10 to the negative eight. This is an eight right here. If you have a 10 to the eighth in the denominator, that's like multiplying by 10 to the negative eight. So you have 13, you the same base 10, so 10 to the 13th times 10 to the negative eight is going to be 10 to the 13 minus 8. Which is 10 to the fifth. Or another way to think about it: If you have the base in the denominator, you subtract the exponents. So it's 13 minus 8."
Math,"10 to the fifth. So it's this blue expression times 10 to the fifth. And let's get a calculator out to calculate this right here. And they say round everything to four decimal places, so I'll keep that in mind. Let me turn my calculator on. 1.2278 divided by 3.086 is equal to 0.3979. Because we want to round right there. Let me remember that. Or let me just put it on the side so I can still look at it. So this this little dividing decimals problem results in 0.3979."
Math,"And of course, times 10 to the fifth dollars per person. Once again, you might be tempted to say, hey this is in scientific notation. I have some number times a power of ten. But notice, this number is not greater than or equal to 1. Remember, this number, if you want to be formal about scientific notation, has to be greater than or equal to 1, or less than 10. So what we can do here is we can multiply. If we don't want to change the number, we can multiply this number by 10 and divide this number by 10."
Math,"Or another way you can think about it is, this whole thing can be rewritten as 0.3979 times 10 times 10 to the fourth. What I did was just now was I broke up the 10 of the fifth into a 10 and a 10 to the fourth. And I did that because I want to multiply this by 10 so I can get a 3 out front instead of a 0.3. So let's do that. So essentially, I took a 10 out of the 10 to the fifth. I divided it by 10, I multiplied this other guy by 10, not changing the whole number."
Math,"So then this right here will become 3.979 and then times 10 to the fourth. So that's how much debt there is per-person in scientific notation. So this is debt per person in scientific notation.  Now, in the problem they also wanted us to express it in decimal notation. Which is just kind of standard writing it as a number with our standard numeric decimal system. So what is 3.979 times 10 to the fourth? Let's think about it. We have 3.979 times ten to the fourth. Well let me just do it this way."
Math,"Let's just move the decimal space. If we multiply it by 10, we're going to get 39.79. If we multiply it by 10 squared, we're going to get 397.9. If we multiply it by 10 to the third, we're going to get 3,979. If we multiply it by 10 to the fourth, we're going to get one more zero right there. So we're essentially going to move the decimal four to the right. So I could write it like this. This is equal to $39,790. So if you think about the national debt per person."
Math,"Every man, woman, and child in the United States essentially owes $39,790.."
Math,"5 times 10 to the second, that's 500 seconds. You have 60 seconds in a minute, so 8 minutes would be 480 seconds. So 500 seconds would be about 8 minutes, 20 seconds. It takes 8 minutes, 20 seconds for light to travel from the sun to the earth. What is the distance, in meters, between the sun and the earth? They're giving us a rate. They're giving us a speed. They're giving us a time. And they want to find a distance. This goes straight back to the standard distance is equal to rate times time."
Math,"So they give us the rate. The rate is 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second. That right there is the rate. They give us the time. The time is 5 times 10 to the second seconds. I'll just use that with a S. How many meters? So what is the distance? And so we can just move these around from the commutative and the associative properties of multiplication. And actually, you can multiply the units. That's called dimensional analysis. When you multiply the units, you kind of treat them like variables."
Math,"You should get the right dimensions for distance. So let's just rearrange these numbers. This is equal to 3 times 5-- I'm just commuting and reassociating these numbers and this product, because we're just multiplying everything-- 3 times 5 times 10 to the eighth times 10 to the second. And then we're going to have meters per second times seconds."
Math,"And if you treated these like variables, these seconds would cancel out with that seconds right there, and you would just be left with the unit meters, which is good, because we want a distance in just meters. How does this simplify? This gives us 3 times 5 is 15. 15 times 10 to the eighth times 10 squared. We have the same base. We're taking the product, so we can add the exponents. This is going to be 10 to the 8 plus 2 power, or 10 to the 10th power."
Math,"Now you might be tempted to say that we're done, that we have this in scientific notation. But remember, in scientific notation this number here has to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. This clearly is not less than 10. So how do we rewrite this? We can write 15 as 1.5. This clearly is greater than 1 and less than 10. And to get from 1.5 to 15, you have to multiply by 10. One way to think about it is 15 is 15.0, and so you have a decimal here."
Math,"If we're moving the decimal one to the left to make it 1.5, that's essentially dividing by 10. Moving the decimal to the left means you're dividing by 10. If we don't want to change the value of the number, we need to divide by 10 and then multiply by 10. So this and that are the same number. Now 15 is 1.5 times 10, and then we have to multiply that times 10 to the 10th power, this right over here. 10 is really just 10 to the first power. So we can just add the exponents. Same base, taking the product."
Math,"This is equal to 1.5 times 10 to the 1 plus 10 power, or 10 to the 11th power. And we are done. This is a huge distance. It's very hard to visualize. But anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that.."
Math,"We have x's on both sides of the equation. We're adding and subtracting numbers. How do you solve it? And we'll do it in a couple of different ways. The the important thing to remember is, we just want to isolate an x. Once you've isolated an x, you have x equals something. Or x equals something. You're done, you've solved the equation."
Math,"You can actually go back and check whether that works, So what we're going to do is just do a bunch of operations on both sides of the equation, to eventually isolate the x. But while we do those, I actually want to visualize what's occurring. Because I don't want you just say, oh what are the rules or the steps of solving equations. And I forgot whether this is a allowed or that isn't allowed. If you visualize what's happening, it'll actually be common sense what's allowed. So let's visualize it."
Math,"So we have 2x right here on the left-hand side. So that's literally, that's x plus x. And then you have plus 3. Plus 3, I'll do it like this. So that's equal to plus 1, plus 1, plus 1. That's the same thing as 3. I could've drawn 3 circles here as well. Let do the same color. Plus 3. And then that is equal to 5 x's. Do that in blue. That is equal to 5 x's. So, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. And I want to make it clear. You would never actually have to do it this way when you're solving the problem."
Math,"You would just have to do the algebraic steps. But I'm doing this for you so you can actually visualize what this equation is saying. the left-hand side is these two orange x's plus 3. The right-hand side is 5x minus 2. So minus 2, we could write as -- so let me do this in a different color, I'll do it in pink. So, minus 2, I'll do as minus 1 and minus 1. Now, we want to isolate the x's on the same side of the equation. So, how could we do that? Well, there's two ways of doing it."
Math,"We could subtract these two x's from both sides of the equation. And that would be pretty reasonable. Because then you'd have 5 x's minus the 2 x's. You'd have a positive number of x's on the right-hand side. Or, you could actually subtract 5x from both sides. And that's what's neat about algebra. As long as you do legitimate operations, you will eventually get the right answer. So let's just start off subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation."
Math,"And what I mean there, I mean we're going to remove 2 x's from the left-hand side. And if we were to move 2 x's on the left-hand side, we have to remove 2 x's the right-hand side. Just like that. So what does that give us? We're subtracting 2 x's. 2 x's from the left. And we're also going to subtract 2 x's from the right. Now, what does our left-hand side simplify to? We have 2x plus 3 minus 2x. The 2 x's cancel out. So you're just left with -- you're just left with the 3. And you see that over here."
Math,"We took 2 of these x's away. We're just left with the plus 1, plus 1, plus 1. And then on the right-hand side, 5x minus 2x. We have it over here. We have 5 x's minus 2 x's. You only have 1, 2, 3, x's left over. 3 is equal to 3x. And then you have your minus 2 there. You have your minus 2. So, normally if you were to do the problem, you would just have to write what we have here on the left-hand side. So what can we do next? Remember, we want to isolate the x's."
Math,"Well, we have all of our x's on the right-hand side right here. If we could get rid of this negative 2, off of the right-hand side, then the x's will be alone. They'll be isolated. So how can we get rid of this negative 2, if we visualize it over here. This negative 1, this negative 1. Well, we could add 2 to both sides of this equation. Think about what happens there. So, if we add 2, so I'm going to do it like this. Plus 1, plus 1. So you could literally see. We're adding 2."
Math,"And then we're going to add 2 to the left-hand side. 1 plus, 1 plus. What happens? Let me do it over here as well. So we're going to add 2. We're going to add 2. So what happens to the left-hand side? 3 plus 2 is going to be equal to 5. And that is going to be equal to 3x minus 2 plus 2. These guys cancel out. And you're just left with 3x. And we see it over here. We have the left-hand side is 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1. We have 5 1's, or 5. And the right-hand side, we have the 3 x's, right over there."
Math,"And then we have the negative 1, negative 1. Plus 1, plus 1, negative 1, these cancel out. They get us to 0. They cancel out. So we're just left with 5 is equal to 3x. So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is equal to 3x. Let me clear everything that we've removed, so it looks a little bit cleaner. These are all of the things that we've removed. Let me clear that out. And then let me clear that out, like that. Clear. So now we are just left with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Actually, let me move this over."
Math,"So I could just move this over right over here. We now have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. These are the two that we added here, is equal to 3x. These guys canceled out. That's why we have nothing there. Now, to solve this, we just divide both sides of this equation by 3. And this is going to be a little hard to visualize over here. But if we divide over here both sides by 3, what do we get? We divide the left by 3. We divide the right by 3. The whole reason why we divided by 3 is because the x was being multiplied by 3."
Math,"3 is the coefficient on the x. Fancy word, it literally just means the number multiplying the variable. The number we're solving, the variable we're solving for. So these 3's cancel out. The right-hand side of the equation is just x. The left-hand side is 5/3. So 5/3, we could say is is equal to 5/3. And this is different than everything we've seen so far. I now have the x on the right-hand side, the value on the left-hand side. That's completely fine."
Math,"This is the exact same thing as saying 5/3 is is equal to x is the same thing as saying x's equal to 5/3. Completely equivalent. Completely equivalent. We sometimes get more used to this one, but this is completely the same thing. Now, if we wanted to write this as a mixed number, if we want to write this as a mixed number, 3 goes into 5 one time with remainder 2. So it's going to be 1 2/3. So it's going to be 1 2/3. So we could also write that x is equal to 1 2/3."
Math,"And I'll leave it up for you to actually substitute back into this original equation. And see that it works out. Now, to visualize it over here, you know, how did he get 1 2/3, let's think about it. Instead of doing 1, I'm going to do circles. I am going to do circles. Actually, even better, I'm going to do squares. So I'm going to have 5 squares on the left-hand side. I'll do it in this same yellow color right here. So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And that is going to be equal to the 3 x's. x plus x plus x."
Math,"Now, we're dividing both sides of the equation by 3. We're dividing both sides of the equation by 3. Actually, that's where we did it up here, we divided both sides by 3. So how do you do that right-hand side's pretty straightforward. You want to divide these 3 x's into 3 groups. That's 1, 2, 3 groups. 1, 2, 3. Now, how do you divide 5 into 3? And they have to be thought through even groups. And the answer tells us. Each group is going to be 1 2/3. So, 1 2/3. So it's going to be 2/3 of this, the next one."
Math,"And then we're going to have 1 2/3. So this is 1/3. We're going to need another. Another 1, so this is 1 1/3. We're going to need 1 more 1/3, so this is going to be right here. And then we're left with 2/3 and 1. So we've broken it up into 3 groups. This right here. Let me make it clear. Let me make it clear, this right here is 1 2/3. 1 2/3. And then this right here, this 1/3. That's another 1/3, so that's 2/3, and then that's 1 right there. So that's 1 2/3."
Math,"And then finally this is 2/3 and this is 1, so this is 1 2/3. So when you divide both sides by 3 you get 1 2/3. Each section, each bucket, is 1 2/3 on the left-hand side. On the left-hand side, or 5/3. And on the right-hand side we just have an x. So it still works. A little bit harder to visualize with fractions.."
Math,"I'll put them on the right-hand side. And then we'll put all the x terms, the negative 7x and the 6x, we'll put it all on the left-hand side. So to get the 20 out of the way from the left-hand side, let's subtract it. Let's subtract it from the left-hand side. But this is an equation, anything you do to the left-hand side, you also have to do to the right-hand side. If that is equal to that, in order for them to still be equal, anything I do to the left-hand side I have to do to the right-hand side."
Math,"So I subtracted 20 from the left, let me also subtract 20 from the right. And so the left-hand side of the equation, 20 minus 20 is just 0. That was the whole point, they cancel out. Don't have to write it down. And then I have a negative 7x, it just gets carried down. And then that is equal to the right-hand side of the equation. I have a 6x. I'm not adding or subtracting anything to that. But then I have a negative 6 minus 20."
Math,"So if I'm already 6 below 0 on the number line, and I go another 20 below that, that's at negative 26. Now, the next thing we want to do is we want to get all the x terms on the left-hand side. So we don't want this 6x here, so maybe we subtract 6x from both sides. So let's subtract 6x from the right, subtract 6x from the left, and what do we get? The left-hand side, negative 7x minus 6x, that's negative 13x."
Math,"Right? Negative 7 of something minus another 6 of that something is going to be negative 13 of that something. And that is going to be equal to 6x minus 6x. That cancels out. That was the whole point by subtracting negative 6x. And then we have just a negative 26, or minus 26, depending on how you want to view it, so negative 13x is equal to negative 26. Now, our whole goal, just to remember, is to isolate the x. We have a negative 13 times the x here."
Math,"So the best way to isolate it is if we have something times x, if we divide by that something, we'll isolate the x. So let's divide by negative 13. Now, you know by now, anything you do to the left-hand side of an equation, you have to do to the right-hand side. So we're going to have to divide both sides of the equation by negative 13. Now, what does the left-hand side become? Negative 13 times x divided by negative 13, that's just going to be x."
Math,"You multiply something times x, divide it by the something, you're just going to be left with an x. So the left-hand side just becomes an x. x is equal to negative 26 divided by negative 13. Well, that's just positive 2, right? A negative divided by a negative is a positive. 26 divided by 13 is 2. And that is our answer. That is our answer. Now let's verify that it really works. That's the fun thing about algebra. You can always make sure that you got the right answer."
Math,"So let's substitute it back into the original equation. So we have 20 minus 7 times x-- x is 2-- minus 7 times 2 is equal to 6 times x-- we've solved for x, it is 2-- minus 6. So let's verify that this left-hand side really does equal this right-hand side. So the left-hand side simplifies to 20 minus 7 times 2, which is 14. 20 minus 14 is 6. That's what the left-hand side simplifies to. The right-hand side, we have 6 times 2, which is 12 minus 6. 12 minus 6 is 6."
Math,"So they are, indeed, equal, and we did, indeed, get the right answer.."
Math,"So what I'm going to do, right from the start of this video, is to multiply both sides of this equation by some number so I can get rid of the fractions. And the best number to do it by-- what number is the smallest number that if I multiply both of these fractions by it, they won't be fractions anymore, they'll be whole numbers? That smallest number is going to be 8. I'm going to multiply 8 times both sides of this equation."
Math,"You say, hey, Sal, how did you get 8? And I got 8 because I said, well, what's the least common multiple of 4 and 8? Well, the smallest number that is divisible by 4 and 8 is 8. So when you multiply by 8, it's going to get rid of the fractions. And so let's see what happens. So 8 times 3/4, that's the same thing as 8 times 3 over 4. Let me do it on the side over here. That's the same thing as 8 times 3 over 4, which is equal to 8 divided by 4 is just 2. So it's 2 times 3, which is 6."
Math,"So the left-hand side becomes 8 times 3/4x is 6x. And then 8 times 2 is 16. You have to remember, when you multiply both sides, or a side, of an equation by a number, you multiply every term by that number. So you have to distribute the 8. So the left-hand side is 6x plus 16 is going to be equal to-- 8 times 3/8, that's pretty easy, the 8's cancel out and you're just left with 3x. And then 8 times negative 4 is negative 32. And now we've cleaned up the equation a good bit."
Math,"Now the next thing, let's try to get all the x terms on the left-hand side, and all the constant terms on the right. So let's get rid of this 3x from the right. Let's subtract 3x from both sides to do it. That's the best way I can think of of getting rid of the 3x from the right. The left-hand side of this equation, 6x minus 3x is 3x. 6 minus 3 is 3. And then you have a plus 16 is equal to-- 3x minus 3x, that's the whole point of subtracting 3x, is so they cancel out."
Math,"So those guys cancel out, and we're just left with a negative 32. Now, let's get rid of the 16 from the left-hand side. So to get rid of it, we're going to subtract 16 from both sides of this equation. Subtract 16 from both sides. The left-hand side of the equation just becomes-- you have this 3x here; these 16's cancel out, you don't have to write anything-- is equal to negative 32 minus 16 is negative 48. So we have 3x is equal to negative 48."
Math,"To isolate the x, we can just divide both sides of this equation by 3. So let's divide both sides of that equation by 3. The left-hand side of the equation, 3x divided by 3 is just an x. That was the whole point behind dividing both sides by 3. And the right-hand side, negative 48 divided by 3 is negative 16. And we are done. x equals negative 16 is our solution. So let's make sure that this actually works by substituting to the original equation up here."
Math,"And the original equation didn't have those 8's out front. So let's substitute in the original equation. We get 3/4-- 3 over 4-- times negative 16 plus 2 needs to be equal to 3/8 times negative 16 minus 4. So 3/4 of 16 is 12. And you can think of it this way. What's 16 divided by 4? It is 4. And then multiply that by 3, it's 12, just multiplying fractions. So this is going to be a negative 12. So we get negative 12 plus 2 on the left-hand side, negative 12 plus 2 is negative 10."
Math,"So the left-hand side is a negative 10. Let's see what the right-hand side is. You have 3/8 times negative 16. If you divide negative 16 by 8, you get negative 2, times 3 is a negative 6. So it's a negative 6 minus 4. Negative 6 minus 4 is negative 10. So when x is equal to negative 16, it does satisfy the original equation. Both sides of the equation become negative 10. And we are done.."
Math,"Well, what we'll see is we can do a quick multiplication of both sides to actually simplify this to a form that we are more used to looking at. So what's probably bothering you, because it's bothering me, is these x's that we have in the denominators right over here. We're like, well, how do we deal with that? Well, whenever we see an x in the denominator, the temptation is to multiply it by x. But we can't just multiply one of the terms by x. We have to multiply the entire side by x."
Math,"So we could multiply this entire side by x. But we can't just multiply the left-hand side by x. We'd also want to multiply the right-hand side by x. And so what will that give us? Well, we distribute the x. We get x times 7 is 7x. And then x times negative 10/x, well, that's just going to be negative 10. So you get negative 10 right over there. So the left-hand side simplifies to 7x minus 10. And then your right-hand side, once again, distribute the x. x times 2 is 2x."
Math,"x times 15/x, well, x times something over x is just going to be the something. x times 15/x is just going to be 15-- plus 15. So now we've simplified this to a linear equation. We have the variable on both sides. So we just have to do some of the techniques that we already know. So the first thing that I like to do is maybe get all my x's on the left-hand side. So I want to get rid of this 2x right over here. So I subtract 2x from the right-hand side."
Math,"Now, and I always remind you, I can't do that just to the right-hand side. If I did it just to the right-hand side, it wouldn't be an equality anymore. You have to do that to the left-hand side as well. And so we are left with-- let me get that pink color again. On the left-hand side, 7x, 7 of something minus 2 of something, well, you're going to have 5 of that something, minus 10. These two x's negate each other. And you're left with equals 15."
Math,"Now we can get rid of this negative 10 by adding 10 to both sides. You know, I like that green color when I do stuff to both sides. So I can add 10 to both sides. And I'm left with 5x-- these negate each other-- is equal to 25. And this is the home stretch. You see where this is going. We can divide both sides by 5. And we are left with x is equal to 5. Now let's verify that this actually worked. So let's go back to the original equation. We have 7 minus 10/5."
Math,"This needs to be equal to-- I'm just taking our 5 and substituting it back here. This needs to be equal to 2 plus 15/5. So this is 7 minus 10/5. This is just 2. It needs to be equal to 2 plus 15/5, which is just 3. So 2 plus 3, 7 minus 2 is 5, 2 plus 3 is 5, 5 is indeed equal to 5. And we are done.."
Math,"This has a negative 1-- you just see a minus here, but it's just really the same thing as having a negative 1-- times this quantity. And here you have a 3 times this quantity. So let's multiply it out using the distributive property. So the left-hand side of our equation, we have our negative 9. And then we want to multiply the negative 1 times each of these terms. So negative 1 times 9x is negative 9x, and then negative 1 times negative 6 is plus 6, or positive 6."
Math,"And then that is going to be equal to-- let's distribute the 3-- 3 times 4x is 12x. And then 3 times 6 is 18. Now what we want to do, let's combine our constant terms, if we can. We have a negative 9 and a 6 here, on this side, we've combined all of our like terms. We can't combine a 12x and an 18, so let's combine this. So let's combine the negative 9 and the 6, our two constant terms on the left-hand side of the equation. So we're going to have this negative 9x."
Math,"So we're going to have negative 9x plus-- let's see, we have a negative 9 and then plus 6-- so negative 9 plus 6 is negative 3. So we're going to have a negative 9x, and then we have a negative 3, so minus 3 right here. That's the negative 9 plus the 6, and that is equal to 12x plus 18. Now, we want to group all the x terms on one side of the equation, and all of the constant terms-- the negative 3 and the positive 18 on the other side-- I like to always have my x terms on the left-hand side, if I can."
Math,"You don't have to have them on the left, so let's do that. So if I want all my x terms on the left, I have to get rid of this 12x from the right. And the best way to do that is to subtract 12x from both sides of the equation. So let me subtract 12x from the right, and subtract 12x from the left. Now, on the left-hand side, I have negative 9x minus 12x. So negative 9 minus 12, that's negative 21. Negative 21x minus 3 is equal to-- 12x minus 12x, well, that's just nothing. That's 0."
Math,"So I could write a 0 here, but I don't have to write anything. That was the whole point of subtracting the 12x from the left-hand side. And that is going to be equal to-- so on the right-hand side, we just are left with an 18. We are just left with that 18 here. These guys canceled out. Now, let's get rid of this negative 3 from the left-hand side. So on the left-hand side, we only have x terms, and on the right-hand side, we only have constant terms. So the best way to cancel out a negative 3 is to add 3."
Math,"So it cancels out to 0. So we're going to add 3 to the left, let's add 3 to the right. And we get-- the left-hand side of the equation, we have the negative 21x, no other x term to add or subtract here, so we have negative 21x. The negative 3 and the plus 3, or the positive 3, cancel out-- that was the whole point-- equals-- what's 18 plus 3? 18 plus 3 is 21. So now we have negative 21x is equal to 21. And we want to solve for x."
Math,"So if you have something times x, and you just want it to be an x, let's divide by that something. And in this case, that something is negative 21. So let's divide both sides of this equation by negative 21. Divide both sides by negative 21. The left-hand side, negative 21 divided by negative 21, you're just left with an x. That was the whole point behind dividing by negative 21. And we get x is equal to-- what's 21 divided by negative 21? Well, that's just negative 1."
Math,"Right? You have the positive version divided by the negative version of itself, so it's just negative 1. So that is our answer. Now let's verify that this actually works for that original equation. So let's substitute negative 1 into that original equation. So we have negative 9-- I'll do it over here; I'll do it in a different color than we've been using-- we have negative 9 minus-- that 1 wasn't there originally, it's there implicitly-- minus 9 times negative 1."
Math,"9 times-- I'll put negative 1 in parentheses-- minus 6 is equal to-- well, actually, let me just solve for the left-hand side when I substitute a negative 1 there. So the left-hand side becomes negative 9, minus 9 times negative 1 is negative 9, minus 6. And so this is negative 9 minus-- in parentheses-- negative 9 minus 6 is negative 15. So this is equal to negative 15. And so we get negative 9-- let me make sure I did that-- negative 9 minus 6, yep, negative 15."
Math,"So negative 9 minus negative 15, that's the same thing as negative 9 plus 15, which is 6. So that's what we get on the left-hand side of the equation when we substitute x is equal to negative 1. We get that it equals 6. So let's see what happens when we substitute negative 1 to the right-hand side of the equation. I'll do it in green. We get 3 times 4 times negative 1 plus 6. So that is 3 times negative 4 plus 6. Negative 4 plus 6 is 2. So it's 3 times 2, which is also 6."
Math,"So when x is equal to negative 1, you substitute here, the left-hand side becomes 6, and the right-hand side becomes 6. So this definitely works out.."
Math,"Let's say x is equal to-- if I want to say the abstract-- x is equal to a. Or if we actually were to solve it, we'd get something like x equals 5 or 10 or negative pi-- whatever it might be. But if you could actually solve for a specific x, then you have one solution. So this is one solution, just like that. Now if you go and you try to manipulate these equations in completely legitimate ways, but you end up with something crazy like 3 equals 5, then you have no solutions."
Math,"And if you just think about it reasonably, all of these equations are about finding an x that satisfies this. And if you were to just keep simplifying it, and you were to get something like 3 equals 5, and you were to ask yourself the question is there any x that can somehow magically make 3 equal 5, no. No x can magically make 3 equal 5, so there's no way that you could make this thing be actually true, no matter which x you pick."
Math,"So if you get something very strange like this, this means there's no solution. On the other hand, if you get something like 5 equals 5-- and I'm just over using the number 5. It didn't have to be the number 5. It could be 7 or 10 or 113, whatever. And actually let me just not use 5, just to make sure that you don't think it's only for 5. If I just get something, that something is equal to itself, which is just going to be true no matter what x you pick, any x you pick, this would be true for."
Math,"Well, then you have an infinite solutions. So with that as a little bit of a primer, let's try to tackle these three equations. So over here, let's see. Maybe we could subtract. If we want to get rid of this 2 here on the left hand side, we could subtract 2 from both sides. If we subtract 2 from both sides, we are going to be left with-- on the left hand side we're going to be left with negative 7x. And on the right hand side, you're going to be left with 2x. This is going to cancel minus 9x."
Math,"2x minus 9x, If we simplify that, that's negative 7x. You get negative 7x is equal to negative 7x. And you probably see where this is going. This is already true for any x that you pick. Negative 7 times that x is going to be equal to negative 7 times that x. So we already are going into this scenario. But you're like hey, so I don't see 13 equals 13. Well, what if you did something like you divide both sides by negative 7. At this point, what I'm doing is kind of unnecessary."
Math,"You already understand that negative 7 times some number is always going to be negative 7 times that number. But if we were to do this, we would get x is equal to x, and then we could subtract x from both sides. And then you would get zero equals zero, which is true for any x that you pick. Zero is always going to be equal to zero. So any of these statements are going to be true for any x you pick. So for this equation right over here, we have an infinite number of solutions."
Math,"Let's think about this one right over here in the middle. So once again, let's try it. I'll do it a little bit different. I'll add this 2x and this negative 9x right over there. So we will get negative 7x plus 3 is equal to negative 7x. So 2x plus 9x is negative 7x plus 2. Well, let's add-- why don't we do that in that green color. Let's do that in that green color. Plus 2, this is 2. Now let's add 7x to both sides. Well if you add 7x to the left hand side, you're just going to be left with a 3 there."
Math,"And if you add 7x to the right hand side, this is going to go away and you're just going to be left with a 2 there. So all I did is I added 7x. I added 7x to both sides of that equation. And now we've got something nonsensical. I don't care what x you pick, how magical that x might be. There's no way that that x is going to make 3 equal to 2. So in this scenario right over here, we have no solutions. There's no x in the universe that can satisfy this equation. Now let's try this third scenario."
Math,"So once again, maybe we'll subtract 3 from both sides, just to get rid of this constant term. So we're going to get negative 7x on the left hand side. On the right hand side, we're going to have 2x minus 1. And now we can subtract 2x from both sides. To subtract 2x from both sides, you're going to get-- so subtracting 2x, you're going to get negative 9x is equal to negative 1. Now you can divide both sides by negative 9. And you are left with x is equal to 1/9. So we're in this scenario right over here."
Math,"We very explicitly were able to find an x, x equals 1/9, that satisfies this equation. So this right over here has exactly one solution.."
Math,"But before we do that, we can actually simplify each of these sides. On the left-hand side, we can multiply the quantity 3x plus 10 times 8. So we're essentially just distributing the 8, the distributive property right here. So this is the same thing as 8 times 3x, which is 24x, plus 8 times 10, which is 80, is equal to-- and over here, we have 28x minus 14 minus 4x. So we can combine the 28x and the minus 4x. If we have 28x minus 4x, that is 24x And then you have the minus 14 right over here."
Math,"Now, the next thing we could-- and it's already looking a little bit suspicious, but just to confirm that it's as suspicious as it looks, let's try to subtract 24x from both sides of this equation. And if we do that, we see that we actually remove the x's from both sides of the equation because we have a 24x there, and we have a 24x there. You might say, hey, let's put all the x's on the left-hand side. So let's get rid of this 24x."
Math,"So you subtract 24x right over there, but you have to do it to the left-hand side as well. On the left-hand side, these guys cancel out, and you're left with just 80-- these guys cancel out as well-- is equal to a negative 14. Now, this looks very bizarre. It's making a statement that 80 is equal to negative 14, which we know is not true. This does not happen. 80 is never equal to negative 14. They're just inherently inequal. So this equation right here actually has no solution. This has no solution."
Math,There is a no x-value that will make 80 equal to negative 14..
Math,"One, they want us to-- we can pick the coefficient on the x term and then we can pick the constant. So if we made this negative 11x, so now we have a negative 11x on both sides. Here on the left hand side, we have negative 11x plus 4. If we do something other than 4 here, so if we did say negative 11x minus 11, then here we're not going to have any solutions. And you say, hey, Sal how did you come up with that? Well think about it right over here. We have a negative 11x here, we have a negative 11x there."
Math,"If you wanted to solve it algebraically you could add 11x to both sides and both of these terms will cancel out with each other and all you would be left with is a 4 is equal to a negative 11, which is not possible for any x that you pick. Another way that you think about it is here we have negative 11 times some number and we're adding 4 to it, and here we're taking negative 11 times that same number and we're subtracting 11 from it."
Math,"So if you take a negative 11 times some number and on one side you add four, and on the other side you subtract 11, there's no way, it doesn't matter what x you pick. There's no x for which that is going to be true. But let's check our answer right over here.."
Math,"So right over here, if I distribute the 4 over x minus 2, I get 4x minus 8. And then I'm adding x to that. And that's, of course, going to be equal to 5x plus blank. And I get to pick what my blank is. And so 4x plus x is 5x. And of course, we still have our minus 8. And that's going to be equal to 5x plus blank. So what could we make that blank so this is true for any x we pick? Well, over here we have 5 times an x minus 8."
Math,"Well, if we make this a minus 8, or if we subtract 8 here, or if we make this a negative 8, this is going to be true for any x. So if we make this a negative 8, this is going to be true for any x you pick. You give me any x, you multiply it by 5 and subtract 8, that's, of course, going to be that same x multiplied by 5 and subtracting 8."
Math,"And if you were to try to somehow solve this equation, subtract 5x from both sides, you would get negative 8 is equal to negative 8, which is absolutely true for absolutely any x that you pick. So let's go-- let me actually fill this in on the exercise. So I want to make 5-- it's going to be 5x plus negative 8.."
Math,"The next odd integer-- so we want consecutive odd integers. So we want the next odd integer-- would be 5. Then the one after that would be 7, and the one after that would be 9. These are consecutive odd integers. Another example-- we could start at 11. Then the next odd integer is 13. The next one is 15. The next one is 17. The example of non-consecutive odd integers, if someone went from 3 straight to 7, these are not consecutive. The next odd integer after 3 is 5, not 7."
Math,"So these are examples of consecutive odd integers. These are not consecutive odd integers. So with that out of the way, let's actually try to tackle this question. And I encourage you to pause this video right now and try to tackle this on your own before I take a go at it. Well as you can imagine, a little bit of algebra might be handy here. So let's let x be equal to the smallest of the four."
Math,"So if x is the smallest of the four consecutive odd integers, how can we express the other three in terms of x? We'll just use these examples right over here. If that is x, then how would we express this in terms of x? Well, this would be x plus 2. The next odd integer is going to be the previous odd integer plus 2. You're essentially skipping the next number, which is going to be even. So if you added 1, you'd just get to an even number, so you have to add 2 to get to the next odd one."
Math,"Well if you add 2 again, if you add 2 to x plus 2, well now you get to x plus 4. You add 2 to that. You get to x plus 6. And you see that again right over here. If this was x, then this is x plus 2. This is x plus 4, and this is x plus 6. So in general, if x is the smallest of the integers, we can define the other three as x plus 2, x plus 4, and x plus 6. And let's take the sum of them and set that equal to 136 and then solve for x. So the smallest one is x."
Math,"Now the next smallest one is going to be x plus 2. Now the one after that's going to be x plus 4, and then the one after that is going to be x plus 6. So this is the sum of the four consecutive odd integers, and they tell us that that is going to be equal to 136. This is equal to 136. And now we can just literally solve for x. We have this one unknown here. So let's add these x terms together. So we have one x, two x's, three x's, four x's. So we can rewrite those literally as 4x."
Math,"And then we have 2 plus 4, which is 6, plus another 6 is 12. 4x plus 12 is equal to 136. So to solve for x, a good starting point would be to just to isolate the x terms on one side of the equation or try to get rid of this 12. Well to get rid of that 12, we'd want to subtract 12 from the left-hand side. But we can't just do it from the left-hand side. Then this equality wouldn't hold anymore."
Math,"If these two things were equal before subtracting the 12, well then if we want to keep them equal, if we want the left and the right to stay equal, we've got to subtract 12 from both sides. So subtracting 12 from both sides gives us, well on the left-hand side, we're just left with 4x. And on the right-hand side, we are left with 136 minus 12 is 124. Did I do that right? Yeah, 124. So what is x? Well, we just divide both sides by 4 to solve for x."
Math,"And we get-- do that in the same, original color-- x is equal to 124 divided by 4. So let's see. 100 divided by 4 is 25. 24 divided by 4 is 6. 25 plus 6 is 31. And if you don't feel like doing that in your head, you could also, of course, do traditional long division. Goes into 124-- 4 doesn't go into 1. 4 goes into 12 three times. 3 times 4 is 12. You subtract, bring down the next 4. 4 goes into 4 one time. You get no remainder. So x is equal to 31. So x is the smallest of the four integers."
Math,"So this right over here, x is 31. x plus 2 is going to be 33. x plus 4 is going to be 35. And x plus 6 is going to be 37. So our four consecutive odd integers are 31, 33, 35, and 37.."
Math,"x is equal to the smallest odd of these three. It's not the smallest odd integer of all integers, it's is the smallest odd of these three, the smallest odd integer. So what's the next one going to be? Well, if I have one odd integer, what's going to be the next odd integer? Let's think about this. If x was 3, what's the next odd integer? It's 5. And then what's the next one after that? It's 7. And the next one after that? It's 9. So every time we add 2."
Math,"So if the smallest one is x, the next smallest odd integer is x plus 2, is equal to the next smallest odd integer-- I'll write integer here-- odd integer. And then what would be the next one? Well, we're going to add 2 to this one, right? So it's going to be x plus 4. Think about it. If the smallest is 3, then you have x plus 2, which is 5. And then you have x plus 4, which is 7. So this will be the largest of the consecutive odd integer in this group."
Math,"And they tell us that the sum of these consecutive odd integers is 231. What is the largest integer? So if I take x, x plus 2 and x plus 4, and I sum them, they should be equal to 231. So let's do that. So we have x plus x plus 2, plus x plus 4, and this needs to be equal to 231. And when they ask us what's the largest one, we're going to have to tell them what x plus 4 is equal to. So let's just solve this equation. So let's add our x terms."
Math,"We have one x, two x, three x's, so we get 3x plus-- and then what are our constants? We have a 2 and we have a 4. So 3x plus 6 is equal to 231. Now, let's get rid of the 6 from the left-hand side of the equation. The best way to do that it is to subtract 6 from both sides. So let's subtract 6 from both sides. The left-hand side, we're just left with the 3x. The 6's cancel out. The right-hand side, 231 minus 6 is 225. We have 3x is equal to 225. To isolate the x, let's just divide both sides by 3."
Math,"The left-hand side, the 3's cancel out-- that was the whole point behind dividing by 3-- we get just an x is being equal to-- and 225 divided by 3. Let me do it over here. So 3 goes into 225. It goes into 22 7 times. 7 times 3 is 21. 22 minus 21 is 1. Bring down the 5. 3 goes into 15 5 times. 5 times 3 is 15. Subtract, no remainder. So 225 divided by 3 is 75. So the smallest, the smallest of the odd integers is 75. So this one is 75."
Math,"What's x plus 2 going to be equal to? Well, that's going to be 2 more, 77. And what's x plus 4 going to be equal to? Well, that's the largest of them. x is 75 plus 4 is going to be 79. And notice, we have three odd integers. They're consecutive. They're the, you know, they're the odd integers that come directly after each other. And let's verify that when we add them up, we get 231. So if we get 75 plus-- let me just write it like this-- 75 plus 77, plus 79, want to add them all up. 5 plus 7 is 12."
Math,"12 plus 9 is 21. Carry the 2. 2 plus 7 is 9. 9 plus 7 is 16. 16 plus 7 is 23. So there you have it. The three consecutive odd integers, when you add them up, you got 231. They're consecutive and odd. They ask, what's the largest? The largest is 79.."
Math,"I'm assuming they're asking us about the unit rate at which y changes with respect to x. Or how much does y change for a change of 1 in x, the unit rate. And over here, you see when x changes 1, y is going to change by 6.5. Every time x increases by 1, y is going to increase by 6.5. Or you could say the unit rate of change of y with respect to x is 6.5 for every 1 change in x. In this graph right over here, as x changes 1, as x increases 1, y increases it looks like by about 3 and 1/2."
Math,"x increases by 1, y increases by 3 and 1/2. So the unit rate of change here of y with respect to x is 3 and 1/2 for every unit increase in x. So this line is increasing at a slower rate than this equation. Or y in this line is increasing at a slower rate with respect to x than y is increasing with respect to x in this equation right over here. So the unit rate of the graph is less than the unit rate of the equation.."
Math,"All right, which of the following equations, where x represents hours, and y represents miles, represents a speed that is greater than Maria and Nadia's speed? Select all that apply. So let's think about what's happening here. So on day one, they travel for 4 hours and they go 240 miles. So if we wanted to figure out their speed, you would figure out distance divided by time. So they travel 240 miles in 4 hours. 240 miles divided by 4 hours is 60 miles per hour. So they were going 60 miles per hour."
Math,"And assuming they went on a constant speed the whole time, they should have been going 60 miles per hour on day two as well. And we can verify that. 60 miles per hour times 5 hours is indeed 300 miles, or 300 divided by 5 is 60. So they went 60 miles per hour. So which of these equations represent a relation between time elapsed in hours and distance that represents faster than 60 miles per hour. Well, here, you're taking the time times 60 to get distance, which is what we did over here."
Math,"Time times 60 to get distance, which is exactly their speed. But we care about a speed that is greater. And so pretty much all of these other coefficients are faster. So here you're taking your time times 65 miles per hour to get-- So you're going to go more distance, more than 60 miles per hour, in this situation. Here, you're going 70 miles per hour. Here you're going 80 miles per hour. And we got it right. Let's do one more."
Math,"Some vinyl records, let's call them oldies, rotate at the rate of 78 revolutions per minute. The chart below shows revolutions per minute for three different tracks on another type of vinyl record called goodies. Which has a greater rate of revolution, oldies or goodies? So oldies are at 78 revolutions per minute. Let's think about these revolutions per minute right over here. So in three minutes, this one makes 135 revolutions."
Math,"So how many per minute? So if we divide revolutions by minutes, you're going to get, let's see, 3 goes into 135-- it looks like it would go into, let's see, 3 goes into 120 40 times. So it looks like it goes 45 times. So it's 45 revolutions per minute for track one. Track two is also 45. 4 times 45, if I have 45 revolutions per minute times 4 minutes, that's 160 plus 20. Yep, that's 180. So these are all 45 revolutions per minute you can multiply 5 minutes times 45 revolutions per minute."
Math,"You're going to get 225. So the oldies go at 78 RPM. So they do 78 revolutions in a minute, while the goodies go 45. So the oldies do more revolutions in a minute. So oldies have a greater rate of revolutions per minute, or they just have a greater rate of revolutions per minute.."
Math,"And they also ask us to figure out what the equation of this line actually is. So let me get my scratch pad out and we could think about it. So let's just think about some potential x and y values here. So let's think about some potential x and y values. So when we're thinking about proportional relationships, that means that y is going to be equal to some constant times x."
Math,"So if we have a proportional relationship, if you have zero x's, it doesn't matter what your constant here is, you're going to have zero y's. So the point 0, 0 should be on your line. So if this is the point 0, 0, this should be on my line right over there. Now, let's think about what happens as we increase x. So if x goes from 0 to 1, we already know that a change of 1 unit in x corresponds to a change of 0.4 units in y. So if x increases by 1, then y is going to increase by 0.4."
Math,"It's not so easy to graph this 1 comma 0.4. The 0.4 is hard to graph on this little tool right over here. So let's try to get this to be a whole number. So then when x increases another 1, y is going to increase by 0.4 again. It's going to get to 0.8. When x increases again by 1, then y is going to increase by 0.4 again. It's going to get to 1.2. If x increases again, y is going to increase by 0.4 again. So just to 1.6. Notice, every time x is increasing by 1, y is increasing by 0.4."
Math,"That's exactly what they told us here. Now, if x increases by 1 again to 5, then y is going to increase 0.4 to 2. And I like this point because this is nice and easy to graph. So we see that the point 0, 0 and the point 5 comma 2 should be on this graph. And I could draw it. And I'm going to do it on the tool in a second as well. So it'll look something like this. And notice the slope of this actual graph over here. Notice the slope of this actual graph. If our change in x is 5."
Math,"So notice, here our change in x is 5. Our change in x is 5. You see that as well. When you go from 0 to 5, this change in x is 5. Change in x is equal to 5. What was our corresponding change in y? Well, our corresponding change in y when our change in x was 5, our change in y was equal to 2. And you see that here, when x went from 0 to 5, y went from 0 to 2. So our change in y in this circumstance is equal to 2."
Math,"So our slope, which is change in y over change in x, is the rate of change of your vertical axis with respect to your horizontal axis, is going to be equal to 2 over 5, or 2/5. Which if you wrote it as a decimal is equal to 0.4. So this right over here is your slope. So I'm going to do this with the tool. But first, let's also think about what the equation of this line is going to be. Well, we know that y is equal to some constant times x. And we know that the point 5, 2 is on this line right over here."
Math,"So we could say, well, when x is equal to 5, y is equal to 2. Or, when y equals 2, we have k times 5, or k is equal to-- dividing both sides by 5, you can't see that. If I divide both sides by 5, I'm left with k is equal to 2/5. Which makes sense. We're used to seeing this. When we have y is equal to something times x, this something right over here is going to be our slope. So the equation of the line is y is equal to 0.4x. So let's fill this in. Let's actually do the exercise now."
Math,"So we had two points, one was the point 0, 0. When x is 0, y is 0. And when x is 5, y is 0.4 times that. So it's y is equal to 2. And we said the equation is y is equal to 0.4 times x. So let's check our answer.."
Math,"Then they give us a bunch of other points. When x is 3, y is 0.5. When x is 6, y is 1, so on and so forth. So let's graph one of these that actually have integer values for both coordinates. So when x is 6, y is 1. So we only need two points to specify the line. So we've actually graphed it. But then they also ask us, what is the slope of this line? And we just have to remind ourselves. Our slope is what is our change in y for a given change in x."
Math,"So, for example, or another way to think about it, what is your change in y over your change in x? So here, our x changed by 6. It went from 0 to 6. And our y changed by 1. So our change in y over our change in x, which is the definition of slope, our change in y is 1, when our change in x is 6. See that right over here. Change in y, 1 when our change in x is 6. Let's check our answer. We got it right.."
Math,"When x equals 0, 2.5 times 0 is going to be 0. So when x is 0, y is going to be equal to 0. And then let's just pick another x that will give us a y that is a whole number. So if x increases by 1, y is going to increase by 2.5. It's going to go right over there, and I could graph it just like that. And we see just by what I just said that the unit rate of change of y with respect to x is 2.5. A unit increase in x, an increase of 1 and x, results in a 2.5 increase in y. You see that right over here."
Math,"x goes from 0 to 1, and y goes from 0 to 2.5. But let's increase x by another 1, and then y is going to increase by 2.5 again to get to 5. Or you could say, hey, look, if x is equal to 2, 2.5 times 2 is equal to 5. So this is a legitimate graph for this equation, but then they also tell us to select the statements that are true. So the first one is the equation does not represent a proportional relationship. Well, this is a proportional relationship."
Math,"A proportional relationship is one where, first of all, if you have zero x's, you're going to have zero y's, where y is equal to some constant times And here, y is equal to 2.5 times x. So this is definitely a proportional relationship, so I'm not going to check that. The unit rate of the relationship is 2/5. So I'm assuming-- this is a little ambiguous the way they stated it. I'm assuming they're saying the unit rate of change of y with respect to x."
Math,"And the unit rate of change of y with respect to x is, when x increases 1, y changed 2.5. So here they're saying when x changes by 1, y changes by 0.4, 2/5 is the same thing as 0.4. This should be 5/2. 5/2 would be 2.4. So this isn't right as well. The slope of the line is 2.5. Well, this looks right. Slope is change in y over change in x. When x changes 1, y changes 2.5. So change in y, 2.5, over change in x, 1. 2.5 over 1 is 2.5. And you could also see it looking at the form of this equation."
Math,"y is equal to-- this is the slope times x. So that's right. A change of 5 units in x results in a change of 2 units in y. Well, let's test that idea. We know when x is 0, y is 0. So if x goes from 0 to 5, what's going to happen to y? Well, y is going to be 2.5 times 5. 2.5 times 5 is 12.5. So y would not just change 2. It actually would change 12.5. So this isn't right. A change of 2 units in x results in a change of 5 units in y. Well, we see that."
Math,A change in 2 units of x results in a change of 5 units in y. That's exactly what we graphed right over here. These two points show that. So this is definitely true..
Math,"And he was somewhat of a contemporary of Galileo. He was 32 years younger, although he died shortly after Galileo died. This guy died at a much younger age. Galileo was well into his 70s. Descartes died at what is only 54 years old. And he's probably most known in popular culture for this quote right over here, a very philosophical quote."
Math,"""I think, therefore I am."" But I also wanted to throw in, and this isn't that related to algebra, but I just thought it was a really neat quote, probably his least famous quote, this one right over here. And I like it just because it's very practical, and it makes you realize that these great minds, these pillars of philosophy and mathematics, at the end of the day, they really were just human beings. And he said, ""You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made."
Math,"But I just kept pushing."" Which I think is very, very good life advice. Now, he did many things in philosophy and mathematics. But the reason why I'm including him here as we build our foundations of algebra is that he is the individual most responsible for a very strong connection between algebra and geometry. So on the left over here, you have the world of algebra, and we've discussed it a little bit. You have equations that deal with symbols, and these symbols are essentially they can take on values."
Math,"So you could have something like y is equal to 2x minus 1. This gives us a relationship between whatever x is and whatever y is. And we can even set up a table here and pick values for x and see what the values of y would be. And I could just pick random values for x, and then figure out what y is. But I'll pick relatively straightforward values just so that the math doesn't get too complicated."
Math,"So for example, if x is negative 2, then y is going to be 2 times negative 2 minus 1, which is negative 4 minus 1, which is negative 5. If x is negative 1, then y is going to be 2 times negative 1 minus 1, which is equal to-- this is negative 2 minus 1, which is negative 3. If x is equal to 0, then y is going to be 2 times 0 minus 1. 2 times 0 is 0 minus 1 is just negative 1. I'll do a couple more. And I could have picked any values here."
Math,"I could have said, well, what happens if x is the negative square root of 2, or what happens if x is negative 5/2, or positive 6/7? But I'm just picking these numbers because it makes the math a lot easier when I try to figure out what y is going to be. But when x is 1, y is going to be 2 times 1 minus 1. 2 times 1 is 2 minus 1 is 1. And I'll do one more. I'll do one more in a color that I have not used yet. Let's see, this purple. If x is 2, then y is going to be 2 times 2-- now our x is 2-- minus 1."
Math,"So that is 4 minus 1 is equal to 3. So fair enough. I just kind of sampled this relationship. I said, OK, this describes the general relationship between a variable y and a variable x. And then I just made it a little bit more concrete. I said, OK, well, then for each of these values of x, what would be the corresponding value of y? And what Descartes realized is is that you could visualize this."
Math,"One, you could visualize these individual points, but that could also help you, in general, to visualize this relationship. And so what he essentially did is he bridged the worlds of this kind of very abstract, symbolic algebra and that and geometry, which was concerned with shapes and sizes and angles. So over here you have the world of geometry. And obviously, there are people in history, maybe many people, who history may have forgotten who might have dabbled in this."
Math,"But before Descartes, it's generally viewed that geometry was Euclidean geometry, and that's essentially the geometry that you studied in a geometry class in eighth or ninth grade or 10th grade in a traditional high school curriculum. And that's the geometry of studying the relationships between triangles and their angles, and the relationships between circles and you have radii, and then you have triangles inscribed in circles, and all the rest. And we go into some depth in that in the geometry playlist."
Math,"But Descartes said, well, I think I can represent this visually the same way that you could with studying these triangles and these circles. He said, well, if we view a piece of paper, if we think about a two-dimensional plane, you could view a piece of paper as kind of a section of a two-dimensional plane. And we call it two dimensions because there's two directions that you could go in. There's the up/down direction. That's one direction. So let me draw that."
Math,"I'll do it in blue because we're starting to visualize things, so I'll do it in the geometry color. So you have the up/down direction. And you have the left/right direction. That's why it's called a two-dimensional plane. If we're dealing in three dimensions, you would have an in/out dimension. And it's very easy to do two dimensions on the screen because the screen is two dimensional. And he, says, well, you know, there are two variables here, and they have this relationship."
Math,"So why don't I associate each of these variables with one of these dimensions over here? And by convention, let's make the y variable, which is really the dependent variable-- the way we did it, it depends on what x is-- let's put that on the vertical axis. And let's put our independent variable, the one where I just randomly picked values for it to see what y would become, let's put that on the horizontal axis."
Math,"And it actually was Descartes who came up with the convention of using x's and y's, and we'll see later z's, in algebra so extensively as unknown variables or the variables that you're manipulating. But he says, well, if we think about it this way, if we number these dimensions-- so let's say that in the x direction, let's make this right over here is negative 3. Let's make this negative 2. This is negative 1. This is 0. Now, I'm just numbering the x direction, the left/right direction."
Math,"Now this is positive 1. This is positive 2. This is positive 3. And we could do the same in the y direction. So let's see, so this could be, let's say this is negative 5, negative 4, negative 3, negative-- actually, let me do it a little bit neater than that. Let me clean this up a little bit. So let me erase this and extend this down a little bit so I can go all the way down to negative 5 without making it look too messy. So let's go all the way down here. And so we can number it. This is 1. This is 2."
Math,"This is 3. And then this could be negative 1, negative 2. And these are all just conventions. It could have been labeled the other way. We could've decided to put the x there and the y there and make this the positive direction and make this the negative direction. But this is just the convention that people adopted starting with Descartes. Negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, and negative 5. And he says, well, I think I can associate each of these pairs of values with a point in two dimensions."
Math,"I can take the x-coordinate, I can take the x value right over here, and I say, OK, that's a negative 2. That would be right over there along the left/right direction. I'm going to the left because it's negative. And that's associated with negative 5 in the vertical direction. So I say the y value is negative 5, and so if I go 2 to the left and 5 down, I get to this point right over there."
Math,"So he says, these two values, negative 2 and negative 5, I can associate it with this point in this plane right over here, in this two-dimensional plane. So I'll say that point has the coordinates, tells me where to find that point, negative 2, negative 5. And these coordinates are called Cartesian coordinates, named for Rene Descartes because he's the guy that came up with these. He's associating, all of a sudden, these relationships with points on a coordinate plane."
Math,"And then he said, well, OK, let's do another one. There's this other relationship, where I have when x is equal to negative 1, y is equal to negative 3. So x is negative 1, y is negative 3. That's that point right over there. And the convention is, once again, when you list the coordinates, you list the x-coordinate, then the y-coordinate. And that's just what people decided to do. Negative 1, negative 3, that would be that point right over there. And then you have the point when x is 0, y is negative 1."
Math,"When x is 0 right over here, which means I don't go to the left or the right, y is negative 1, which means I go 1 down. So that's that point right over there, 0, negative 1, right over there. And I could keep doing this. When x is 1, y is 1. When x is 2, y is 3. Actually, let me do it in that same purple color. When x is 2, y is 3, 2 comma 3. And then this one right over here in orange was 1 comma 1. And this is neat by itself. I essentially just sampled possible x's."
Math,"But what he realized is, not only do you sample these possible x's, but if you just kept sampling x's, if you tried sampling all the x's in between, you would actually end up plotting out a line. So if you were to do every possible x, you would end up getting a line that looks something like that right over there. And any relation, if you pick any x and find any y, it really represents a point on this line."
Math,"Or another way to think about it, any point on this line represents a solution to this equation right over here. So if you have this point right over here, which looks like it's about x is 1 and 1/2, y is 2. So me write that, 1.5 comma 2. That is a solution to this equation. When x is 1.5, 2 times 1.5 is 3 minus 1 is 2. That is right over there. So all of a sudden, he was able to bridge this gap or this relationship between algebra and geometry."
Math,"We can now visualize all of the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation right over here. And so he is responsible for making this bridge, and that's why the coordinates that we use to specify these points are called Cartesian coordinates. And as we'll see, the first type of equations we will study are equations of this form over here. And in a traditional algebra curriculum, they're called linear equations. And you might be saying, well, OK, this is an equation. I see that this is equal to that."
Math,"But what's so linear about them? What makes them look like a line? And to realize why they are linear, you have to make this jump that Rene Descartes made, because if you were to plot this using Cartesian coordinates on a Euclidean plane, you will get a line. And in the future, we'll see that there's other types of equations where you won't get a line, where you'll get a curve or something kind of crazy or funky.."
Math,"So we have negative three and everywhere we see an x, everywhere we see an x, we can replace it with negative four. So it's negative three times negative four, minus, minus and everywhere we see a y, we can replace it with positive four. We replace it with positive four. So negative three times x minus y, which is four, needs to be equal to six. Needs to be equal to six. Now is this indeed the case? Negative three times negative four is positive 12."
Math,"Positive 12 minus four, positive 12 minus four is equal to eight, it's not equal to six. Is not equal, is not equal to six. So this one does not work out. So let's see, negative three comma three. We can do the same thing here. Let's see what happens when x is equal to negative three and y is equal to positive three. So we substitute back in, we get negative three. Negative three times x, which now we're going to try out x being equal to negative three. Minus y, minus y. Y is positive three here."
Math,"Minus y, gonna do that y color blue. Minus y now needs to be equal to, now needs to be equal, just like before needs to be equal to six. So negative three times negative three. That's going to be positive nine. Nine minus three is indeed equal to six. Nine minus three is indeed equal to six. Nine minus three is six. That is equal to six. This works out. So negative three comma three is an ordered pair that is a solution to this equation.."
Math,"So let's try that out. So, we have four times x. Well we're saying x needs to be equal to three, minus one, is going to be equal to three times y. Well, if this ordered pair is a solution then y is going to be equal to two, so three times y, y is two, plus five. Notice all I did is wherever I saw the x, I substituted it with three, wherever I saw the y, I substituted it with two. Now let's see if this is true. Four times three is twelve, minus one."
Math,"Is this really the same thing as three times two which is six, plus five? See, 12 minus one is 11, six plus five is also 11. This is true, 11 equals 11. This pair three, two does satisfy this equation. Now let's see whether this one does, two, three. So this is saying when x is equal to two, y would be equal to three for this equation. Let's see if that's true. So four times x, we're now gonna see if when x is two, y can be three."
Math,"So four times x, four times two, minus one is equal to three times y, now y we're testing to see if it can be three. Three times three plus five, let's see if this is true. Four times two is eight, minus one, is this equal to three times three? So that's nine plus five. So is seven equal to 14? No, clearly seven is not equal to 14. So these things are not equal to each other. So this is not a solution, when x equals two y cannot be to three and satisfy this equation. So only three, two is a solution.."
Math,"And to figure this out, I've actually copied and pasted this part of the problem onto my scratchpad, so let me get that out. And so this is the exact same problem, there's a couple of ways that we could try to tackle it. One way, is you could try to simplify this more, get all your xs on one side and all your ys on the other side. Or we could just literally substitute when x equals negative five, what must y equal? Actually, let me do it the second way, first."
Math,"So if we take this equation, and we substitute x with negative five, what do we get? We get negative three times, well, we're gonna say x is negative five, times negative five, plus seven y is equal to five times, x is once again, it's gonna be negative five, x is negative five, five times negative five, plus two y. See, negative three times negative five is positive 15, plus seven y, is equal to negative 25 plus two y."
Math,"And now, to solve for y, let's see, I could subtract two y from both sides, so that I get rid of the two y here on the right. So let me subtract two y, subtract two y from both sides. And then if I want all my constants on the right hand side, I can subtract 15 from both sides. So let me subtract 15 from both sides. And I'm going to be left with 15 minus 15, that's zero, that's the whole point of subtracting 15 from both sides, so I get rid of this 15 here. Seven y minus two y."
Math,"Seven of something minus two of that same something is gonna be five of that something. It's gonna be equal to five y, is equal to negative 25 minus 15. Well, that's gonna be negative 40. And then two y minus two y, well, that's just gonna be zero. That was the whole point of subtracting two y from both sides. So you have five times y is equal to negative 40. Or, if we divide both sides by five, we divide both sides by five, we would get y is equal to negative eight."
Math,"So when x is equal to negative five, y is equal to negative eight. Y is equal to negative eight. And actually we can fill that in. So this y is going to be equal to negative eight. And now we gotta figure this out. What does x equal when y is positive eight? Well, we can go back to our scratchpad here. And I'll take the same equation, but let's make y equal to positive eight."
Math,"So you have negative three x plus seven, now y is going to be eight, y is eight, seven times eight is equal to five times x, plus two times, once again, y is eight, two times eight. So we get negative three x plus 56, that's 56, is equal to five x plus 16. Now, if we wanna get all of our constants on one side, and of all of our x terms on the other side, well, what could we do? Let's see, we could add three x to both sides. That would get rid of all the xs on this side, and put 'em all on this side."
Math,"So we're gonna add three x to both sides. And, let's see, if we want to get all the constants on the left hand side, we'd wanna get rid of the 16, so we could subtract 16 from the right hand side, if we do it from the right, we're gonna have to do it from the left as well. And we're gonna be left with, these cancel out, 56 minus 16 is positive 40. And then, let's see, 16 minus 16 is zero. Five x plus three x is equal to eight x. We get eight x is equal to 40."
Math,"We could divide both sides by eight, and we get, five is equal to x. So this right over here is going to be equal to five. So let's go back, let's go back, now. So when y is positive eight, x is positive five. Now they ask us, ""Use your two solutions ""to graph the equation."" So let's see if we can do, oh, whoops, let me, let me use my mouse now. So to graph the equations. So when x is negative five, y is negative eight. So the point negative five comma negative eight. So that's right over there."
Math,"So let me move my browser up so you can see that. Negative five, when x is negative five, y is negative eight. And when x is positive five, and we see that up here, when x is positive five, y is positive eight. When x is positive five, y is positive eight. And we're done. We can check our answer, if we like. We got it right. Now, I said there was two ways to tackle it, I kind of just did it, I guess you could say, the naive way. I just substituted negative five directly into this and solved for y."
Math,"And then I substituted y equals positive eight directly into this, and then solved for x. Another way that I could have done it, that actually probably would have been, or, it would for sure, would have been the easier way to do it, is ahead of time to try to simplify this expression. So what I could have done, right from the get-go, is said, ""Hey, let's put all my xs on one side, ""and all my ys on the other side."" So this is negative three x plus seven y is equal to five x plus two y."
Math,"Now let's say I wanna get all my ys on the left and all my xs on the right. So I don't want this negative three x on the left, so I'd wanna add three x. Adding three x would cancel this out, but I can't just do it on the left hand side, I have to do it on the right hand side as well. And then, if I wanna get rid of this two y on the right, I could subtract two y from the right, but, of course, I'd also wanna do it from the left."
Math,"And then what am I left with? So negative three x plus three x is zero, seven y minus two y is five y. And then I have five x plus three x is eight x. Two y minus two y is zero. And then if I wanted to, I could solve for y, I could divide both sides by five and I'd get y is equal to 8/5 x. So, this right over here represents the same exact equation as this over here, it's just written in a different way. All of the xy pairs that satisfy this, would satisfy this, and vice versa. And this is much easier."
Math,"Because if x is now negative five, if x is negative five, y would be 8/5 times negative five, well, that's going to be negative eight. And when y is equal to eight, well, you actually could even do this up here, you could say five times eight is equal to eight x, and then you could see, well five times eight the same thing as eight times five, so x would be equal to five. So I think this would actually have been a simpler way to do it."
Math,"You see it all, I was able to do the entire problem in this little white space here, instead of having to do all of this, slightly, slightly hairier, algebra.."
Math,"And we can just try a couple of x values here, then figure out what the corresponding y values are. I'm going to pick x values where it's going to be fairly easy to calculate the y values. Let's say when x is equal to zero, then you're gonna have 1/2 x 0 - 3, well then y is going to be -3. When x is, let me try x = 2, because then 1/2 x 2 is just gonna be 1. So when x = 2, you're going to have 1/2 x 2 = 1, -3 is -2. When x is equal to, let's try 4."
Math,"So 1/2 x 4 is 2, and then -3 is -1, and we could keep going but actually all we need is two points for a line. So we're ready to plot this line if we'd like. The point 0, -3 is on this line. 0, -3 and actually let me do this in a slightly darker color so that we can see it on this white background. 0, -3 is on the line, 2, -2 is on the line. So 2, -2 and then we have 4, -1. So when x is 4, y is -1, and I could draw a line that connects all of these so it would look something like..."
Math,"If I, let's see if I could do this. It would look something like, it would something like, like that. So this right over here, this is literally, this is the graph of y = 1/2x - 3. Now when we look at a graph like this an interesting thing that we might want to ask ourself is where does the graph intersect our axes? So first we can say, well where does in intersect our x-axis? When you look at this, it looks like it happens at this point right over here."
Math,"This point where a graph intersects an axes this is called an intercept. This one in particular is called the x-intercept. Why is it called the x-intercept? Because that's where the graph is intersecting the x-axis and the x-intercept, it looks like this is at the .6, 0. Now it's very interesting, the x-intercept happens when y = 0. Remember, you're on the x-axis when you haven't moved up or down from that axis which means y = 0. So your x-intercept happens at x = 6, y = 0. It's this coordinate."
Math,"Now what about the y-intercept? Well the y-intercept is this point right over here. This is where you intersect or I guess you could say intercept the y-axis. So this right over here, that over there is the y-intercept. The y-intercept is at the coordinate that has a 0 for the x-coordinate. X is 0 here and y is -3. X is 0 and y is -3. This was actually one of the points, or one of the pairs that we first tried out. You can validate that 6, 0 satisfies this equation right over here."
Math,"If x is 6, 1/2 x 6 is 3, -3 is indeed equal to 0. So now that we know what an x-intercept is, it's the point where a graph intersects the x-axis or intercepts the x-axis and the y-intercept is the point where a graph intercepts the y-axis or intersects the y-axis. Let's try to see if we can find the x and y-intercepts for a few other linear equations. So let's say that I had the linear equation. Let's say that I have 5x + 6y = 30."
Math,"I encourage you to pause this video, and figure out what are the x and y-intercepts for the graph that represents the solutions, all the xy pairs that satisfy this equation. Well the easiest thing to do here, let's see what the y value is when x = 0 and what x value is when y = 0. When x = 0 this becomes 6y = 30. So 6 times what is 30? Well y would be equal to 5 here. So when x is 0, y is 5. What about when y is 0? Well when y is 0, that's going to be 0, and you have 5x = 30."
Math,"Well then x would be equal to 6. Then x would be equal to 6. So we could plot those points, 0, 5. When x is 0, y is 5. When x is 6, y is 0. So those are both points on this graph and then the actual graph is going to, or the actual line that represents the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation is going to look like, it's going to look like this. I'll just try. So I can make it go, it's going to look like... It's going to go through those two points. So it going to...I can make it go the other way too."
Math,"Let me see. It's going to go through those two points and so it's going to look something like that. Now what are its' x and y-intercepts? Well, we already kind of figured it out but the intercepts themselves, these are the points on the graph where they intersect the axes. So this right over here, this is the y-intercept. That point is the y-intercept and it happens, it's always going to happen when x = 0, and when x = 0 we know that y = 5. It's that point, the point 0, 5."
Math,"And what is the y inter...what is the x-intercept? The x-intercept is the point, it's actually the same x-intercept for this equation right over here. It's the point 6, 0. That point right over there.."
Math,"Notice right over here our y value is exactly 0. We're sitting on the x-axis. So let's think about what this x value must be. Well, just trying to eyeball a little bit, it's a little over 2. It's between 2 and 3. It looks like it's less than 2 and 1/2. But we don't know the exact value. So let's go turn to the equation to figure out the exact value. We essentially have to figure out what x value, when y is equal to 0, will have this equation be true. So we could just say 2 times 0 plus 3x is equal to 7."
Math,"Well, 2 times 0 is just going to be 0, so we have 3x is equal to 7. Then we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x, and we get x is equal to 7/3. Does that look like 7/3? Well, we just have to remind ourselves that 7/3 is the same thing as 6/3 plus 1/3. And 6/3 is 2. So this is the same thing as 2 and 1/3. Another way you could think about it is 3 goes into 7 two times, and then you have a remainder of 1. So you've still got to divide that 1 by 3."
Math,"It's 2 full times and then a 1/3, so this looks like 2 and 1/3. And so that's its x-intercept, 7/3. If I was doing this on the exercise on Khan Academy, it's always a little easier to type in the improper fraction, so I would put in 7/3.."
Math,"So whenever someone talks about intercepts, they're talking about where you're intersecting the x and the y-axes. So let me label my axes here, so this is the x-axis and that is the y-axis there. And when I intersect the x-axis, what's going on? What is my y value when I'm at the x-axis? Well, my y value is 0, I'm not above or below the x-axis. Let me write this down."
Math,"The x-intercept is when y is equal to 0, right? And then by that same argument, what's the y-intercept? Well, if I'm somewhere along the y-axis, what's my x value? Well, I'm not to the right or the left, so my x value has to be 0, so the y-intercept occurs when x is equal to 0. So to figure out the intercepts, let's set y equal to 0 in this equation and solve for x, and then let's set x is equal to 0 and then solve for y. So when y is equal to 0, what does this equation become? I'll do it in orange."
Math,"You get negative 5x plus 4y. Well we're saying y is 0, so 4 times 0 is equal to 20. 4 times 0 is just 0, so we can just not write that. So let me just rewrite it. So we have negative 5x is equal to 20. We can divide both sides of this equation by negative 5. The negative 5 cancel out, that was the whole point behind dividing by negative 5, and we get x is equal to 20 divided by negative 5 is negative 4. So when y is equal to 0, we saw that right there, x is equal to negative 4."
Math,"Or if we wanted to plot that point, we always put the x coordinate first, so that would be the point negative 4 comma 0. So let me graph that. So if we go 1, 2, 3, 4. That's a negative 4. And then the y value is just 0, so that point is right over there. That is the x-intercept, y is 0, x is negative 4. Notice we're intersecting the x-axis. Now let's do the exact same thing for the y-intercept. Let's set x equal to 0, so if we set x is equal to 0, we have negative 5 times 0 plus 4y is equal to 20."
Math,"Well, anything times 0 is 0, so we can just put that out of the way. And remember, this was setting x is equal to 0, we're doing the y-intercept now. So this just simplifies to 4y is equal to 20. We can divide both sides of this equation by 4 to get rid of this 4 right there, and you get y is equal to 20 over 4, which is 5. So when x is equal to 0, y is equal to 5. So the point 0, 5 is on the graph for this line. So 0, 5. x is 0 and y is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right over there."
Math,"And notice, when x is 0, we're right on the y-axis, this is our y-intercept right over there. And if we graph the line, all you need is two points to graph any line, so we just have to connect the dots and that is our line. So let me connect the dots, trying my best to draw as straight of a line is I can-- well, I can do a better job than that-- to draw as straight of a line as I can. And that's the graph of this equation using the x-intercept and the y-intercept.."
Math,"And by the exact same argument, the y-intercept occurs when we're not to the right or the left of the y-axis, so that's when x is equal to 0. So let's set each of these values to 0 and then solve for what the other one has to be at that point. So for the x-intercept, when y is equal to 0, let's solve this. So we get 2 times 0, plus 1/3x is equal to 12. I just set y is equal to 0 right there, right? I put 0 for y. Well, anything times 0 is just 0, so you're just left with 1/3x is equal to 12."
Math,"To solve for x, you can think of it as either dividing both sides by 1/3, or we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 1/3. And the reciprocal of 1/3 is 3, or you can even think of it as 3 over 1. So times 3 over 1. And so we're left with 3 times 1/3, that just cancels out, so you're left with x is equal to 12 times 3, or x is equal to 36. So when y is equal to 0, x is 36. So the point 36 comma 0 is on the graph of this equation. And this is also the x-intercept."
Math,"Now, let's do the same thing for the y-intercept. So let's set x equal 0, so you get 2y plus 1/3, times 0 is equal to 12. Once again, anything times 0 is 0. So that's 0, and you're just left with 2y is equal to 12. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for y, and you're left with y is equal to 12 over 2, is 6. So the y-intercept is when x is equal to 0 and y is equal to 6. So let's plot these two points. I'll just do a little hand-drawn graph, and make it clear what the x- and the y-intercepts are."
Math,"So let me draw-- that's my vertical axis, and that is my horizontal axis-- and we have the point 36 comma 0. So this is the origin right here, that's the x-axis, that's the y-axis. The point 36 comma 0 might be all the way over here. So that's the point 36 comma 0. And if that's 36, then the point 0, 6 might be right about there. So that's the point 0, 6. And the line will look something like this. I'm trying my best to draw a straight line."
Math,"And notice where the line intercepted or intersected the y-axis, that's the y-intercept, x is 0, because we're not to the right or the left of it. Where the line intersected the x-axis, y is 0, because we're not above or below it.."
Math,"So ideally, we'd be able to assign a number to each of these lines or to any lines that describes how steep it is, how quickly does it increase or decrease? So what's a reasonable way to do that? What's a reasonable way to assign a number to these lines that describe their steepness? Well one way to think about it, could say well, how much does a line increase in the vertical direction for a given increase in the horizontal direction? So let's write this down."
Math,"So let's say if we an increase increase, in vertical, in vertical, for a given increase in horizontal for a given increase a given increase in horizontal. So, how can this give us a value? Well let's look at that magenta line again. Now let's just start at an arbituary point in that magenta line. But I'll start at a point where it's going to be easy for me to figure out what point we're at. So if we were to start right here, and if I were to increase in the horizontal direction by one."
Math,"So I move one to the right. To get back on the line, how much do I have to increase in the vertical direction? Well I have to increase in the vertical direction by two. By two. So at least for this magenta line, it looks like our increase in vertical is two, whenever we have an increase in one in the horizontal direction. Let's see, does that still work if I were to start here, instead of increasing the horizontal direction by one, if I were increase in the horizontal direction..."
Math,"So let's increase by three. So now, I've gone plus three in the horizontal direction, then to get back on the line, how much do I have to increase in the vertical direction? I have to increase by one, two, three, four, five, six I have to increase by six. So plus six. So when I increase by three in the horizontal direction, I increase by six in the vertical."
Math,"We were just saying, hey, let's just measure how much to we increase in vertical for a given increase in the horizontal? Well two over one is just two and that's the same thing as six over three. So no matter where I start on this line, no matter where I start on this line, if I take and if I increase in the horizontal direction by a given amount, I'm going to increase twice as much twice as much in the vertical direction. Twice as much in the vertical direction."
Math,"So this notion of this increase in vertical divided by increase in horizontal, this is what mathematicians use to describe the steepness of lines. And this is called the slope. So this is called the slope of a line. And you're probably familiar with the notion of the word slope being used for a ski slope, and that's because a ski slope has a certain inclination. It could have a steep slope or a shallow slope. So slope is a measure for how steep something is."
Math,"And the convention is, is we measure the increase in vertical for a given in increase in horizontal. So six two over one is equal to six over three is equal to two, this is equal to the slope of this magenta line. So let me write this down. So this slope right over here, the slope of that line, is going to be equal to two. And one way to interpret that, for whatever amount you increase in the horizontal direction, you're going to increase twice as much in the vertical direction."
Math,"Now what about this blue line here? What would be the slope of the blue line? Well, let me rewrite another way that you'll typically see the definition of slope. And this is just the convention that mathematicians have defined for slope but it's a valuable one. What is are is our change in vertical for a given change in horizontal? And I'll introduce a new notation for you. So, change in vertical, and in this coordinate, the vertical is our Y coordinate. divided by our change in horizontal."
Math,"And X is our horizontal coordinate in this coordinate plane right over here. So wait, you said change in but then you drew this triangle. Well this is the Greek letter delta. This is the Greek letter delta. And it's a math symbol used to represent change in. So that's delta, delta. And it literally means, change in Y, change in Y, divided by change in X, change in X."
Math,"So if we want to find the slope of the blue line, we just have to say, well how much does Y change for a given change in X? So, the slope of the blue line. So let's see, let me do it this way. Let's just start at some point here. And let's say my X changes by two so my delta X is equal to positive two. What's my delta Y going to be? What's going to be my change in Y? Well, if I go by the right by two, to get back on the line, I'll have to increase my Y by two."
Math,"So my change in Y is also going to be plus two. So the slope of this blue line, the slope of the blue line, which is change in Y over change in X. We just saw that when our change in X is positive two, our change in Y is also positive two. So our slope is two divided by two, which is equal to one. Which tells us however much we increase in X, we're going to increase the same amount in Y. We see that, we increase one in X, we increase one in Y. Increase one in X, increase one in Y."
Math,">From any point on the line, that's going to be true. You increase three in X, you're going to increase three in Y. It's actually true the other way. If you decrease one in X, you're going to decrease one in Y. If you decrease two in X, you're going to decrease two in Y."
Math,"And that makes sense from the math of it as well Because if you're change in X is negative two, that's what we did right over here, our change is X is negative two, we went two back, then your change in Y is going to be negative two as well. Your change in Y is going to be negative two, and negative two divided by negative two, is positive one, which is your slope again.."
Math,"So for example, this orange line isn't inclined at all. It's flat, so this one actually has a slope of 0. Another way of thinking about it is as x increases, what is happening to y? And you see here that y isn't changing at all, so this orange line right now has a slope of 0. If the orange line looked like this, it now has a positive slope. Notice, when x is negative, your y value-- or say when x is negative 5, your y value is here, and then when x is positive 5, your y value has increased."
Math,"As x increases, y is increasing, so this has a positive slope. This has an even more positive slope, an even more positive slope. This has an even more positive slope. As x is increasing, the y value is increasing really fast. This line is going up really fast as we move towards the right, so it's a very positive slope. This is less positive, less positive. This is a 0 slope, and then this is a negative slope. Notice, as x is increasing, the line is going down. Your y value is decreasing."
Math,"When x is negative 5, your y is 7. Well, when x is 5, your y is 5. So x is increased, but y has gone down, so this is a negative slope. So they say graph a line that has a slope that is negative and greater than the slope of the blue line. So the blue line also has a negative slope. As x is increasing, your blue line is going down. Over here, when x has negative values, your y value is quite high. And here, when x has positive values, your y value has gone all the way down."
Math,"So this has a negative slope, but we want to have a slope greater than this one. So we still want to have a-- they say graph a line that has a slope that is negative-- so my orange line currently has a negative slope-- and greater than the slope of the blue line. So it has a negative slope, but it is less negative than this blue line right over here. If I wanted to be more negative than the blue line, I'd have to do something like that."
Math,"But I want to be negative but less negative than the blue line, so that would be like that. If we wanted a 0 slope, once again, something like this. If we wanted a positive slope, something like this. So once again, negative slope, less negative than the blue line. Check our answer.."
Math,"So for example, if we're looking at the xy plane here, our change in the vertical direction is gonna be a change in the y variable divided by change in horizontal direction, is gonna be a change in the x variable. So let's see why that is a good definition for slope. Well I could draw something with a slope of one. A slope of one might look something like... so a slope of one, as x increases by one, y increases by one, so a slope of one... is going to look like this."
Math,"Notice, however much my change in x is, so for example here, my change in x is positive two, I'm gonna have the same change in y. My change in y is going to be plus two. So my change in y divided by change in x is two divided by two is one. So for this line I have slope is equal to one. But what would a slope of two look like? Well, a slope of two should be steeper and we can draw that. Let me start at a different point, so if I start over here a slope of two would look like..."
Math,"for every one that I increase in the x direction I'm gonna increase two in the y direction, so it's going to look like... This line right over here, you see it. If my change in x is equal to one, my change in y is two. So change in y over change in x is gonna be two over one, the slope here is two. And now, hopefully, you're appreciating why this definition of slope is a good one."
Math,"The higher the slope, the steeper it is, the faster it increases, the faster we increase in the vertical direction as we increase in the horizontal direction. Now what would a negative slope be? So let's just think about what a line with a negative slope would mean. A negative slope would mean, well we could take an example. If we have our change in y over change in x was equal to a negative one."
Math,"That means that if we have a change in x of one, then in order to get negative one here, that means that our change in y would have to be equal to negative one. So a line with a negative one slope would look like... would look like this. Notice, as x increases by a certain amount, so our delta x here is one, y decreases by that same amount instead of increasing. So now this is what we consider a downward sloping line. So change in y is equal to negative one."
Math,"So our change in y over our change in x is equal to negative one over one which is equal to negative one. So the slope of this line is negative one. Now if you had a slope with negative two, it would decrease even faster. So a line with a slope of negative two could look something like this. So as x increases by one, y would decrease by two. So it would look something like... it would look like that. Notice, as our x increases by a certain amount, our y decreases by twice as much."
Math,"So this right over here has a slope of negative two. So hopefully this gives you a little bit more intuition for what slope represents and how the number that we use to represent slope, how you can use that to visualize how steep a line is. A very high positive slope, as x increases, y is going to increase fairly dramatically. If you have a negative slope... as x increases, your y is actually going to decrease."
Math,"And then the higher the slope, the steeper, the more you increase as x increases, and the more negative the slope, the more you decrease as x increases.."
Math,"And for a line, this will always be constant. And sometimes you might see it written like this: you might see this triangle, that's a capital delta, that means change in, change in y over change in x. That's just a fancy way of saying change in y over change in x. So let's see what this change in y is for any change in x. So let's start at some point that seems pretty reasonable to read from this table right here, from this graph."
Math,"So let's see, we're starting here-- let me do it in a more vibrant color-- so let's say we start at that point right there. And we want to go to another point that's pretty straightforward to read, so we can move to that point right there. We could literally pick any two points on this line. I'm just picking ones that are nice integer coordinates, so it's easy to read. So what is the change in y and what is the change in x? So first let's look at the change in x."
Math,"So if we go from there to there, what is the change in x? My change in x is equal to what? Well, I can just count it out. I went 1 steps, 2 steps, 3 steps. My change in x is 3. And you could even see it from the x values. If I go from negative 3 to 0, I went up by 3. So my change in x is 3. So let me write this, change in x, delta x is equal to 3. And what's my change in y? Well, my change in y, I'm going from negative 3 up to negative 1, or you could just say 1, 2."
Math,"So my change in y, is equal to positive 2. So let me write that down. Change in y is equal to 2. So what is my change in y for a change in x? Well, when my change in x was 3, my change in y is 2. So this is my slope. And one thing I want to do, I want to show you that I could have really picked any two points here. Let's say I didn't pick-- let me clear this out-- let's say I didn't pick those two points, let me pick some other points, and I'll even go in a different direction."
Math,"I want to show you that you're going to get the same answer. Let's say I've used this as my starting point, and I want to go all the way over there. Well, let's think about the change in y first. So the change in y, I'm going down by how many units? 1, 2, 3, 4 units, so my change in y, in this example, is negative 4. I went from 1 to negative 3, that's negative 4. That's my change in y. Change in y is equal to negative 4."
Math,"Now what is my change in x? Well I'm going from this point, or from this x value, all the way-- let me do that in a different color-- all the way back like this. So I'm going to the left, so it's going to be a negative change in x, and I went 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 units back. So my change in x is equal to negative 6. And you can even see I started it at x is equal to 3, and I went all the way to x is equal to negative 3. That's a change of negative 6. I went 6 to the left, or a change of negative 6."
Math,"So what is my change in y over change in x? My change in y over change in x is equal to negative 4 over negative 6. The negatives cancel out and what's 4 over 6? Well, that's just 2 over 3. So it's the same value, you just have to be consistent. If this is my start point, I went down 4, and then I went back 6. Negative 4 over negative 6. If I viewed this as my starting point, I could say that I went up 4, so it would be a change in y would be 4, and then my change in x would be 6."
Math,"And either way, once again, change in y over change in x is going to be 4 over 6, 2/3. So no matter which point you choose, as long as you kind of think about it in a consistent way, you're going to get the same value for slope.."
Math,"And let me show you what that means. So let's start at some arbitrary point on this line, and they highlight some of these points. So let's start at one of these points right over here. So if we wanted to start one of these points-- and let's say we want to change our x in the positive direction. So we want to go to the right. So let's say we want to go from this point to this point over here. How much do we have to move in x? So if we want to move in x, we have to go from this point to this point."
Math,"We're going from negative 3 to 0. So our change in x-- and this triangle, that's delta. That means ""change in."" Our change in x is equal to 3. So what was our change in y when our change in x is equal to 3? Well, when we moved from this point to this point, our x-value changed by 3, but what happened to our y-value? Well, our y-value went down. It went from positive 3 to positive 2. Our y-value went down by 1. So our change in y is equal to negative 1. So we rose negative 1. We actually went down."
Math,"So our rise is negative 1 when our run-- when our change in x-- is 3. So change in y over change in x is negative 1 over 3, or we could say that our slope is negative 1/3. Let me scroll over a little bit. It is negative 1/3. And I want to show you that we can do this with any two points on the line. We could even go further than 3 in the x-direction. So let's go the other way."
Math,"Let's start at this point right over here and then move backwards to this point over here, just to show you that we'll still get the same result. So to go from this point to that point, what is our change in x? So our change in x is this right over here. Our change in x is that distance right over there. We started at 3, and we went to negative 3. We went back 6. Over here, our change in x is equal to negative 6. We're starting at this point now. So over here our change in x is negative 6."
Math,"And then when our change in x is negative 6, when we start at this point and we move 6 back, what is our change of y to get to that point? Well, our y-value went from 1. That was our y-value at this point. And then when we go back to this point, our y-value is 3. So what did we do? We moved up by 2. Our change in y is equal to 2. Slope is change in y over change in x, or rise over run. Change in y is just rise. Change in x is just run, how much you're moving in the horizontal direction."
Math,"So rise over run in this example right over here is going to be 2 over negative 6, which is the same thing as negative 1/3. And you could verify it for yourself. Take any of these two points, start at one of these two points, and figure out what is the run to get to the next point, and then what is the rise to get the next point. And for any line, the slope won't change. Let me do it again. Over here, we had to move in the positive 3 direction, so that is our run. So this right here is positive 3."
Math,"That's our run. But what's our rise? Well, we actually went down, so we have a negative rise. Our rise is negative 1. So we have negative 1 as our rise. We went down. And our run was positive 3. So our slope here is negative 1/3.."
Math,"The triangles here, that's the delta symbol. It literally means ""change in."" Or another way, and you might see this formula, and it tends to be really complicated. But just remember it's just these two things over here. Sometimes, slope will be specified with the variable m. And they'll say that m is the same thing-- and this is really the same thing as change in y. They'll write y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1."
Math,"And this notation tends to be kind of complicated, but all this means is, is you take the y-value of your endpoint and subtract from it the y-value of your starting point. That will essentially give you your change in y. And it says take the x-value of your endpoint and subtract from that the x-value of your starting point. And that'll give you change in x. So whatever of these work for you, let's actually figure out the slope of the line that goes through these two points."
Math,"So we're starting at-- and actually, we could do it both ways. We could start at this point and go to that point and calculate the slope or we could start at this point and go to that point and calculate the slope. So let's do it both ways. So let's say that our starting point is the point 4 comma 2. And let's say that our endpoint is negative 3 comma 16. So what is the change in x over here? What is the change in x in this scenario? So we're going from 4 to negative 3."
Math,"If something goes from 4 to negative 3, what was it's change? You have to go down 4 to get to 0, and then you have to go down another 3 to get to negative 3. So our change in x here is negative 7. Actually, let me write it this way. Our change in x is equal to negative 3 minus 4, which is equal to negative 7. If I'm going from 4 to negative 3, I went down by 7. Our change in x is negative 7. Let's do the same thing for the change in y. And notice, I implicitly use this formula over here."
Math,"Our change in x was this value, our endpoint, our end x-value minus our starting x-value. Let's do the same thing for our change in y. Our change in y. If we're starting at 2 and we go to 16, that means we moved up 14. Or another way you could say it, you could take your ending y-value and subtract from that your starting y-value and you get 14. So what is the slope over here? Well, the slope is just change in y over change in x."
Math,"So the slope over here is change in y over change in x, which is-- our change in y is 14. And our change in x is negative 7. And then if we want to simplify this, 14 divided by negative 7 is negative 2. Now, what I want to show you is, is that we could have done it the other way around. We could have made this the starting point and this the endpoint. And what we would have gotten is the negative values of each of these, but then they would've canceled out and we would still get negative 2."
Math,"Let's try it out. So let's say that our start point was negative 3 comma 16. And let's say that our endpoint is the 4 comma 2. 4 comma 2. So in this situation, what is our change in x? Our change in x. If I start at negative 3 and I go to 4, that means I went up 7. Or if you want to just calculate that, you would do 4 minus negative 3. 4 minus negative 3. But needless to say, we just went up 7. And what is our change in y? Our change in y over here, or we could say our rise."
Math,"If we start at 16 and we end at 2, that means we went down 14. Or you could just say 2 minus 16 is negative 14. We went down by 14. This was our run. So if you say rise over run, which is the same thing as change in y over change in x, our rise is negative 14 and our run here is 7. So notice, these are just the negatives of these values from when we swapped them. So once again, this is equal to negative 2. And let's just visualize this."
Math,"Let me do a quick graph here just to show you what a downward slope would look like. So let me draw our two points. So this is my x-axis. That is my y-axis. So this point over here, 4 comma 2. So let me graph it. So we're going to go all the way up to 16. So let me save some space here. So we have 1, 2, 3, 4. It's 4 comma-- 1, 2. So 4 comma 2 is right over here. 4 comma 2. Then we have the point negative 3 comma 16. So let me draw that over here. So we have negative 1, 2, 3. And we have to go up 16."
Math,"So this is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. So it goes right over here. So this is negative 3 comma 16. Negative 3 comma 16. So the line that goes between them is going to look something like this. Try my best to draw a relatively straight line. That line will keep going. So the line will keep going. So that's my best attempt. And now notice, it's downward sloping. As you increase an x-value, the line goes down. It's going from the top left to the bottom right."
Math,"As x gets bigger, y gets smaller. That's what a downward-sloping line looks like. And just to visualize our change in x's and our change in y's that we dealt with here, when we started at 4 and we ended at-- or when we started at 4 comma 2 and ended at negative 3 comma 16, that was analogous to starting here and ending over there. And we said our change in x was negative 7. We had to move back. Our run we had to move in the left direction by 7. That's why it was a negative 7."
Math,"And then we had to move in the y-direction. We had to move in the y-direction positive 14. So that's why our rise was positive. So it's 14 over negative 7, or negative 2. When we did it the other way, we started at this point. We started at this point, and then ended at this point. Started at negative 3, 16 and ended at that point. So in that situation, our run was positive 7. And now we have to go down in the y-direction since we switched the starting and the endpoint."
Math,"And now we had to go down negative 14. Our run is now positive 7 and our rise is now negative 14. Either way, we got the same slope.."
Math,"For example, if I can manipulate that equation to be in the form Y is equal to MX plus B, well then I know that this M here, the coefficient on the X term, well that's going to be my slope. And B is going to be my Y intercept, we cover that in many other videos. Another option is to get into point-slope form."
Math,"So the general framework or the general template for point-slope form is, if I have an equation of the form Y minus Y1 is equal to M times X minus X1, well then I immediately know that the line that this equation describes is going to have a slope of M once again. And here the Y intercept doesn't jump out at you. Let me make sure you can read this over here. The Y intercept doesn't jump out at you, but you know a point that is on this line."
Math,"In particular, you know that the point X1, Y1 is going to be on this line. X1, Y1. So let's look at our original example. So it might immediately jump out at you that this is actually in point-slope form. You might say, well okay, I see I have a minus X1, so X1 would be three, I have my slope here and that answers our question, our slope would be negative two. But here it says plus two, I have to subtract a Y1."
Math,"Well, you could just rewrite this, so it says, so you have Y minus negative two is equal to negative two times X minus three, and then you see it's exactly this point-slope form right over here. So our slope right over there is negative two, and then if I were to ask you, well give me a point that sits on this line, you could say, alright, an X1 would be three, and a Y1 would be negative two."
Math,"This point sits on the line, it's not the Y intercept, but it's a point on the line and we know the slope is negative two. Now another way to approach this is to just manipulate it so that we get into slope-intercept form. So let's do that, let's manipulate it so we get into slope-intercept form. So the first thing my brain wants to do is distribute this negative two, and if I do that, I get Y plus two is equal to negative 2x, negative two times negative three, plus six."
Math,"And then I can subtract two from both sides, and then I get Y is equal to negative 2x plus four. And so here I am in slope Y intercept form, and once again, I could say, alright my M here, the coefficient on the X term, is my slope. So my slope is negative two. Let's do another example. So here, this equation doesn't immediately go into either one of these forms, so let's manipulate it."
Math,"And if it's in either one of them, I like to get into slope Y intercept form, it's a little bit easier for my brain to understand. So let's do that. So let us collect, well let's get the Xs, let's just isolate the Y on the right-hand side, since the 2y is already there. So let's add three to both sides. I'm just trying to get rid of this negative three. So if we add three to both sides, on the left-hand side we have negative 4x plus 10 is equal to 2y, these cancel out. That was the whole point."
Math,"And now to solve for Y, we just have to divide both sides by two. So if we divide everything by two, we get negative 2x plus five is equal to Y. So this is in slope-intercept form. I just have the Y on the right-hand side instead of the left-hand side. We have Y is equal to mx plus B, and so our M is the coefficient on the X term right over here. So our slope is once again, is negative two, and here our Y intercept is five, in case we wanted to know it. Let's do one more example, one more example."
Math,"Alright, so once again, this is in neither slope-intercept or point-slope form to begin with, so let's just try to get it to slope-intercept form. And like always, pause the video, and see if you can figure it out yourself. Alright, so let's get all the Ys on the left-hand side isolated, and the Xs on the right-hand side. So let me get rid of this negative 3x. So I'm gonna add 3x to both sides, and let's get rid of this 3y right over here. So let's subtract 3y from both sides."
Math,"You couldn't do this, I'm doing two steps at once, but once again, I'm trying to get rid of this 3x, so I'm trying to get rid of this negative 3x, so I add 3x to the left, but I have to do it to the right if I want to maintain the equality. And if I want to get rid of this 3y, well I subtract 3y from here, but I have to do it on the left-hand side if I want to maintain the equality."
Math,"So what do I get? That cancels out, 5y minus 3y is 2y, is equal to 2x plus 3x is 5x, and then these two characters cancel out. And so if I want to solve for Y, I just divide both sides by two and I get Y is equal to five halves X, and I'm done. And you mights say wait, if this doesn't look exactly like slope-intercept form, where is my B? Well your B, if you wanted to see it, you could just write plus zero, B is implicitly zero right over here."
Math,"So your slope, your slope is going to be the coefficient on the X term, it's going to be five halves. And if you want to know your Y intercept, well it's zero, when X is zero, Y is zero.."
Math,"That's why it's called slope-intercept form. So we just have to algebraically manipulate these equations into this form. So let's start with line A, so start with a line A. So line A, it's in standard form right now, it's 4x plus 2y is equal to negative 8. The first thing I'd like to do is get rid of this 4x from the left-hand side, and the best way to do that is to subtract 4x from both sides of this equation. So let me subtract 4x from both sides."
Math,"The left hand side of the equation, these two 4x's cancel out, and I'm just left with 2y is equal to. And on the right-hand side I have negative 4x minus is 8, or negative 8 minus 4, however you want to do it. Now we're almost at slope-intercept form. We just have to get rid of this 2, and the best way to do that that I can think of is divide both sides of this equation by 2. So let's divide both sides by 2. So we divide the left-hand side by 2 and then divide the right-hand side by 2."
Math,"You have to divide every term by 2. And then we are left with y is equal to negative 4 divided by 2 is negative 2x. Negative 8 divided by 2 is negative 4, negative 2x minus 4. So this is line A, let me graph it right now. So line A, its y-intercept is negative 4. So the point 0, negative 4 on this graph. If x is equal to 0, y is going to be equal to negative 4, you can just substitute that in the graph. So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's the point 0, negative 4. That's the y-intercept for line A."
Math,"And then the slope is negative 2x. So that means that if I change x by positive 1 that y goes down by negative 2. So let's do that. So if I go over one in the positive direction, I have to go down 2, that's what a negative slope's going to do, negative 2 slope. If I go over 2, I'm going to have to go down 4. If I go back negative 1, so if I go in the x direction negative 1, that means in the y direction I go positive two, because two divided by negative one is still negative two, so I go over here."
Math,"If I go back 2, I'm going to go up 4. Let me just do that. Back 2 and then up 4. So this line is going to look like this. Do my best to draw it, that's a decent job. That is line A right there. All right, let's do line B. So line B, they say 4x is equal to negative 8, and you might be saying hey, how do I get that into slope-intercept form, I don't see a y. And the answer is you won't be able to because you this can't be put into slope-intercept form, but we can simplify it."
Math,"So let's divide both sides of this equation by 4. So you divide both sides of this equation by 4. And you get x is equal to negative 2. So this just means, I don't care what your y is, x is just always going to be equal to negative 2. So x is equal to negative 2 is right there, negative 1, negative 2, and x is just always going to be equal to negative 2 in both directions. And this is the x-axis, that's the y-axis, I forgot to label them. Now let's do this last character, 2y is equal to negative eight."
Math,"So line C, we have 2y is equal to negative 8. We can divide both sides of this equation by 2, and we get y is equal to negative 4. So you might say hey, Sal, that doesn't look like this form, slope-intercept form, but it is. It's just that the slope is 0. We can rewrite this as y is equal to 0x minus 4, where the y-intercept is negative 4 and the slope is 0. So if you move an arbitrary amount in the x direction, the y is not going to change, it's just going to stay at negative 4."
Math,Let me do a little bit neater. y is just going to stay at negative 4. Or you can just interpret it as y is equal to negative 4 no matter what x is. So then we are done..
Math,"So our first point is 7, negative 1. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This is the x-axis. 7, negative 1. So it's 7, negative 1 is right over there. 7, negative 1. This, of course, is the y-axis. And then the next point is negative 3, negative 1. So we go back 3 in the horizontal direction. Negative 3 for the y-coordinate is still negative 1. So the line that connects these two points will look like this. It will look like that."
Math,"Now, they're asking us to find the slope of the line that goes through the ordered pairs. Find the slope of this line. And just to give a little bit of intuition here, slope is a measure of a line's inclination. And the way that it's defined-- slope is defined as rise over run, or change in y over change in x, or sometimes you'll see it defined as the variable m."
Math,"And then they'll define change in y as just being the second y-coordinate minus the first y-coordinate and then the change in x as the second x-coordinate minus the first x-coordinate. These are all different variations in slope, but hopefully you'll appreciate that these are measuring inclination. If I rise a ton when I run a little bit, if I move a little bit in the x direction, and I rise a bunch, then I have a very steep line. I have a very steep upward-sloping line."
Math,"If I don't change at all when I run a bit, then I have a very low slope. And that's actually what's happening here. I'm going from-- you could either view this as the starting point or view this as the starting point. But let's view this as the starting point. So this negative 3, 1. If I go from negative 3, negative 1 to 7, negative 1, I'm running a good bit. I'm going from negative 3. My x value is negative 3 here, and it goes all the way to 7. So my change in x here is 10."
Math,"To go from negative 3 to 7, I changed my x value by 10. But what's my change in y? Well, my y value here is negative 1, and my y value over here is still negative 1. So my change in y is a 0. My change in y is going to be 0. My y value does not change no matter how much I change my x value. So the slope here is going to be-- when we run 10, what was our rise? How much did we change in y? Well, we didn't rise at all. We didn't go up or down. So the slope here is 0."
Math,"Or another way to think about is this line has no inclination. It's a completely flat-- it's a completely horizontal line. So this should make sense. This is a 0. The slope here is 0. And just to make sure that this gels with all of these other formulas that you might know-- but I want to make it very clear. These are all just telling you rise over run or change in y over change in x, a way to measure inclination. But let's just apply them just so, hopefully, it all makes sense to you."
Math,"So we could also say slope is change in y over change in x. If we take this to be our start and if we take this to be our end point, then we would call this over here x1. And then this is over here. This is y1. And then we would call this x2 and we would call this y2, if this is our start point and that is our end point. And so the slope here, the change in y, y2 minus y1. So it's negative 1 minus negative 1, all of that over x2, negative 3, minus x1, minus 7."
Math,"So the numerator, negative 1 minus negative 1, that's the same thing as negative 1 plus 1. And our denominator is negative 3 minus 7, which is negative 10. So once again, negative 1 plus 1 is 0 over negative 10. And this is still going to be 0. And the only reason why we got a negative 10 here and a positive 10 there is because we swapped the starting and the ending point. In this example right over here, we took this as the start point and made this coordinate over here as the end point."
Math,"Over here, we swapped them around. 7, negative 1 was our start point, and negative 3, negative 1 is our end point. So if we start over here, our change in x is going to be negative 10. But our change in y is still going to be 0. So regardless of how you do it, the slope of this line is 0. It's a horizontal line.."
Math,"I could manipulate it in ways where I get it to, and I'm gonna do it right now, but this is another way of writing that same thing. y minus five is equal to two times x minus one. You could actually simplify this and you could get either this equation here or that equation up on top. These are all equivalent, you can get from one to the other with logical algebraic operations."
Math,"So there's an infinite number of ways to represent a given linear equation, but I what I wanna focus on in this video is this representation in particular, because this one is a very useful representation of a linear equation and we'll see in future videos, this one and this one can also be useful, depending on what you are looking for, but we're gonna focus on this one, and this one right over here is often called slope-intercept form. Slope-intercept form."
Math,"And hopefully in a few minutes, it will be obvious why it called slop-intercept form. And before I explain that to you, let's just try to graph this thing. I'm gonna try to graph it, I'm just gonna plot some points here, so x comma y, and I'm gonna pick some x values where it's easy to calculate the y values. So maybe the easiest is if x is equal to zero. If x is equal to zero, then two times zero is zero, that term goes away, and you're only left with this term right over here, y is equal to three."
Math,"Y is equal to three. And so if we were to plot this. Actually let me start plotting it, so that is my y axis, and let me do the x axis, so that can be my x, oh that's not as straight as I would like it. So that looks pretty good, alright."
Math,"That is my x axis and let me mark off some hash marks here, so this is x equals one, x equals two, x equals three, this is y equals one, y equals two, y equals three, and obviously I could keep going and keep going, this would be y is equal to negative one, this would be x is equal to negative one, negative two, negative three, so on and so forth. So this point right over here, zero comma three, this is x is zero, y is three."
Math,"Well, the point that represents when x is equal to zero and y equals three, this is, we're right on the y axis. If they have a line going through it and this line contains this point, this is going to be the y- intercept. So one way to think about it, the reason why this is called slope-intercept form is it's very easy to calculate the y-intercept."
Math,"The y-intercept here is going to happen when it's written in this form, it's going to happen when x is equal to zero and y is equal to three, it's gonna be this point right over here. So it's very easy to figure out the intercept, the y-intercept from this form. Now you might be saying, well it says slope-intercept form, it must also be easy to figure out the slope from this form. And if you made that conclusion, you would be correct! And we're about to see that in a few seconds."
Math,"So let's plot some more points here and I'm just gonna keep increasing x by one. So if you increase x by one, so we could write that our delta x, our change in x, delta Greek letter, this triangle is a Greek letter, delta, represents change in. Change in x here is one. We just increased x by one, what's gonna be our corresponding change in y? What's going to be our change in y? So let's see, when x is equal to one, we have two times one, plus three is going to be five."
Math,"So our change in y is going to be two. Let's do that again. Let's increase our x by one. Change in x is equal to one. So then if we're gonna increase by one, we're gonna go from x equals one to x equals two. Well what's our corresponding change in y? Well when x is equal to two, two times two is four, plus three is seven. Well our change in y, our change in y is equal to two. Went from five- when x went from one to two, y went from five to seven. So for every one that we increase x, y is increasing by two."
Math,"So for this linear equation, our change in y over change in x is always going to be, our change in y is two when our change in x is one, or it's equal to two, or we could say that our slope is equal to two. Well let's just graph this to make sure that we understand this. So when x equals one, y is equal to five. And actually we're gonna have to graph five up here. So when x is equal to one, y is equal to, and actually this is a little bit higher, this, let me clean this up a little bit."
Math,"So this one would be, erase that a little bit. Just like that. So that's y is equal to four, and this is y is equal to five. So when x is one, y is equal to five, so it's that point right over there. So our line is going to look- you only need two points to define a line, our line is going to like, let me do this in this color right over here."
Math,"Our line is going to look like, is going to look, is going to look something like, is going to look, let me see if I can, I didn't draw it completely at scale, but it's going to look something like this. This is the line, this is the line, y is equal to 2x plus three. But we already figured out that its slope is equal to two, when our change in x is one, when our change in x is one, our change in y is two."
Math,"If our change in x was negative one, if our change in x was negative one, our change in y is negative two. And you can see that, if from zero we went, we went down one, if we went to negative one, then what's our y going to be? Two times negative one is negative two plus three is one. So we see that, the point negative one comma one is on the line as well. So the slope here, our change in y over change in x, if we're going from between any two points on this line, is always going to be two."
Math,But where do you see two in this original equation? Well you see the two right over here.
Math,"And when you write something in slop-intercept form, where you explicitly solve for y, y is equal to some constant times x to the first power plus some other constant, the second one is going to be your intercept, your y-intercept, or it's going to be a way to figure out the y-intercept, the intercept itself is this point, the point at which the line intercepts the y axis, and then this two is going to represent your slope."
Math,"And that makes sense because every time you increase x by one, you're gonna multiply that by two, so you're gonna increase y by two. So this is just a, kinda of a get your feet wet with the idea of slope-intercept form, but you'll see, at least for me, this is the easiest form for me to think about what the graph of something looks like, because if you were given another, if you were given another linear equation, let's say y is equal to negative x, negative x plus two."
Math,"Well immediately you say, okay look, my yintercept is going to be the point zero comma two, so I'm gonna intersect the y axis right at that point, and then I have a slope of, the coefficient here is really just negative one, so I have a slope of negative one. So as we increase x by one, we're gonna decrease y by one. Increase x by one, you're gonna decrease y by one. If you increase x by two, you're gonna decrease y by two. And so our line is gonna look something like this."
Math,"Let me see if I can draw it relatively neatly. It's going to look something, I think I can do a little bit better than that. It's 'cus my graph paper is hand drawn. It's not ideal, but I think you get, you get the point. It's gonna look something like that. So from slope-intercept form, very easy to figure out what the y-intercept is, and very easy to figure out the slope. The slope here, slope here is negative one."
Math,"That's this negative one right over here, and the y-intercept, y-intercept is the point zero comma two, very easy to figure out 'cus essentially that gave you the information right there.."
Math,"So if they're saying, what is the slope here? Well I just need to figure out, what is the coefficient on this x term? And you can see that the coefficient here is a negative four. So that is going to be our m, that is going to be our slope. Now just as a reminder, you have to make sure that it's solved in this way, that is is solved for y, y is equal to something times x minus three, so that's our slope. Let's do another one of these."
Math,"So we're asked, what is the y intercept of y is equal to negative three x minus two? So once again we already have it in slope intercept form. It's already been solved for y. It's of the form y is equal to mx plus b, where m, our slope, is given right over here, negative three. But they're not asking for our slope, they're asking for the y intercept. Well the y intercept is given by b here, so b is negative two. Pay close attention to the sign here. So b is equal to negative two."
Math,"But when I look at these choices, I don't see a b is equal to negative two, so what are they talking about? Well a y intercept is, what is the y value when x is equal to zero? And you could see that here, if x was equal to zero then that term goes away and y is equal to b. So if you want to know the point where the graph described by this equation intercepts the y axis, well it's going to be what is y when x is equal to zero? Well when x is equal to zero, y is equal to negative two."
Math,"And you could see that in our original equation, again. If x were zero, this term would go away, and y would be equal to negative two. So zero, comma, negative two. So it would be that choice right over there. On Khan Academy obviously you just have to click on that, you don't have to shade it in. Let's do one more. Complete the equation of the line whose slope is five, and y intercept is zero, comma, four."
Math,"So once again the general form is y is equal to our slope times x, if I want to put it in slope intercept form, plus our y intercept. Well they're telling us, our slope is five. Whose slope is five. So we know that m is going to be five. And they tell us that the y intercept is zero, four. So the y intercept, b, that is the value of y when x is equal to zero. So the value of y when x equals zero is this four right over here. So that is going to be four. So I could say y is equal to five times x plus four."
Math,"And when you're actually entering it on Khan Academy, you would just type it in, or if you're using the app you would use it with your finger. And I always make the mistake of writing y equals, and I type in y equals five x plus four. Notice they already gave you the y equals right over there. That's all you have to do, recognize the slope, the y intercept, and then remember what the slope intercept form actually is.."
Math,"And here in this case, m is equal to 1/3-- so let me write that down-- m is equal to 1/3, and b is the y-intercept. So in this case, b is equal to negative 2. And you know that b is the y-intercept, because we know that the y-intercept occurs when x is equal to 0. So if x is equal to 0 in either of these situations, this term just becomes 0 and y will be equal to b. So that's what we mean by b is the y-intercept."
Math,"So whenever you look at an equation in this form, it's actually fairly straightforward to graph this line. b is the y-intercept. In this case it is negative 2, so that means that this line must intersect the y-axis at y is equal to negative 2, so it's this point right here. Negative 1, negative 2, this is the point 0, negative 2. If you don't believe me, there's nothing magical about this, try evaluating or try solving for y when x is equal to 0."
Math,"When x is equal to 0, this term cancels out and you're just left with y is equal to negative 2. So that's the y-intercept right there. Now, this 1/3 tells us the slope of the line. How much do we change in y for any change in x? So this tells us that 1/3, so that right there, is the slope. So it tells us that 1/3 is equal to the change in y over the change in x. Or another way to think about it, if x changes by 3, then y would change by 1. So let me graph that."
Math,"So we know that this point is on the graph, that's the y-intercept. The slope tells us that if x changes by 3-- so let me go 3 three to the right, 1, 2, 3-- that y will change by 1. So this must also be a point on the graph. And we could keep doing that. If x changes by 3, y changes by 1. If x goes down by 3, y will go down by 1. If x goes down by 6, y will go down by 2. It's that same ratio, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2."
Math,"And you can see all of these points are on the line, and the line is the graph of this equation up here. So let me graph it. So it'll look something like that. And you're done.."
Math,"The rise over run of the line. Or the inclination of the line. And b is the y-intercept. I think it's pretty easy to verify that b is a y-intercept. The way you verify that is you substitute x is equal to 0. If you get x is equal to 0-- remember x is equal to 0, that means that's where we're going to intercept at the y-axis. If x is equal to 0, this equation becomes y is equal to m times 0 plus b. m times 0 is just going to be 0. I don't care what m is. So then y is going to be equal to b."
Math,"So the point 0, b is going to be on that line. The line will intercept the y-axis at the point y is equal to b. We'll see that with actual numbers in the next few videos. Just to verify for you that m is really the slope, let's just try some numbers out. We know the point 0, b is on the line. What happens when x is equal to 1? You get y is equal to m times 1. Or it's equal to m plus b. So we also know that the point 1, m plus b is also on the line. Right? This is just the y value."
Math,"So what's the slope between that point and that point? Let's take this as the end point, so you have m plus b, our change in y, m plus b minus b over our change in x, over 1 minus 0. This is our change in y over change in x. We're using two points. That's our end point. That's our starting point. So if you simplify this, b minus b is 0. 1 minus 0 is 1. So you get m/1, or you get it's equal to m."
Math,"So hopefully you're satisfied and hopefully I didn't confuse you by stating it in the abstract with all of these variables here. But this is definitely going to be the slope and this is definitely going to be the y-intercept. Now given that, what I want to do in this exercise is look at these graphs and then use the already drawn graphs to figure out the equation. So we're going to look at these, figure out the slopes, figure out the y-intercepts and then know the equation. So let's do this line A first."
Math,"So what is A's slope? Let's start at some arbitrary point. Let's start right over there. We want to get even numbers. If we run one, two, three. So if delta x is equal to 3. Right? One, two, three. Our delta y-- and I'm just doing it because I want to hit an even number here-- our delta y is equal to-- we go down by 2-- it's equal to negative 2. So for A, change in y for change in x. When our change in x is 3, our change in y is negative 2. So our slope is negative 2/3."
Math,"When we go over by 3, we're going to go down by 2. Or if we go over by 1, we're going to go down by 2/3. You can't exactly see it there, but you definitely see it when you go over by 3. So that's our slope. We've essentially done half of that problem. Now we have to figure out the y-intercept. So that right there is our m. Now what is our b? Our y-intercept. Well where does this intersect the y-axis? Well we already said the slope is 2/3. So this is the point y is equal to 2."
Math,"When we go over by 1 to the right, we would have gone down by 2/3. So this right here must be the point 1 1/3. Or another way to say it, we could say it's 4/3. That's the point y is equal to 4/3. Right there. A little bit more than 1. About 1 1/3. So we could say b is equal to 4/3. So we'll know that the equation is y is equal to m, negative 2/3, x plus b, plus 4/3. That's equation A. Let's do equation B. Hopefully we won't have to deal with as many fractions here. Equation B."
Math,"Let's figure out its slope first. Let's start at some reasonable point. We could start at that point. Let me do it right here. Equation B. When our delta x is equal to-- let me write it this way, delta x. So our delta x could be 1. When we move over 1 to the right, what happens to our delta y? We go up by 3. delta x. delta y. Our change in y is 3. So delta y over delta x, When we go to the right, our change in x is 1. Our change in y is positive 3. So our slope is equal to 3."
Math,"What is our y-intercept? Well, when x is equal to 0, y is equal to 1. So b is equal to 1. So this was a lot easier. Here the equation is y is equal to 3x plus 1. Let's do that last line there. Line C Let's do the y-intercept first. You see immediately the y-intercept-- when x is equal to 0, y is negative 2. So b is equal to negative 2. And then what is the slope? m is equal to change in y over change in x. Let's start at that y-intercept. If we go over to the right by one, two, three, four."
Math,"So our change in x is equal to 4. What is our change in y? Our change in y is positive 2. So change in y is 2 when change in x is 4. So the slope is equal to 1/2, 2/4. So the equation here is y is equal to 1/2 x, that's our slope, minus 2. And we're done. Now let's go the other way. Let's look at some equations of lines knowing that this is the slope and this is the y-intercept-- that's the m, that's the b-- and actually graph them. Let's do this first line. I already started circling it in orange."
Math,"The y-intercept is 5. When x is equal to 0, y is equal to 5. You can verify that on the equation. So when x is equal to 0, y is equal to one, two, three, four, five. That's the y-intercept and the slope is 2. That means when I move 1 in the x-direction, I move up 2 in the y-direction. If I move 1 in the x-direction, I move up 2 in the y-direction. If I move 1 in the x-direction, I move up 2 in the y-direction. If I move back 1 in the x-direction, I move down 2 in the y-direction."
Math,"If I move back 1 in the x-direction, I move down 2 in the y-direction. I keep doing that. So this line is going to look-- I can't draw lines too neatly, but this is going to be my best shot. It's going to look something like that. It'll just keep going on, on and on and on. So that's our first line. I can just keep going down like that. Let's do this second line. y is equal to negative 0.2x plus 7. Let me write that. y is equal to negative 0.2x plus 7. It's always easier to think in fractions."
Math,"So 0.2 is the same thing as 1/5. We could write y is equal to negative 1/5 x plus 7. We know it's y-intercept at 7. So it's one, two, three, four, five, six. That's our y-intercept when x is equal to 0. This tells us that for every 5 we move to the right, we move down 1. We can view this as negative 1/5. The delta y over delta x is equal to negative 1/5. For every 5 we move to the right, we move down 1. So every 5. One, two, three, four, five. We moved 5 to the right. That means we must move down 1."
Math,"We move 5 to the right. One, two, three, four, five. We must move down 1. If you go backwards, if you move 5 backwards-- instead of this, if you view this as 1 over negative 5. These are obviously equivalent numbers. If you go back 5-- that's negative 5. One, two, three, four, five. Then you move up 1. If you go back 5-- one, two, three, four, five-- you move up 1. So the line is going to look like this. I have to just connect the dots. I think you get the idea. I just have to connect those dots."
Math,"I could've drawn it a little bit straighter. Now let's do this one, y is equal to negative x. Where's the b term? I don't see any b term. You remember we're saying y is equal to mx plus b. Where is the b? Well, the b is 0. You could view this as plus 0. Here is b is 0. When x is 0, y is 0. That's our y-intercept, right there at the origin. And then the slope-- once again you see a negative sign. You could view that as negative 1x plus 0. So slope is negative 1."
Math,"When you move to the right by 1, when change in x is 1, change in y is negative 1. When you move up by 1 in x, you go down by 1 in y. Or if you go down by 1 in x, you're going to go up by 1 in y. x and y are going to have opposite signs. They go in opposite directions. So the line is going to look like that. You could almost imagine it's splitting the second and fourth quadrants. Now I'll do one more. Let's do this last one right here. y is equal to 3.75."
Math,"Now you're saying, gee, we're looking for y is equal to mx plus b. Where is this x term? It's completely gone. Well the reality here is, this could be rewritten as y is equal to 0x plus 3.75. Now it makes sense. The slope is 0. No matter how much we change our x, y does not change. Delta y over delta x is equal to 0. I don't care how much you change your x. Our y-intercept is 3.75. So 1, 2, 3.75 is right around there. You want to get close. 3 3/4. As I change x, y will not change."
Math,"y is always going to be 3.75. It's just going to be a horizontal line at y is equal to 3.75. Anyway, hopefully you found this useful.."
Math,"Let me draw a quick line here just so that we can visualize that a little bit. So that is my y-axis. And then that is my x-axis. And let me draw a line. And since our line here has a negative slope, I'll draw a downward sloping line. So let's say our line looks something like that. So hopefully, we're a little familiar with the slope already."
Math,"The slope essentially tells us, look, start at some point on the line, and go to some other point of the line, measure how much you had to move in the x direction, that is your run, and then measure how much you had to move in the y direction, that is your rise. And our slope is equal to rise over run. And you can see over here, we'd be downward sloping. Because if you move in the positive x direction, we have to go down. If our run is positive, our rise here is negative."
Math,"So this would be a negative over a positive, it would give you a negative number. That makes sense, because we're downward sloping. The more we go down in this situation, for every step we move to the right, the more downward sloping will be, the more of a negative slope we'll have. So that's slope right over here. The y-intercept just tells us where we intercept the y-axis. So the y-intercept, this point right over here, this is where the line intersects with the y-axis. This will be the point 0 comma b."
Math,"And this actually just falls straight out of this equation. When x is equal to 0-- so let's evaluate this equation, when x is equal to 0. y will be equal to m times 0 plus b. Well, anything times 0 is 0. So y is equal to 0 plus b, or y will be equal to b, when x is equal to 0. So this is the point 0 comma b. Now, they tell us what the slope of this line is. They tell us a line has a slope of negative 3/4."
Math,"So we know that our slope is negative 3/4, and they tell us that the line goes through the point 0 comma 8. They tell us we go through the-- Let me just, in a new color. I've already used orange, let me use this green color. They tell us what we go through the point 0 comma 8. Notice, x is 0. So we're on the y-axis. When x is 0, we're on the y-axis. So this is our y-intercept."
Math,"So b, we could say-- we could do a couple-- our y-intercept is the point 0 comma 8, or we could say that b-- Remember, it's also 0 comma b. We could say b is equal to 8. So we know m is equal to negative 3/4, b is equal to 8, so we can write the equation of this line in slope-intercept form. It's y is equal to negative 3/4 times x plus b, plus 8. And we are done.."
Math,"to do this problem but it always help to visualize That is my y axis. And the first point is (-1,6) So (-1, 6). So negative 1 coma, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 6. So it's this point, rigth over there, it's (-1, 6). And the other point is (5, -4). So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And we go down 4, So 1, 2, 3, 4 So it's right over there. So the line connects them will looks something like this. Line will draw a rough approximation. I can draw a straighter than that. I will draw a dotted line maybe Easier do dotted line."
Math,"So the line will looks something like that. So let's find its equation. So good place to start is we can find its slope. Remember, we want, we can find the equation y is equal to mx plus b. This is the slope-intercept form where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. We can first try to solve for m. We can find the slope of this line. So m, or the slope is the change in y over the change in x."
Math,"Or, we can view it as the y value of our end point minus the y value of our starting point over the x-value of our end point minus the x-value of our starting point. Let me make that clear. So this is equal to change in y over change in x wich is the same thing as rise over run wich is the same thing as the y-value of your ending point minus the y-value of your starting point."
Math,"This is the same exact thing as change in y and that over the x value of your ending point minus the x-value of your starting point This is the exact same thing as change in x. And you just have to pick one of these as the starting point and one as the ending point. So let's just make this over here our starting point and make that our ending point. So what is our change in y? So our change in y, to go we started at y is equal to six, we started at y is equal to 6."
Math,"And we go down all the way to y is equal to negative 4 So this is rigth here, that is our change in y You can look at the graph and say, oh, if I start at 6 and I go to negative 4 I went down 10. or if you just want to use this formula here it will give you the same thing We finished at negative 4, we finished at negative 4 and from that we want to subtract, we want to subtract 6. This right here is y2, our ending y and this is our beginning y This is y1. So y2, negative 4 minus y1, 6."
Math,"or negative 4 minus 6. That is equal to negative 10. And all it does is tell us the change in y you go from this point to that point We have to go down, our rise is negative we have to go down 10. That's where the negative 10 comes from. Now we just have to find our change in x. So we can look at this graph over here. We started at x is equal to negative 1 and we go all the way to x is equal to 5. So we started at x is equal to negative 1, and we go all the way to x is equal to 5."
Math,"So it takes us one to go to zero and then five more. So are change in x is 6. You can look at that visually there or you can use this formula same exact idea, our ending x-value, our ending x-value is 5 and our starting x-value is negative 1. 5 minus negative 1. 5 minus negative 1 is the same thing as 5 plus 1. So it is 6. So our slope here is negative 10 over 6. wich is the exact same thing as negative 5 thirds. as negative 5 over 3 I divided the numerator and the denominator by 2."
Math,"So we now know our equation will be y is equal to negative 5 thirds, that's our slope, x plus b. So we still need to solve for y-intercept to get our equation. And to do that, we can use the information that we know in fact we have several points of information We can use the fact that the line goes through the point (-1,6) you could use the other point as well. We know that when is equal to negative 1, So y is eqaul to 6."
Math,"So y is equal to six when x is equal to negative 1 So negative 5 thirds times x, when x is equal to negative 1 y is equal to 6. So we literally just substitute this x and y value back into this and know we can solve for b. So let's see, this negative 1 times negative 5 thirds. So we have 6 is equal to positive five thirds plus b. And now we can subtract 5 thirds from both sides of this equation. so we have subtracted the left hand side."
Math,"From the left handside and subtracted from the rigth handside And then we get, what's 6 minus 5 thirds. So that's going to be, let me do it over here We take a common denominator. So 6 is the same thing as Let's do it over here. So 6 minus 5 over 3 is the same thing as 6 is the same thing as 18 over 3 minus 5 over 3 6 is 18 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3. And then of course, these cancel out. So we get b is equal to 13 thirds. So we are done."
Math,We know We know the slope and we know the y-intercept. The equation of our line is y is equal to negative 5 thirds x plus our y-intercept which is 13 which is 13 over 3. And we can write these as mixed numbers. if it's easier to visualize. 13 over 3 is four and 1 thirds. So this y-intercept right over here. this y-intercept right over here. That's 0 coma 13 over 3 or 0 coma 4 and 1 thirds. And even with my very roughly drawn diagram it those looks like this.
Math,"And the slope negative 5 thirds that's the same thing as negative 1 and 2 thirds. You can see here the slope is downward because the slope is negative. It's a little bit steeper than a slope of 1. It's not quite a negative 2. It's negative 1 and 2 thirds. if you write this as a negative, as a mixed number. So, hopefully, you found that entertaining.."
Math,"tell us that a line has a slope of negative 5, so m is equal to negative 5. And it has a y-intercept of 6. So b is equal to 6. So this is pretty straightforward. The equation of this line is y is equal to negative 5x plus 6. That wasn't too bad. Let's do this next one over here. The line has a slope of negative 1 and contains the point 4/5 comma 0. So they're telling us the slope, slope of negative 1. So we know that m is equal to negative 1, but we're not 100% sure about where the y-intercept is just yet."
Math,"So we know that this equation is going to be of the form y is equal to the slope negative 1x plus b, where b is the y-intercept. Now, we can use this coordinate information, the fact that it contains this point, we can use that information to solve for b. The fact that the line contains this point means that the value x is equal to 4/5, y is equal to 0 must satisfy this equation. So let's substitute those in. y is equal to 0 when x is equal to 4/5. So 0 is equal to negative 1 times 4/5 plus b."
Math,"I'll scroll down a little bit. So let's see, we get a 0 is equal to negative 4/5 plus b. We can add 4/5 to both sides of this equation. So we get add a 4/5 there. We could add a 4/5 to that side as well. The whole reason I did that is so that cancels out with that. You get b is equal to 4/5. So we now have the equation of the line. y is equal to negative 1 times x, which we write as negative x, plus b, which is 4/5, just like that. Now we have this one. The line contains the point 2 comma 6 and 5 comma 0."
Math,"So they haven't given us the slope or the y-intercept explicitly. But we could figure out both of them from these coordinates. So the first thing we can do is figure out the slope. So we know that the slope m is equal to change in y over change in x, which is equal to-- What is the change in y? Let's start with this one right here. So we do 6 minus 0. Let me do it this way. So that's a 6-- I want to make it color-coded-- minus 0. So 6 minus 0, that's our change in y. Our change in x is 2 minus 2 minus 5."
Math,"The reason why I color-coded it is I wanted to show you when I used this y term first, I used the 6 up here, that I have to use this x term first as well. So I wanted to show you, this is the coordinate 2 comma 6. This is the coordinate 5 comma 0. I couldn't have swapped the 2 and the 5 then. Then I would have gotten the negative of the answer. But what do we get here? This is equal to 6 minus 0 is 6. 2 minus 5 is negative 3. So this becomes negative 6 over 3, which is the same thing as negative 2."
Math,"So that's our slope. So, so far we know that the line must be, y is equal to the slope-- I'll do that in orange-- negative 2 times x plus our y-intercept. Now we can do exactly what we did in the last problem. We can use one of these points to solve for b. We can use either one. Both of these are on the line, so both of these must satisfy this equation. I'll use the 5 comma 0 because it's always nice when you have a 0 there. The math is a little bit easier. So let's put the 5 comma 0 there."
Math,"So y is equal to 0 when x is equal to 5. So y is equal to 0 when you have negative 2 times 5, when x is equal to 5 plus b. So you get 0 is equal to -10 plus b. If you add 10 to both sides of this equation, let's add 10 to both sides, these two cancel out. You get b is equal to 10 plus 0 or 10. So you get b is equal to 10. Now we know the equation for the line. The equation is y-- let me do it in a new color-- y is equal to negative 2x plus b plus 10. We are done. Let's do another one of these."
Math,"All right, the line contains the points 3 comma 5 and negative 3 comma 0. Just like the last problem, we start by figuring out the slope, which we will call m. It's the same thing as the rise over the run, which is the same thing as the change in y over the change in x. If you were doing this for your homework, you wouldn't have to write all this. I just want to make sure that you understand that these are all the same things."
Math,"Then what is our change in y over our change in x? This is equal to, let's start with the side first. It's just to show you I could pick either of these points. So let's say it's 0 minus 5 just like that. So I'm using this coordinate first. I'm kind of viewing it as the endpoint. Remember when I first learned this, I would always be tempted to do the x in the numerator. No, you use the y's in the numerator. So that's the second of the coordinates. That is going to be over negative 3 minus 3."
Math,"This is the coordinate negative 3, 0. This is the coordinate 3, 5. We're subtracting that. So what are we going to get? This is going to be equal to-- I'll do it in a neutral color-- this is going to be equal to the numerator is negative 5 over negative 3 minus 3 is negative 6. So the negatives cancel out. You get 5/6. So we know that the equation is going to be of the form y is equal to 5/6 x plus b. Now we can substitute one of these coordinates in for b. So let's do."
Math,"I always like to use the one that has the 0 in it. So y is a zero when x is negative 3 plus b. So all I did is I substituted negative 3 for x, 0 for y. I know I can do that because this is on the line. This must satisfy the equation of the line. Let's solve for b. So we get zero is equal to, well if we divide negative 3 by 3, that becomes a 1. If you divide 6 by 3, that becomes a 2. So it becomes negative 5/2 plus b. We could add 5/2 to both sides of the equation, plus 5/2, plus 5/2."
Math,"I like to change my notation just so you get familiar with both. So the equation becomes 5/2 is equal to-- that's a 0-- is equal to b. b is 5/2. So the equation of our line is y is equal to 5/6 x plus b, which we just figured out is 5/2, plus 5/2. We are done. Let's do another one. We have a graph here. Let's figure out the equation of this graph. This is actually, on some level, a little bit easier. What's the slope? Slope is change in y over change it x. So let's see what happens."
Math,"When we move in x, when our change in x is 1, so that is our change in x. So change in x is 1. I'm just deciding to change my x by 1, increment by 1. What is the change in y? It looks like y changes exactly by 4. It looks like my delta y, my change in y, is equal to 4 when my delta x is equal to 1. So change in y over change in x, change in y is 4 when change in x is 1. So the slope is equal to 4. Now what's its y-intercept? Well here we can just look at the graph."
Math,"It looks like it intersects y-axis at y is equal to negative 6, or at the point 0, negative 6. So we know that b is equal to negative 6. So we know the equation of the line. The equation of the line is y is equal to the slope times x plus the y-intercept. I should write that. So minus 6, that is plus negative 6 So that is the equation of our line. Let's do one more of these. So they tell us that f of 1.5 is negative 3, f of negative 1 is 2."
Math,"What is that? Well, all this is just a fancy way of telling you that the point when x is 1.5, when you put 1.5 into the function, the function evaluates as negative 3. So this tells us that the coordinate 1.5, negative 3 is on the line. Then this tells us that the point when x is negative 1, f of x is equal to 2. This is just a fancy way of saying that both of these two points are on the line, nothing unusual."
Math,"I think the point of this problem is to get you familiar with function notation, for you to not get intimidated if you see something like this. If you evaluate the function at 1.5, you get negative 3. So that's the coordinate if you imagine that y is equal to f of x. So this would be the y-coordinate. It would be equal to negative 3 when x is 1.5. Anyway, I've said it multiple times. Let's figure out the slope of this line."
Math,"The slope which is change in y over change in x is equal to, let's start with 2 minus this guy, negative 3-- these are the y-values-- over, all of that over, negative 1 minus this guy. Let me write it this way, negative 1 minus that guy, minus 1.5. I do the colors because I want to show you that the negative 1 and the 2 are both coming from this, that's why I use both of them first. If I used these guys first, I would have to use both the x and the y first."
Math,"If I use the 2 first, I have to use the negative 1 first. That's why I'm color-coding it. So this is going to be equal to 2 minus negative 3. That's the same thing as 2 plus 3. So that is 5. Negative 1 minus 1.5 is negative 2.5. 5 divided by 2.5 is equal to 2. So the slope of this line is negative 2. Actually I'll take a little aside to show you it doesn't matter what order I do this in. If I use this coordinate first, then I have to use that coordinate first. Let's do it the other way."
Math,"If I did it as negative 3 minus 2 over 1.5 minus negative 1, this should be minus the 2 over 1.5 minus the negative 1. This should give me the same answer. This is equal to what? Negative 3 minus 2 is negative 5 over 1.5 minus negative 1. That's 1.5 plus 1. That's over 2.5. So once again, this is equal the negative 2. So I just wanted to show you, it doesn't matter which one you pick as the starting or the endpoint, as long as you're consistent. If this is the starting y, this is the starting x."
Math,"If this is the finishing y, this has to be the finishing x. But anyway, we know that the slope is negative 2. So we know the equation is y is equal to negative 2x plus some y-intercept. Let's use one of these coordinates. I'll use this one since it doesn't have a decimal in it. So we know that y is equal to 2. So y is equal to 2 when x is equal to negative 1. Of course you have your plus b. So 2 is equal to negative 2 times negative 1 is 2 plus b."
Math,"If you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, minus 2, minus 2, you're subtracting it from both sides of this equation, you're going to get 0 on the left-hand side is equal to b. So b is 0. So the equation of our line is just y is equal to negative 2x. Actually if you wanted to write it in function notation, it would be that f of x is equal to negative 2x. I kind of just assumed that y is equal to f of x. But this is really the equation. They never mentioned y's here."
Math,So you could just write f of x is equal to 2x right here. Each of these coordinates are the coordinates of x and f of x. So you could even view the definition of slope as change in f of x over change in x. These are all equivalent ways of viewing the same thing..
Math,"Because no matter how much we change x, y is not changing. y is a constant, 2. So your change in y between any two points is going to be 0. It doesn't matter what your change in x is, your change in x could be 1, your change in x could be 4, your change in y is always 0. So y is not changing as you change x. So your slope for this relationship is actually 0. Y is equal to 0x plus-- and then, you could just realize that the equation of this is just that y is always equal to 2."
Math,"So it's 0x plus 2, which is the same thing as y is equal to 2. You could substitute back in. You could say OK, well, if y is equal to 0x plus b, that means that y is equal to b. Well, y is always equal to 2, no matter what thing you pick, so b is equal to 2. So either way, this just boils down to y is equal to 0x plus 2, or y is just equal to 2. Let's do another one of these. Maybe one where the y is actually changing. So here, the y is clearly actually changing. So let me copy and paste this."
Math,"I want to put on my scratch pad. We can work it out. So we'll stick it right over here. And then we are told a line goes through the-- OK, so same thing. The line goes through these points with the equation of a line. So the main idea here is, you only need 2 points for an equation of line. They've given us more than necessary. So I'd like to pick the two points that make things a little bit simpler. So I'll pick the point 4, 2 and 7, 0."
Math,"I just picked those two points because they have nice, clean numbers associated with it. So what is our change in x here? So our change in x here, if we go from 4 to 7, our change in x is equal to 3. And what's our change in y here? So we went up from 4 to 7. We increased by 3. Our y decreased by 2. Change in y is equal to negative 2. So our slope, which is equal to change in y over change in x, is equal to negative 2/3."
Math,"And if you wanted to relate that to the formulas that you normally see for slope, you're just looking at your end point. So this is y2 minus y1, which is negative 2 over x2 minus x1, which is 7 minus 4. But that just boils down to negative 2/3. And so our equation is going to be y is equal to negative 2/3 x plus b. So let's substitute one of these points in here, to figure out what our b must be. And once again, I want to figure out something where this is going to become nice and clean."
Math,"But this isn't going to be really clean for any of these numbers right over here. If we had a 3 for x, or a 6 for x, or a 0 for x, then things would work out nicely. But they don't give us any of those. So let's just try the 7 and the 0. So when x is equal to 0-- sorry, when x is equal to 7-- y is equal to 0. So when x is equal to 7, I'll just do it in the same color, y is equal to 0. So 0 is equal to negative 2/3 times 7 plus b, or 0 is equal to negative 14/3 plus b."
Math,"Add 14/3 to both sides, you get 14/3 is equal to b. So this is going to be y is equal to negative-- I'm going to go back to the other screen-- so y is equal to negative 2/3 x plus 14/3. So let me do that. So y is equal to negative 2/3 x plus 14/3. Let's check our answer. We got it right.."
Math,"And the name of a function, f tends to be the most-used variable. But we'll see that you can use others-- is equal to, let's say, x squared, if x is even. And let's say it is equal to x plus 5, if x is odd. What would happen if we input 2 into this function? The way that we would denote inputting 2 is that we would want to evaluate f of 2. This is saying, let's input 2 into our function f."
Math,"And everywhere we see this x here, this variable-- you can kind of use as a placeholder-- let's replace it with our input. So let's see. If 2 is even, do 2 squared. If 2 is odd, do 2 plus 5. Well, 2 is even, so we're going to do 2 squared. In this case, f of 2 is going to be 2 squared, or 4. Now what would f of 3 be? Well, once again, everywhere we see this variable, we'll replace it with our input. So f of 3, 3 squared if 3 is even, 3 plus 5 if 3 is odd. Well, 3 is odd, so it's going to be 3 plus 5."
Math,"It is going to be equal to 8. You might say, OK, that's neat, Sal. This was kind of an interesting way to define a function, a way to kind of munch on these numbers. But I could have done this with traditional equations in some way, especially if you allowed me to use the squirrelly bracket thing. What can a function do that maybe my traditional toolkits might have not been as expressive about? Well, you could even do a function like this."
Math,"Let me not use f and x anymore, just to show you that the notation is more general than that. I could say h of a is equal to the next largest number that starts with the same letter as variable a. And we're going to assume that we're dealing in English. Given that, what is h of 2 going to be? Well, 2 starts with a T. What's the next largest number that starts with a T? Well, it's going to be equal to 3."
Math,"Now what would h of-- I don't know, let's think about this, h of 8 be equal to? Well, 8 starts with an E. The next largest number that starts with an E-- it's not 9, 10-- it would be 11. And so now you see it's a very, very, very general tool. This h function that we just defined, we'll look at it. We'll look at the letter that the number starts with in English. So it's doing this really, really, really, really wacky thing. Now not all functions have to be this wacky."
Math,"In fact, you have already been dealing with functions. You have seen things like y is equal to x plus 1. This can be viewed as a function. We could write this as y is a function of x, which is equal to x plus 1. If you give as an input-- let me write it this way-- for example, when x is 0 we could say f of 0 is equal to, well, you take 0. You add 1. It's equal to 1. f of 2 is equal to 2. You've already done this before."
Math,"You've done things where you said, look, let me make a table of x and put our y's there. When x is 0, y is 1. I'm sorry. I made a little mistake. Where f of 2 is equal to 3. And you've done this before with tables where you say, look, x and y. When x is 0, y is 1. When x is 2, y is 3. You might say, well, what was the whole point of using the function notation here to say f of x is equal to x plus 1? The whole point is to think in these more general terms."
Math,"For something like this, you didn't really have to introduce function notations. But it doesn't hurt to introduce function notations because it makes it very clear that the function takes an input, takes my x-- in this definition it munches on it. It says, OK, x plus 1. And then it produces 1 more than it. So here, whatever the input is, the output is 1 more than that original function. Now I know what you're asking. All right."
Math,"Well, what is not a function then? Well, remember, we said a function is something that takes an input and produces only one possible output for that given input. For example-- and let me look at a visual way of thinking about a function this time, or a relationship, I should say-- let's say that's our y-axis, and this right over here is our x-axis. Let me draw a circle here that has radius 2. So it's a circle of radius 2. This is negative 2. This is positive 2. This is negative 2."
Math,"So my circle, it's centered at the origin. It has radius 2. That's my best attempt at drawing the circle. Let me fill it in. So this is a circle. The equation of this circle is going to be x squared plus y squared is equal to the radius squared, is equal to 2 squared, or it's equal to 4. The question is, is this relationship between x and y-- here I've expressed it as an equation."
Math,"Here I've visually drawn all of the x's and y's that satisfy this equation-- is this relationship between x and y a function? And we can see visually that it's not going to be a function. You pick a given x. Let's say x is equal to 1. There's two possible y's that are associated with it, this y up here and this y down here. We could even solve for that by looking at the equation. When x is equal to 1, we get 1 squared plus y squared is equal to 4. 1 plus y squared is equal to 4."
Math,"Or subtracting 1 from both sides, y squared is equal to 3. Or y is equal to the positive or the negative square root of 3. This right over here is the positive square root of 3, and this right over here is the negative square root of 3. So this situation, this relationship where I inputted a 1 into my little box here, and associated with the 1, I associate both a positive square root of 3 and a negative square root of 3, this is not a function. I cannot associate with my input two different outputs."
Math,I can only have one output for a given input..
Math,"In this case, our input is going to be our 5. We input it into our little function box, and we need to get our output. And they defined the function box here as whatever your input is, take that, square it, and then subtract it from 49. So f of 5, every time I see an x here, since f of x is equal to this, every time I see an x, I would replace it with the input. So f of 5 is going to be equal to 49 minus-- instead of writing x squared, I would write 5 squared. So this is equal to 49 minus 25."
Math,And 49 minus 25 is equal to 24. And we are done..
Math,"So let's rewrite it. Volume as a function of radius is equal to 4/3 pi r cubed. Now, they say the balloons he bought can stretch to a radius of 3 inches. So let's think about, if the radius gets to 3 inches, what the volume of that balloon is going to be. So we essentially would just input 3 inches into our function definition. So everywhere where we see an r, we would replace it with a 3. So we could write-- and just to be clear, let me rewrite it in the same color. V of-- that's not the same color."
Math,"We do it in that brownish color right over here. So V of 3 is equal to 4/3 pi-- and instead of r cubed, I would write 3 cubed-- 4/3 pi 3 cubed. This is how the function definition works. Whatever we input here, it will replace the r in the expression. So V of 3 is going to be equal to-- so this is going to be equal to 4/3 pi times-- 3 to the third power is 27. 27 divided by 3 is 9, so this is 9. 9 times 4 is 36 pi. So this is equal to 36 pi."
Math,"And since this was in inches, our volume is going to be in inches cubed or cubic inches. So that's the volume of water that Frank can put in the balloon-- 36 pi cubic inches.."
Math,"It tells us, given the allowed inputs into our function, what would the function output? So here, they're saying, look, what gets output when we input x is equal to negative 1? So x equals negative 1 is right over here. x is equal to negative 1. And our function graph is right at 6 when f is equal to negative 1. So we can say that f of negative 1 is equal to 6. Let me write that over here. f of negative 1 is equal to 6.."
Math,"JESSE ROE: Yeah, as a teaching fellow I've been helping with organizing and developing new content, mostly on the exercise side of the site. SALMAN KHAN: And the reason why we're doing this right now is you had some very interesting ideas or questions. JESSE ROE: Yeah, so as an algebra teacher, when I introduce that concept of algebra to students, I get a lot of questions."
Math,"One of those questions is, what's the difference between an equation and a function? SALMAN KHAN: The difference between an equation verses a function, that's an interesting question. Let's pause it and let the viewers try to think about it a little bit. And then maybe we'll give a stab at it. JESSE ROE: Sounds great. So Sal, how would you answer this question? What's the difference between an equation and a function? SALMAN KHAN: Let me think about it a little bit. So let me think."
Math,"I think there's probably equations that are not functions and functions that are not equations. And then there are probably things that are both. So let me think of it that way. So I'm going to draw-- if this is the world of equations right over here, so this is equations. And then over here is the world of functions. That's the world of functions. I do think there is some overlap. We'll think it through where the overlap is, the world of functions."
Math,"So an equation that is not a function that's sitting out here, a simple one would be something like x plus 3 is equal to 10. I'm not explicitly talking about inputs and outputs or relationship between variables. I'm just stating an equivalence. The expression x plus 3 is equal to 10. So this, I think, traditionally would just be an equation, would not be a function. Functions essentially talk about relationships between variables."
Math,"You get one or more input variables, and we'll give you only one output variable. I'll put value. And you can define a function. And I'll do that in a second. You could define a function as an equation, but you can define a function a whole bunch of ways. You can visually define a function, maybe as a graph-- so something like this. And maybe I actually mark off the values. So that's 1, 2, 3. Those are the potential x values."
Math,"And then on the vertical axis, I show what the value of my function is going to be, literally my function of x. And maybe that is 1, 2, 3. And maybe this function is defined for all non-negative values. So this is 0 of x. And so let me just draw-- so this right over here, at least for what I've drawn so far, defines that function. I didn't even have to use an equal sign. If x is 2, at least the way I drew it, y is equal to 3. You give me that input. I gave you the value of only one output."
Math,"So that would be a legitimate function definition. Another function definition would be very similar to what you do in a computer program, something like, let's say, that you input the day of the week. And if day is equal to Monday, maybe you output cereal. So that's what we're going to eat that day. And otherwise, you output meatloaf. So this would also be a function. We only have one output. For any one day of the week, we can only tell you cereal or meatloaf."
Math,"There's no days where you are eating both cereal and meatloaf, which sounds repulsive. And then if I were to think about something that could be an equation or a function, I guess the way I think about it is an equation is something that could be used to define a function. So for example, we could say that y is equal to 4x minus 10. This is a potential definition for defining y as a function of x. You give me any value of x. Then I can find the corresponding value of y."
Math,So this is at least how I would think about it..
Math,"And the F is the Fahrenheit temperature. So right now, it's expressed in terms of, we've solved for C in terms of F. Now we want to solve for F in terms of C. So let's see how we're going to do that. So I'll just rewrite it. C is equal to 5/9 times F minus 32. And we want to solve for F. So the first useful thing to do might be to get rid of this 5/9 from both sides, or at least from the right side of the equation, so we just have an F minus 32."
Math,"And the easiest way to do that is to multiply by the inverse of 5/9. So if we multiply both sides of this equation by 9/5-- and I could put it here, but it'll squeeze a little tight, let me try it-- 9/5 in there. If I do it to the right-hand side of the equation, I also have to do it to the left-hand side of the equation."
Math,"And what do I get? The left-hand side becomes 9/5 Celsius, or the Celsius temperature, 9/5 times the Celsius temperature, is equal to-- the whole reason we wanted to multiply the right side by 9/5 is these 9's cancel out, this 5 cancels out, and this just becomes a 1. So 9/5 times the Celsius temperature is going to be equal to this expression: the Fahrenheit temperature minus 32. We don't need the parentheses anymore, because this is the only expression on the right-hand side."
Math,"Now, we want to solve for the Fahrenheit temperature. So let's see if we can get rid of this 32 from the right-hand side. The easiest way I know how to do that is to add 32. Add 32 to both sides of this equation. Add 32 to both sides. The left-hand side now becomes 9/5 times the Celsius temperature, plus 32. And that's going to be equal to-- this negative 32 and positive 32 cancel out, that was the whole point behind adding 32, so it's just going to be equal to F. And we're done."
Math,"We have rewritten this formula, up here, so it solves for Fahrenheit. This is the Fahrenheit right here. We've solved for Fahrenheit in terms of the Celsius temperature.."
Math,"if we're given a ""b"", what ""a"" does that imply that we have to output? Or another way to think about it is -- let's just solve for a, or we could think about a as being a function of b. So let's write this. So we have 4a plus 7b -- is equal to negative 52. So I can solve for a in terms of b, that any b that I have -- Let's say these b's are on the right hand side I put it in. I can substitute that value for b and I can just solve for a. I can solve for a that needs to be outputted. So let's do that."
Math,"Let's solve for a.  So I want to get all the a on I wanna just have an a leftover on the left hand side, and have everything else on the right hand side including the b's. So let's get rid of this b on the left hand side. And I can do that by subtracting 7b. Of course I wanna do that to both sides. I can't just do an equation and do an operation only on one side like that. So let's subtract, and we are left with we are left with -- the 7b's add up to zero. 7b minus 7b."
Math,"We're left with 4a is equal to negative 52 minus 7b, minus 7b. Now, to isolate the a here, just to have an a here instead of 4a, we can divide both sides by 4. We can divide both sides by 4. So I'm gonna divide everything by 4. And on the left hand side, we got our goal. We are left with an a is equal to -- Now what's negative 54 divided by -- What is the negative 52 divided by 4? So let's think about it. 52 is 40 plus 12. 40 divided by 4 is 10. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So it's gonna be 13. Negative 13."
Math,"So it's negative 13 minus 7/4 b minus 7/4 b. So given a ""b"", if you give me a ""b"", I can put that value right over here, and I can calculate what the corresponding a needs to be in order to satisfy this relationship. So if I want a formula for f of b in terms of b, I can say, look, you give me a ""b"", the output of our function, which is f of a."
Math,"The output of our function is going to be -- is going to be negative 13 minus 7/4 b, because the output of our function needs to be an ""a"" that will satisfy -- that will satisfy this equation up here. So hopefully that helped.."
Math,"So, if the price is low, you would expect that a lot of poeple are willing to buy that thing they're like ""Oh it's a good price, i would like to buy it."" So, if the price is low, then the demand would be high so maybe it would be somplace over here, all the way that you would have really high demand if the price was zero. so if the price was low the demand would be high."
Math,"Now what happens is the price -- so right here the price is low, demand is high, if the price were to go up a little bit then maybe the demand goes down a little bit, right? price went up a little bit demand went down a little bit. if the price went up a little bit more then maybe demand goes down a little bit more."
Math,"as the price went up a bunch then demand would go down a bunch and so the line that represents how the demand relates to price might look something like this, and i'm just going to assume it's it a line. It might not be a line, it might be a curve. It might look something like that. Or it might look something like that. But in general is someone were to ask you, if you saw this magenta curve that as price increases what happens to demand."
Math,"You just say ""Well look price increases, as price increases what happens to demand?"" Well demand is decreasing. Now let's think about a different scenario. Let's talk about the demand for real estate. For actual property, and lets say that on this axis that we plot the population. The population in the area, and this right over here this is demand for land. So when the population is very low, you can imagine, if the population is zero there is no one there that would want to buy land."
Math,"So if the population is very low the demand is going to be very low. And as population increases, demand should increase. If the population increases, more people are going to want to buy land. And if the population goes up a bunch then a lot of people are going to want to buy land. So you'll see a line that looks something like this. And once again I drew a line, it doesn't have to be a line it could be a curve of some kind."
Math,"It could be a curve that looks something like that, or a curve that looks something like that. We don't know but the general idea is that if someone showed you a graph that looked like this. And as population increases what happens to demand. We'll you'd say ""Look, this is population increasing, what happens to demand?"" Demand is going up. Where as price increased the demand went down. Here as population is increasing demand went up. And you can just make that more general with variables."
Math,"We're talking about specific cases here. But if I were to plot something like this, if you were to see a graph that looked like that and this is the variable x and this is the variable y. And someone were to ask you what happens to y as x increases. Well you take any x that's the y that we have for that x. And as you increase x, as you move in the positive horizontal directions. As you increase x what is happening to y? Y is going up. So for this example, as x increases y is increasing."
Math,"If we had a graph that looked like this. Let's call that the a axis and this is the b axis and maybe our graph looked like this. What happens as A increases? If you pick an A right over here. We're at that A and that B. As A increases what's happening to B? Well as A increases our B is lower. As A increases here B is decreasing. So, just wanting to give you a general idea, when X and Y increased together the line goes from the bottom left to the top right, we would call this an upward sloping line."
Math,"We would call this a positive slope. Everytime X is increased Y also increases is upwards sloping. When our independant variable increases and our dependent variable decreases. When the independent variable is increasing, then you say it has a downward slope, when you go from the top left to the bottom right.."
Math,"The number of cats in Jordan's house, C, as a function of time since she moved in days, T, is plotted below. So this Jordan, she just keeps adopting cats. Her house is just getting more and more and more full of cats. I guess that's got to stop at some point. But for this question, they just say she keeps adopting them at a constant rate. So let's look at the choices here and see which of these statements is true. Jordan had 10 cats when she moved. So let's see this is time from when she moved in."
Math,"So time equals 0 is right when she moved in her house. And it does look like, yes, she had 10 cats right where she moved in. So that first part of the statement is true. And after moving, she adopted 2 cats each day. So let's see the rate at which she's adopting cats. And I'm going to find another point on here. So we know that the point 0 comma 10 is on here. So on day 0, when time equals 0, she already had 10 cats, which seems to be more than enough for me. But let's see how many she gets to."
Math,"So all of these other ones, it's hard to read. Well, it looks like here, this is definitely on day 15. On day 15, she had 40 cats. So let's see. After 15 days, when her change in time was 15, what was the change in her number of cats? Well, she went from 10 cats to 40 cats. So she went up to her change in the number of cats-- and we could call that delta C-- is equal to-- she went from 10 to 40. Her change in cats is 30. So her change in cats over change in time is 30 over 15."
Math,"Or you could say, 2 cats per unit time, per day. So it does look like she got 2 cats per day. After 15 days at 2 cats a day, she had 30 more cats. She went from 10 to 40. So this statement looks right. And this one is multiple choice. So these other ones are probably wrong. But let's verify that. Jordan had 3 cats when she moved. Well, that's not true. 3 would have been right around here. So that's not right. Jordan had 10 cats when she moved. And after moving, she adopted 1 cat every 2 days."
Math,"Well, that would be 1/2 a cat a day. And we know that that's not the case. She adopted 2 cats a day. After 15 days, she had 30 cats. So this isn't right either. Jordan had 3 cats where she moved. Well, we already know that that's not the case. So we know it's the first choice.."
Math,"Zane's elevation relative to the edge of the inside of the volcano in meters, E, as a function of time in seconds is shown in the table below. Zane climbs at a constant rate. So this guy, I mean if we were to draw a volcano here, this guy is just kind of silly. So this is my volcano. And he's actually climbing on the inside of an active volcano. So there's probably smoke and ash and all the other stuff coming out of this thing. So this really is dangerous for him."
Math,"And let's say that this right over here is Zane. He's climbing up from inside the active volcano. So let's think about what they're telling us. So based on the table, which of these statements is true? So I'm not going to even look at these statements here. I'm just going to try to interpret this. So his elevation as a function of time in seconds is shown in the table below. So his elevation is negative 24 when time is equal to 0. And this table is done in a kind of nontraditional way."
Math,"Normally, we would have the input into the function on the left-hand side. And then we would have the function of it on the right-hand side. And actually I like looking at things that way, so I'm going to make it like that. So let me copy and paste this so I can put it on the other side. So let me cut and let me paste it, paste it right over here. So this one, now I can think of it a little bit clearer. So at time 0, he's going to be at negative 24 meters."
Math,"At time 4 seconds, he's going to be at negative 21 meters. So this makes a little bit clearer, at least in my head. So let's think about what's happening. So where does he start? At time equals 0, where is he? Well at time equals 0, he is 24 meters below the edge of the volcano. So this distance at time equals 0, this distance right over here is 24 meters. And we could even plot this in a graph. So this is his elevation relative to the edge, and it is a function of time. I'll write it like that."
Math,"And it is negative most of this time. So I'm going to make the t-axis a little bit higher. So it looks something like that. That's our t-axis. And when t is equal to 0, we see that his elevation is negative 24 meters. So his elevation is negative 24 meters. So he's going to, this is right here at 0 seconds. And then when time increases by 4, so our change in time is equal to 4, what's his change in elevation? Well, his change in elevation is, let's see, he's going from negative 24 to negative 21."
Math,"He increased by 3. So his change in elevation is equal to positive 3. He increased by 3. So at what rate is he increasing his elevation with respect to time? Well, change in elevation is equal to 3 per unit. And that's 3 when his change in time. And remember this triangle just means a Greek letter delta, shorthand for change in. So change in elevation over change in times is 3 over 4. So one way to think about this is that he goes 3/4 of a meter per second. The units up here is meter."
Math,"The units down here is second. So he goes 3/4 of a meter per second. And we can verify that. The next row here, we see our change in time is 8. So it's twice as much time has passed, so he should have gone twice as much distance if his rate is constant. Let's verify that that's the case. So he went from negative 21 to negative 15. His elevation increased by 6. So change in elevation over change in time is 6/8, which is the same thing as 3/4. So you see that he has this constant change."
Math,"So let's plot a few of these points. So when time is 0, his elevation is negative 24. When time is 4, right over there, his elevation is negative 21. Let's say this looks something like this. And so his elevation as a function of time is going to look something like this. Let me actually draw it a little bit more to scale. Because the other thing that we do know is that when time is 32, his elevation is 0. So let me put that right over there. When time is 32, his elevation is 0."
Math,So his elevation as a function of time looks something like this. And we could plot other points there when time is 4. So 4 is going to be at this half. That's a 4. So 4 is going to be right over there. His elevation is negative 21. So this is a general idea. He starts at negative 24 meters and he increases at a rate of 3/4 meters per second.
Math,"So which of these choices is correct? Zane was 24 meters below the edge of the volcano when he decided to leave, and he climbs 3 meters every 4 seconds on the way out. That seems right. He climbs 3 meters every 4 seconds. So we're going to go with that one. Let's make sure that these aren't right. Zane was 24 meters below the volcano when he decided to leave, and he climbs 4 meters every 3 seconds. No, no, it's 3 meters every 4 seconds. So that's not right. Zane was 32 meters below the edge of the volcano."
Math,"No, that's not right. Zane was 32 meters. That's not right either.."
Math,"And then they tell us how much money do we make in each of those time periods. If we work four hours, we make $54, if we work eight hours, we make $108, so forth and so on. And then they say what does the slope represent in this situation? So we have to find the slope and figure out what it represents. So just as a bit of review, slope just equals the change in the dependent variable divided by the change in the independent variable."
Math,"So how much does a dependent variable change for any amount of change of the independent variable? In this situation, the dependent variable is the amount of money you make because it is dependent on how much time you work, this is independent. So let's call the independent variable x, the dependent variable y. So our slope in this situation would be change in y divided by change in x."
Math,"So how much does the amount of money I make change when I work a certain number of hours, when my hours worked change by a certain amount. So let's just take some data points here. We could take really any of these data points, I'll take some of the smaller numbers. So let's say if when I go from four to eight hours, so my change in x is going to be what? If I go from four to eight, might change in x is going to be eight minus four, four hours, right? So this is going to be my change in x."
Math,"I'm just picking these two points, I could have picked four and forty if I wanted, but the math would become more complicated. But how much does the amount of money earn change if I go from four hours to eight hours? Well, I go from $54 to $108, so the difference in the amount of money I make is $108 minus $54. So what is my change in my dependent variable? Well, that's going to be $108 minus $54, that's just $54."
Math,"And then what was the change in the amount of hours I worked? Well, the change in the hours I worked was four hours. So, if I work four more hours, I make 54 more dollars. Let me put a little equal sign there. So what is 54 divided by four? So four goes into 54-- looks like there's going to be decimal here-- four goes into five one time, one times four is four. Subtract, you get five minus four is one, bring down this four you get 14. Four goes into 14 three times, three times four is 12."
Math,"Fourteen minus 12 is two, bring down a 0 right here, four goes into 20 five times. And of course you have this decimal right here. Five times four is 20. Subtract, no remainder. So this is equal to 13.5, but since we're talking in terms of dollars, maybe say $13.50, because that's our numerator, right? This is money earned, dollars per hour, because that's our denominator, dollars per hour. So that essentially answers our question."
Math,"What does the slope represent in this situation? It represents the hourly wage for working at wherever this might be. Frankly, for this problem, you didn't even have to take two data points. We could have said hey, if you work four hours and make $54, 54 divided by four is 13.50. Or we could have said hey, if we work eight hours, we get $108, 108 divided by eight is 13.50. So you didn't even have to take two data points here, you could have just taken any of these numbers divided by any of these numbers."
Math,But hopefully we also learned a little bit about what slope is..
Math,"2 more inches melted by Wednesday morning. This pattern continued throughout the week until no more snow was left. So they're essentially saying that we had 12 inches of snow on the ground on Monday and that every day after that, two inches melted. So after Tuesday, you'd have 10 inches, and after Wednesday, you'd have eight inches, and that pattern continued. And what they say is create an equation and a graph to show the relationship between the day and the amount of snow on the ground."
Math,"So let's define a variable that tells us how far away we are from Monday. So let's let x equal days after Monday. And then let y be equal to inches of snow on the ground. So, one way to think about it is, OK, when x is 0, when we're on Monday, when we're 0 days after Monday, we're going to have 12 inches of snow on the ground, and every day after that, we're going to lose two inches."
Math,"So if we're on Tuesday, we're going to have 2 inches times 1, because Tuesday is one day, so if x is 1, that means we're on Tuesday. If x is 2, that means we're 2 times 2, we've lost 4 inches, which is what the case is on Wednesday. So this is our equation for the relationship between the day and the amount of snow on the ground. x is the day, how many days after Monday, and then y is the inches of the snow left on the ground. We start with 12, and then every day we lose exactly two inches."
Math,"Now let's graph this. So I'll make my vertical axis the y-axis, that's inches on the ground. y is equal to inches left on the ground. And then the horizontal axis, that is our x-axis-- let me scroll down a little bit-- this is days after Monday. And so we have 0 days after Monday, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. And then on Monday, which is exactly 0 days after Monday, that is Monday, we have 12 inches on the ground. So I'll do it up here, so we have 12 inches on the ground right there."
Math,"And actually, I could do a table if you like. Let me draw this. So if we do x and y, this is the days after Monday, so there's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And then on the first day, we have 12 inches, on Monday, 0 days after Monday. Then we lose two inches each day. On day 1 we have 10, day 2, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0. So let's plot these points. We already plotted 0, 12 in that blue color. Now let's plot 1, 10. 1, 10 is right about there. It'll be right over there. Then we can plot 2, 8."
Math,"So 2 days after Monday, we have 8 inches left on the ground. So this is on Wednesday, so that's 8 inches. And then on 3 days after Monday, we have 6 inches on the ground. You can see that a line is forming here. And then if we go to 4 days after Monday, we have 4 inches on the ground. So that is 4. And then 5 days after Monday, we have 2 inches on the ground. And then finally, on the sixth day, 6 days after Monday-- so what are we at, Sunday now-- we are going to have no inches on the ground."
Math,"So that's that right there. And you can see that there's this line that formed, because this is a linear relationship. It looks a little curvy because I didn't draw it perfectly, but that is a line. So we've done everything. We've created the equation. We start with 12 inches, every day after that we lose two inches. And we showed a graph that depicts the relationship.."
Math,"I really just want you to get the conceptual understanding of what it means to fit data with line, or do a linear regression. So here, let's just read the problem. The following table shows the median California income-- remember median is the middle, the middle California income --from 1995 to 2002 as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. Draw a scatter plot and find the equation."
Math,What would you expect the median annual income of a California family to be in the year 2010? What are the meanings of the slope and the y-intercept of this problem? So the first thing you'd want to do-- I just copied and pasted this image --we have to get the data in a form that the spreadsheet can understand it. So let's make some tables here. Let's say years since 1995. Let's make that one column. Let me make this a little bit wider. Then let me put median income.
Math,"This is the median income in California for a family. So we start off with 1 year, or 0 years since 1995, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Actually if you want, it'll figure out the trend if you just keep going down. It'll figure out you're just incrementing by 1. Then the income, I'll just copy in these numbers right there. So that's $53,807, $55,217, $55,209, $55,415 $63,100, $63,206, $63,761, and then we have $65,766. So I don't need these over here. So I'm going to get rid of them. I can clear them."
Math,"So let me make sure I have enough entries. This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 entries. I want to make sure I got my data right. $53,807, $55,217, $55,209, 415, 100, 206, 761, 766. OK, there we go. Now you're going to find that in Excel this is incredibly easy if you know what to click on. One, plot this data, create a scatter plot, and then even better, create a regression of that data. So all you have to do is you select the data."
Math,"Then you go to insert, and I'm going to insert a scatter plot. Then you can pick the different types of scatter plots. I just want to plot the data. There you go. It plotted the data for me. There you go. If you go by this is the actual income, and this is by year since 1995. So this is 1995. It was $53,807. In 1996 it's $55,217. So it plotted all the data. Now what I want to do is fit a line. So this isn't exactly a line."
Math,"But let's see, if we assume that a line can model this data well, I'm going to get Excel to fit a line for me. So what I can do is I have all of these options up here for different ways to fit a line, all of these different options. I'm going to pick this one here. You might not be able to see it. It looks like it has a line between dots. It also has fx which tells me going to tell me the equation of the line. So if I click on that, there you go."
Math,"It not only fit, it replotted that same data on a different graph. Let me make it a little bit bigger. No, I don't want to that. Let me make it a little bit bigger. We can cover up the data now, just because I think we know what's going on. So let me cover it up right like that. So not only did it plot the various data points, it actually fit a line to that data and it gave me the equation of that line. Let me see if I can make this a little bit bigger."
Math,"I'll move it out of the way so you can read it at least. So it tells me right here, that the equation for this line is y is equal to 1,882.3x plus 52,847. So if you remember what we know about slope and y-intercept, the y-intercept is 52,847, which is, if you use this line as your measure, where this line intersects at year 0, or in 1995. So if you use this line as a model, in 1995 the line would say that you're going to make $52,847. The actual data was a little bit off of that."
Math,"It was a little bit higher, $53,807. So it was a little bit higher. But we're trying to get a line that gets as close as possible to all of this data. It's actually trying to minimize the distance, the square of the distance, between each of these points in the line. We won't go into the math there. But it gave us this nice equation. Now we can use this nice equation to predict things."
Math,"If we say that this is a good a model for the data-- let me bring this down a little bit --let's try to answer our question. So we drew a scatter plot-- really Excel did it for us. We found the equation right there. They say, what would you expect the median annual income of a California family to be in the year 2010? So here, we can just use the equation they gave us. This right here, was 2002. So I could write down the year. This was the year of 2002. So the year 2010 is 8 more years."
Math,"Let me make a little column here. So this is the year, 1995, 1996. Then Excel will be able to figure out if I select those, and I go to this little bottom right square and I scroll down, Excel will actually figure out that I want to increment by 1 year every time. If I say years since 1995, once again I can just continue this trend right here. So 2010 would be 15 years. So we can just apply this equation."
Math,"We could say it's going to be equal to, according to this line-- I'm just going to type it in, hopefully you can read what I'm saying --1,882.3 times x. x here is the year since 1995. I could just select this cell, or I could type in the number 15. That means times this cell, times 15. Then plus 52,847, plus that right there. Click enter and it predicts $81,081.50. So if you just continue this line for another 8 or so years, it predicts that the median income in California for a family will be $81,000."
Math,"Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting. Spreadsheets are very useful tools for manipulating data. It'll give you a sense of why linear models are interesting, why lines are interesting, and how you can actually use these tools to interpret data and maybe even extrapolate some type of a prediction. This right here, is an extrapolation using this linear regression.."
Math,"So this right over here is g of x. And that also looks like a linear function. We see it's a kind of a downward sloping line. So let's look at our choices and see which of these are true. f and g are both increasing, and f is increasing faster than g. Well, when I look at g-- Well, first of all, g is definitely decreasing. So we already know that that's false. And f is also decreasing. We see here it has a negative slope."
Math,"Every time we move forward 3 in the x direction, we're going to move down 7 in the vertical direction. So neither of these are increasing so that's definitely not right. f and g are both increasing. Well, that's definitely not right. So we know that both f and g are decreasing. So this first choice says they're both decreasing, and g is decreasing faster than f. So let's see what the slope on g is."
Math,"So the slope on g is every time we move 1 in the x direction, positive 1 in the x direction, we move down 2 in the y direction. So for g of x, if we were to write our change in y over our change in x-- which is our slope-- our change in y over change in x, when we move one in the x direction, positive 1 in the x direction, we move down 2 in the y direction. So our change in y over change in x is negative 2. So g has a slope of negative 2. f has a slope of negative 7/3."
Math,"Negative 7/3 is the same thing as negative 2 and 1/3. So f's slope is more negative. So it is decreasing faster. So g is not decreasing faster than f. f is decreasing faster than g. So this is not right. And then we have this choice-- f and g are both decreasing, and f is decreasing faster than g. This is right, right over here. We have this last choice-- g is increasing but f is decreasing. We know that's not true. g is actually decreasing.."
Math,"So we could just look for which of these lines are increasing at a rate of 7/4, 7 in the vertical direction every time we move 4 in the horizontal direction. And an easy way to eyeball that would actually be just to plot two points for f, and then see what that rate looks like visually. So if we see here when x is 0, f is negative 1. When x is 0, f is negative 1. So when x is 0, f is negative 1. And when x is 4, f is 6, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so just like that. And two points specify a line."
Math,"We know that it is a linear function. You can even verify it here. When we increase by 4 again, we increase our function by 7 again. We know that these two points are on f and so we get a sense of the rate of change of f. Now, when you draw it like that, it immediately becomes pretty clear which of these has the same rate of change of f. A is increasing faster than f. C is increasing slower. A is increasing much faster than f. C is increasing slower than f. B is decreasing, so that's not even close."
Math,"But D seems to have the exact same inclination, the exact same slope, as f. So D is what we would go with. And we could even verify it, even if we didn't draw it in this way. Our change in f for a given change in x is equal to-- when x changed plus 4, our function changed plus 7. It is equal to 7/4. And we can verify that on D, if we increase in the x-direction by 4, so we go from 4 to 8, then in the vertical direction we should increase by 7, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
Math,"And it, indeed, does increase at the exact same rate.."
Math,"Once again, the Greek letter-- this triangle is the Greek letter delta, which is shorthand for ""change in."" So this is the change in f over the change in x. So we see over here, when x changes by 1, the value of our function changes by positive 5. And it's linear, so that's true. Between any two points, the ratio between our change in f and our change in x is the same. If we go up 1 again, we have plus 1 in the x-direction, we are once again increasing by 5."
Math,"If you start from this point and go all the way here, so if you go plus 2 along x, you're going to go plus 10 along f. So it would be 10 over 2, which is still 5. So either way, the slope, or the rate of change of the vertical axis with respect to the horizontal axis, is 5 for f. Now, let's see which of these increase faster. Well, a isn't even increasing. So A is decreasing. As x increases, y is decreasing. So that definitely can't be the case."
Math,"If we look at this one right over here, it looks like-- let's see, if we start over here, if we increase 1 along the x-direction, if our change in x is 1, it looks like our change in y is exactly 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So it looks like for choice B, our slope is exactly 5, or our change in y over change in x is exactly 5. So it's not increasing faster than f. It's increasing the same as f. Now let's look at C. So I'm going to try to find a point where it looks like I have an integer point right over here."
Math,"So that's the point, negative 3, negative 3. And if I move 1 in the x-direction, it looks like I'm increasing by more than 5. I'm increasing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, it looks like. So this one looks like it has a slope of 8. So this one is increasing faster than f, so we'll circle that right over there. And now let's look at this choice. So if we start right over here-- and I just picked this point because that's at a nice integer coordinate. It's at the point 2, negative 4."
Math,"If we increase x by 1, then we increase y by 1, 2, 3-- looks like about 3 and 1/2, definitely not 5. In order for it to increase as fast as f, it would have to increase by 5, so it would have to be up here. So it would have to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It would have had to have been up here. The line would've looked something more like that just to match f, much less grow faster than f. So D does not meet the criteria. It is only C.."
Math,"The table below shows how far some other students are from school at various times. Each person is moving at a constant speed starting at time is equal to 0. Which students started out farther from school than Elizabeth? Select all that apply. So essentially, we need to figure out where these students were at time equals 0. So we know where they were at time 1, 2, and 3. And so let's think about their rate towards or away from school. And remember, this is distance from school."
Math,"As we increase-- as we go from hour 1 to hour 2, Gordon gets 2 miles closer. So his distance to school is decreasing. So where was he at time equals 0? I'll put time equals 0 up here because I don't have any-- actually, I'll put it right here. I'll try to squeeze it into the chart. So where was he at time equals 0? Well, he would have been 2 miles further. So he would have been 6 miles away. Notice that it's consistent. In the first hour, he would have gotten 2 miles closer to school."
Math,"Then the next hour, he would have gotten 2 miles even closer. And then the third hour, he actually gets 2 miles closer. And he actually gets to school. So Gordon started out 6 miles away at t equals 0. So Gordon did start out farther from school than Elizabeth. So we can circle Gordon. He meets the conditions. Now let's think about Giovanni. So at time 1, he's 5 miles away from school. Then at 1 hour, he's 5 miles away. After 2 hours, he's 6 miles away. So he's getting further from school."
Math,"So this is a plus 1. And then after another hour, he is 7 miles away. So every hour that goes by, he's a mile further. He's going 1 mile an hour away from school. So where was he at time equal 0? Well, he would have been a mile closer to school relative to time equal 1. So he would have been 4 miles away. So he did not start out farther than Elizabeth, who started out 5 miles away. Now let's look at Hannah. Hannah, at every time, is just exactly 5 miles away from school. So she's napping or something."
Math,"She is not actually moving. She started out napping at exactly the same distance as Elizabeth, but she did not start out farther from school than Elizabeth. So Hannah does not meet the criteria. Now let's look at Alberto. At time equals 1, he is 9 miles from school. And then after 1 hour, he gets a mile and 1/2 further from school. After another hour, he gets a mile and 1/2 even further. So where was he at time equals 0? Well, he would have been a mile and 1/2 closer to school."
Math,"So 9 minus 1.5 is-- he would have been 7 and 1/2 miles away. So even though he is going away from-- well, he definitely started further from school than Elizabeth. Elizabeth started out 5 miles away. Alberto started off 7 and 1/2 miles away and is going even further and further and further. So the two students that start out farther from school than Elizabeth are Gordon and Alberto.."
Math,"So at 50 seconds, he's 830 meters from work. Then another 50 seconds goes by, and now he's 760 meters from work. Another 50 seconds goes by, and he's 690 meters from work, which makes sense. He's getting closer and closer to work as seconds pass by. He's walking to work. Which of these sentences could possibly be true? Select all that apply. So what are these sentences talking about? So it looks like they're all talking about Tammy."
Math,"Tammy started 830 meters from work and walked towards work at 2 meters per second. She started 900 meters from work and walked towards work at 7/5 meters per second. So all of these seem to be statements about where did Tammy start and how quickly did she walk to work? So let's think about which of these could possibly be true. Well, the one thing that we know is that they live the same distance from work."
Math,"So the distance that Charles started walking from work, that's the same distance that Tammy started walking from work. So let's figure out what that distance is. So we see that every 50 seconds, so if we go from 50 to 100 seconds, so if we add 50 seconds, or 50 seconds go by, it looks like Charles traveled another-- let's see. To go from 830 to 760, his distance from work decreased by 70 meters. And let's see if that keeps holding up. It should because they're moving at constant speeds."
Math,"Another 50 seconds goes by, and his distance from work decreases by another 70 meters. So what would have happened 50 seconds in the past? So what would happen at 0 seconds? So 50 seconds before he's at 830 meters, he would have been 70 meters further from work. So he would have been 900 meters from work, and we see that it's consistent. When 50 seconds pass by, when we go from 0 seconds to 50 seconds, he goes from 900 meters away to 70 meters away. So once again, his distance from work decreases by 70."
Math,"Then another 50 seconds goes by, it decreases by 70 again. Another 50 seconds, it decreases by 70 again. So at time 0, Charles was 900 meters away from work. Now, we know that Tammy and Charles live the same distance away from work. So Tammy would have also started 900 meters away from work. Now, they tell us that they don't necessarily walk at the same speed. So we don't know what Tammy's speed is. This hasn't in any way constrained Tammy's speed. So we know that she started 900 meters away."
Math,"So we know that this can't be the case. That says 830. We know that this can't be the case. We know that this can't be the case because they all talk about starting at a distance other than 900 meters. And over here, both of these, they say she started at 900 meters from work and walked towards work at 7/5 meters per second. Well, that's possible. It's not necessarily true. They just haven't given us information on her speed. But given the information so far, this is definitely a possibility."
Math,"Likewise, Tammy started 900 meters from work-- we know that is true-- and walked towards work at 5/7 meters per second. Well, once again, that's a possibility. That hasn't been ruled out by the information right over here. So these two are both possibly true.."
Math,"Graph the amount of fuel remaining in the truck's tank in liters as a function of distance driven in kilometers. And right over here we have, we have a graph where we have a coordinate plane where our horizontal coordinate is distance in kilometers, and our vertical, our vertical axis is fuel in liters. So we can define the line by moving these two points around, because two points define a line. And so, let's just think about two points that we could figure out."
Math,"Can we figure out the fuel at two different distances, and then that will help us define the line. Well, the first thing that we might want to think about is, well, what about before we've traveled at all? That might be the easy thing to figure out. What was the amount of fuel in the tank when we haven't traveled at all? And they tell us that in this passage. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about that."
Math,"Well, they tell us Karl filled up the tank of his truck with 400 liters of fuel and then set out to deliver a shipment of bananas. So before he had driven at all, right after he'd filled his tank, he had 400 liters of fuel. So we could say when distance was zero kilometers, he had 400 liters of fuel. So we have one point on that line. Now we gotta think about where we might want to put, where we want to put this other point."
Math,"And the way I think about it is, well, let's just, we know he's consuming, he's consuming eight-tenths of a liter of fuel for each kilometer driven. But they don't have, you know, we're not going by one kilometer, two kilometers. They're going by, this is like 50 kilometers, 100 kilometers."
Math,"So let's think about how much fuel he would have consumed after driving 100 kilometers, and if he consumed that much, we would subtract that from the amount of fuel he started with, and then that would tell us, that would tell us where this point would be. It's going to be some place over here, and it's going to be, it's going to be below 400, 'cause we're consuming fuel. Fuel should be going down as distance increases. This should be a downward-sloping line. So I have my, I have my scratchpad here."
Math,"Let me, let me get it out. And I have the same question there. It just gives us all the same information. But what I want to figure out is, so we already know, we already know that. So we have distance, distance. Let me, I'll just write. Actually, let me just write the whole thing. Give myself a little bit more space. Distance in kilometers. Distance in kilometers. And then you have fuel, you have fuel in liters. You have fuel in liters."
Math,"And we already figured out that before he got on, right after he filled up his tank but before he set out on his trip, at distance zero kilometers he had 400 liters of fuel. And we've already actually plotted that. But then we said, well what happens at a hundred kilometers? At a hundred kilometers, how much fuel will he have? Well, they tell us that he consumes 0.8 liters of fuel for each kilometer. So, 0.8 liters per kilometer, and then we just multiply that times the number of kilometers."
Math,"So, times 100 kilometers. The units work out, kilometers divided by kilometers. We're just going to be left with liters, and then we multiply the numbers. Eight-tenths of a hundred, well that's going to be equal to 80, and the units are liters, 80 liters. So at a distance of a hundred kilometers, he's going to have consumed, right, let me be careful here. He's going to have consumed 80 liters. He's going to have consumed 80 liters."
Math,"So the fuel, the fuel is actually going to be what he started with, what he started with minus how much he consumed. So it's going to be minus 0.8, and if we want to write the units there. I might as well, so, you know, this is liters right over here. This is 400 liters. And I can write this kilometers, kilometers. It's going to be 400 liters minus 0.8 liters per kilometer times, times, let me make that clear, times 100, times 100 kilometers."
Math,"And same thing, kilometers divided by kilometers, and we are left with 400 liters minus 0.8 liters times 100. Well, that's just going to be equal to 400 liters, which is how much he started with, minus eight-tenths of a hundred is 80, and the units left is 80 liters. So 400 liters minus 80 liters, that's going to be 320 liters. So when he has traveled a hundred kilometers, he will have 320 liters left in his tank. So let's plot that."
Math,"So when he has traveled a hundred kilometers, actually, I just randomly had put the point there, he is going to have 320 liters left in his tank. And just like that, we have plotted the line that showed how much fuel he has in his tank as a function of, as a function of distance traveled. And you can even see from this that he's going to run out of fuel at the 500-kilometer mark.."
Math,"The water level rose by six centimeters each minute and reached the desired height after 20 minutes. Graph the pool's water level, in centimeters, as a function of time, in minutes. Well, they do tell us one interesting thing. They say that the water level reached the desired height after 20 minutes. And we know what the desired height is, the desired height is to be as tall as, or to be as deep as he is tall, or as high as he is tall. And that is 220 centimeters tall."
Math,"So they're telling us essentially that the water level of the pool after 20 minutes is 220 centimeters, so we can plot that. So after 20 minutes, so we can plot that point right there. After 20 minutes, we are at 220 centimeters. So we would be right there. Now the other question is where would we put this point? We need another data point in order to define a line."
Math,"And so they tell us that the water, you might be tempted to say, ""Okay, maybe the water level was ""at zero to begin with,"" but they didn't tell us that. Maybe when he started filling the pool there was already some water in there. So we have to be a little bit more careful. But they do give us some information. The water level rose by six centimeters each minute, it rose by six centimeters each minute. So at 20 minutes, we know we're at 220."
Math,"And if we rose six centimeters each minute, where would we have been, let's say 10 minutes ago? So, where would we have been at time 10? So, every 10 minutes, if the water level is rising six centimeters a minute, it would be rising 60 centimeters every 10 minutes. So 10 minutes ago, we would be 60 centimeters less. So 60 centimeters less than 220. That's 20 centimeters less, that's 40 centimeters less, that's 60 centimeters less."
Math,"So, if you go back in time 10 minutes, you would be 60 centimeters shallower, or less high, and 220 minus 60 is 160. Now, I think I'm done. I think this describes it. Now let's see if it makes sense. This is telling us that at time zero there was, before he started filling it, there was already 100 centimeters in his pool. And then after 20 minutes, he's done. And is that consistent with six centimeters a minute? Well, based on this, it took him 20 minutes to get to 220, but that's an incremental 120."
Math,"To go from 100 to 220 is 120 more centimeters. So in 20 minutes, he got 120 centimeters. Well 120 centimeters divided by 20 minutes is six centimeters per minute. So this is looking good and we got it right.."
Math,"This is registration. How much will this membership cost a member by the end of the year? So let's figure out an equation that determines how much total we will pay. p is equal to the amount that we're going to pay in total for our membership. So no matter how many months we use the gym, just to start using the gym, we have to pay $200 in registration. I'll just write-- everything we'll assume is in dollars --so I'll write $200. And then we're going to have to pay $39 for every month we're there."
Math,"So then we're going to take the number of months we're there and multiply that times 39. Notice if we stay there 1 month, we'll have to pay 1 month times $39. And we would have already paid the $200 registration fee. So it'll be $239. If we stay 2 months, we pay the $200 registration fee and then we pay 39 times 2 months, which is what? Like 78 or something. So it would be $278. So just to tie this altogether with linear equations and graphs of them, let's graph this relation."
Math,"Remember the graph of a line can be y is equal to mx plus b. That's one of the forms. So to put this line in this form or this equation in this form, we can just rearrange the 39m and the 200 and you get p is equal to 39m plus 200. So what's the slope and what's the y-intercept? You might get confused and say, hey there's an x there and a y, but now you're doing it with p's and m's. Just remember this is the independent variable and this is the dependent variable. Here this is the independent variable."
Math,"How many months? You pick a number of months and I'll tell you what the total cost of your membership is going to be. It's the same thing. This is like the x right there. This is like the y just like that. Just using our pattern match, this right here is the-- we could say it's the vertical intercept or the p-intercept or the-- I'm tempted to call it the y-intercept. But we're really intersecting the p-axis instead of the y-axis there. This right here is our slope. So let's graph this function."
Math,"I won't do it too accurately. I just want to do a hand drawn graph just to give you an idea. We could just stay in the first quadrant. We're not going to stay negative months and the gym is never going to pay us money. So right off the bat, we're going to have to pay the gym $200. $200 for 0 months. Then for every month, we're going to have to spend an extra $39. So the slope is 39. Let's say this is 1 month right there. This is in months. And this axis is price, the p-axis."
Math,"So this is like the p-intercept or the y-intercept. So after 1 month, how much are we going to have to pay? Well our slope is 39, so if we move 1 month forward, we're going to go up by 39. So this will, right here, that will be 239. If we go another month, it'll be 278. This is kind of a weird labeling of an axis, but I think you get the idea. So the graph of how much it'll cost us as per month will look something like this. So they say, how much will a membership cost by the end of the year? 12 months."
Math,"We would have to go 2, 3, all the way out to 12 months, which might be here. So then our graph is going to be out here someplace. But we could just figure it out algebraically. At the end of the year, m will be equal to 12. When m is equal to 12, how much is our membership? The price of our membership is going to be our $200 membership fee plus 39 times the number of months, times 12. What's 39 times 12? 2 times 9 is 18. 2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 70. I have a 0. 1 times 9 is 9."
Math,"1 times 3-- we want to ignore this. 1 times 3 is 3. So we have 8. 7 plus 9 is 16. 1 plus 3 is 4. So the price of our membership is $200 plus 39 times 12, which is $468. So it's equal to $668 at the end of our year. So if you went all the way out to 12, you would have to plot 668 someplace here on our line, if we just kept going out there. Let's do one more of these. Bobby and Petra are running a lemonade stand and they charge $0.45 for each glass of lemonade. In order to break even, they must make $25."
Math,"How many glasses of lemonade must they sell to break even? So let me just do it with y and x. y is equal to the amount they make. Not max-- the amount they make. Let x is equal to the number of glasses they sell. What is y as a function of x? So y is equal to-- well for every glass they sell, they get $0.45 --so it's equal to $0.45 times the number of glasses. There's not any kind of minimum fee that they need to charge or they don't say any kind of minimum cost that they have to spend to run this place."
Math,"How much in order to break even for each a glass of lemonade? They need to make $25. So in order to break even, they must make $25. So how many glasses of lemonade do they need to sell? y needs to be equal to $25. How many glasses do they need to sell? Well you just set this equation. You say 0.45x has to be equal to 25. We can divide both sides by 0.45. On the left-hand side, you're just left with an x."
Math,"You get x is equal to-- What is 25 divided by 0.45? It is equal to-- They would have to sell exactly 55.55 glasses or 56 if I round. 55.5 repeating glasses. But you can't sell half a glass or we're assuming you can't sell half a glass. So the answer to that, they must sell 56 glasses. Because you can't sell half a glass, I'm assuming. So they need to sell 56 glasses to break even. Just to graph this. Once again, we'll hang out in the first quadrant because everything is going to be positive."
Math,"Every glass they make $0.45. Let's say that they sell-- So this is the number of glasses, x. This is how much they make. Let me go by increments of 5. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. Actually I need to go by even larger increments to get to the point that we're talking about. Let me go increments of 10. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. So that's the number of glasses. When they sell 0 glasses, they make $0. That's their y-intercept. y is equal to 0. When they sell 10 glasses, they make $4.50. So this is 4.50. This is 9."
Math,"Actually let me just do it like this. Let me just mark only the multiples of 9. Let's say 9, 18, 27, 35. When they sell 10 glasses, they're going to make $4.50. 10 times 0.45. That's right there. 20 glasses, they're going to make $9.00. We can keep going there. 40 glasses, they're going to make $18. You see their slope. When you move 10, you're going to have to go up 4.50. This graph is going to look something like that. Should be a straight line."
Math,"Then if you want to see their break even, their break even has to be $25, which is right about here. Their break even is $25 right around there. Let me draw the line a little bit better than that. The line is going to look like this. If the break even is $25-- it would be right there --you see that they have to sell about 56 glasses. Obviously the way I drew this isn't the super neatly drawn graph, but hopefully it gives you the general idea.."
Math,"""After 3 weeks, the sheet is only 1.25 meters thick. ""After 3 weeks, the sheet is only 1.25 meters thick. ""Let S(t) denote the ice sheet's thickness S ""(measured in meters) as a function ""of time (measured in weeks). ""Write the function's formula."" Alright, so we have some interesting things here. They've given us some values for this function. We know when time is equal to zero. We know that S of zero, when time equals zero, that's when the sheet is two meters thick. So S of zero is equal to two."
Math,"And they also tell us that after three weeks, the sheet is only 1.25 meters thick. And when we have the function S of t, S is measured in meters, time is measured in weeks. So after zero weeks, we're two meters thick, and then they tell us, after three weeks-- So S of three. After three weeks, we're 1.25 meters thick."
Math,"Or another way to think about it, I could write t here in weeks and S in meters, and when time is zero, we're two meters thick, and when time is 1.-- Sorry, when time is three weeks, we are 1.25 meters thick. So when our change in time is equal to positive three, we increased our time by three, what's our change in thickness? Our change in thickness, the triangle here, that's the Greek letter delta, shorthand for ""change in,"" well, this was negative 0.75."
Math,"So what was the rate of change over this time? And they tell us that the rate of change is at a constant rate. So whatever it is between these two periods of time, between zero weeks and three weeks, it would be that same rate between any two periods of time, between zero week and one week, or one week and two weeks, or 1 1/2 weeks and 1.6 weeks. So what is the rate of change of thickness relative to time? Well, it's going to be change in thickness over change in time."
Math,"How much does our thickness change per time? Well, we saw right over here. Our thickness went down, set 0.75 meters in three weeks. Or we could say that this right over here is equal to, let's see. 75 divided by three is 25, so 0.75 divided by three is 0.25. We have the negative out there, negative 0.25 meters per week. So how can we take the information we have and express this as a function? It's going to be a linear function, because we see that we are changing at a constant rate."
Math,"Let's think about it a little bit. Linear functions, one way we could write it is in-- So we could write it-- If we were dealing with x and y, you might recognize y is equal to mx plus b, often written as slope-intercept form. This is when you're dealing with x as the, I guess you could say the independent variable, y as the dependent variable, and b would be where you start."
Math,"What happens when x equals zero and m is your rate of change, it's your slope? So in this case, we don't have y and x, we're going to have S and t. We have S as a function of time, and it's going to be equal to the rate of change... times time, plus where we started, plus b. Now, what is b going to be? Well, one way to think about it is, well, what's S of zero going to be? S of zero is going to be m times zero, plus b. S of zero is going to be b."
Math,"Well, we already know that this ice sheet, it starts off at two meters thick. So S of zero is equal to b, is equal to two. So b is equal to two. And what is m? Well, we've already said, that's our rate of change, that is our slope, that is how much our thickness changes with respect to time. And we already figured out that that's negative 0.25. So m is negative 0.25."
Math,"You could say that m is the slope between this point, between the point zero comma two, and the point three comma 1.25, if we were plotting these points on a t/S coordinate plane. So now we can write what the function's going to be. Maybe I'll do this in a new color just for fun. S of t, thickness as a function of time, is going to be equal to m, negative 0.25, times time, plus two. Or if you want, you could write it like this, two minus 0.25t. I actually like this form a little bit better."
Math,"In my brain, it kind of describes what's happening a little bit more. When time is equal to zero, you're starting at two meters thick, and then every week that goes by, as t increases by one, you're going to lose a quarter of a meter. You're going to lose, you have a negative value right over here, you're gonna lose 0.25 meters. And if you really want to kind of get this even in a deeper level, I encourage you to graph it, and it'll become even clearer what's going on here."
Math,"That this right over here is this right over here, is this right over here, this is the slope of the line that represents the solution set to this equation, and this two, this would be your vertical intercept. In this case, it would be your S-intercept as opposed to your y-intercept, when y is the vertical axis.."
Math,"So they're talking in terms of how much we have left to paint, not how much we have painted. Let A of t denote the area to paint, A measured in square meters as a function of time, t, measured in hours. So A of t, once again, this is how much we have to paint, not how much we have painted. Write the function's formula. So what I like to do is, let's just think about a couple points here. Let's just make it a little bit tangible for us. So, let me, I'll do this in a different color."
Math,"So let's think about what A of t is at different times. So, this is time. This is A as a function of time. And they give us one of them. They say, ""after three hours of painting, ""after three hours of painting, he had 28, ""28 square meters left to paint."" And once again, A of t is how much we have left to paint, not how much we have painted. So I'm gonna leave some space here for some other values, maybe zero, one, two. Let's write three over here. After three hours, he had 28 square meters left to paint."
Math,"We're just assuming that this is going to be in square meters, and this is in hours. Now, they tell us that he painted his room at a rate of eight square meters per hour. So let's actually back up a little bit. Let's back up."
Math,"Let's say after two hours, how much would he have had left to paint? What would A of t been? Would it have been more than 28 or would it have been less than 28? Well, he's painting eight square meters per hour, so every hour that goes by, he's painting more, but A of t isn't how much he has painted, it's how much he has left to paint. So he should have less to paint as time goes up. So as time goes up, as time increases, A of t should go down."
Math,"So at two hours, he should have more to paint than at three hours, because remember, A of t is how much he has left to paint. So how much more would he have had to paint at two hours than at three hours? Well it tells us that he has eight square meters, he paints at a rate of eight square meters per hour. So between two and three hours, he would've painted eight square meters. So at two hours, he would've had eight square meters more to paint."
Math,"So, if you add eight to this right over here, you would be at 36. So he would've had 36 square meters to paint at two hours. And what about one hour? So at one hour, he would've had eight more square meters to paint. So 36 plus eight, that is 44. And at zero hours, what would he have had to paint? So, let me do this another color, at zero hours. Well he would've had to paint eight more square meters. So 44 plus eight is 52. Let's think about whether that makes sense."
Math,"If right when he was starting, he had 52 square meters to paint. Then, an hour goes by, so your change in time is one hour, and then your change in how much he has left to paint, it goes down by eight. Change in A is equal to negative eight. That makes sense. His rate of change should be negative because the amount he has left to paint goes down as time goes forward. So this was pretty interesting. Now let's see if we can actually construct a formula, or the formula that describes this function."
Math,"Well this is happening at a constant rate. Every time t goes up by one, we see A of t goes down by eight. t goes up by one, A of t goes down by eight. They tell us that, and that's because he paints it at a rate of eight square meters per hour. So whenever you're describing something that's happening at a constant rate, that can be described by a linear function."
Math,"And a linear function will have the form A of t is equal to your rate of change times time, plus wherever you started, and m and b are just the letters that people tend to use for your rate of change, your slope, if you were graphing this, and b, where you started off, and this would be your vertical intercept, sometimes you call it your y-intercept, but in this case it would be your A-intercept, if we're thinking about the actual, it would help us find the A-intercept if we were graphing this thing."
Math,"But we actually already know both of these things. We know what our rate of change is. It is negative eight. I mean, we could say, ""well what's our slope?"" Our slope is change of A over change in t. Change in A, let me write it this way, let me do it in a different color just for fun. So our, our slope is just our change in our dependent variable over our change in our independent variable, which is equal to negative eight. They tell us that. It's equal to negative eight."
Math,"So this thing is equal to negative eight, and b is going to be equal to A of zero. A of zero, well when t is equal to zero, this term right here goes away and you're just left with b. A of zero is equal to b. And we know what A of zero is. It is equal to 52. So we know this right over here is 52. And we're done! We know that, I'll just rewrite it just for fun, A of t, the area that he has left to paint as a function of time, is equal to negative eight times time, plus 52."
Math,"And you can confirm that the units make sense, because this negative eight, and actually let's let me write it one time with the units, just 'cause it is an important thing to think about."
Math,"Area as a function of time, this is how much he has left to paint, is going to be equal to negative eight square meters per hour, so negative eight meters squared per hour, times t hours, maybe I'll write out ""hours"" so you don't think it's a variable, t hours, let me write the hours over here, t hours plus 52 square meters. Plus, let me do it right over here. Plus, I have trouble switching colors, plus 52 square meters."
Math,"And you see hours divided by hours cancels out and you'll just be left with meters squared. You'd have negative eight t square meters plus 52 square meters, and so the A of t is going to be given to you in square meters. Now there's other ways that you might have wanted to tackle this. You might've immediately said, ""Hey look, my rate of change "" is eight square meters per hour."" But you have to be very careful there."
Math,"You might've said, ""Oh my rate of change, ""maybe it's going to be positive ""eight square meters per hour."" But you have to be clear that A is not how much he's painting, it's how much he has left to paint. So his rate of change of how much he has left to paint is decreasing at eight square meters per hour."
Math,"So you might've said, ""Okay, immediately, ""my formula would look like this: ""A of t is going to to be equal to ""negative eight times t plus some b."" And then you could've used this information right over here to solve for b. You say, ""Hey, when t is equal to three, ""A is equal to 28."" You could've just used this information right over here and substituted right over here. So when t is equal to three, when this is three, A of t is 28."
Math,"And you would've gotten 28 is equal to negative eight times three, so negative 24, plus b. And then you would've added 24 to both sides. Whoops. You would've added 24 to both sides, and you would've gotten 28 plus 24 is 52. And then on the right side, you would just have b. You would get b is equal to 52, which is exactly what we got over there. I like to do it this way just to make sure that we really conceptualize, we really got what was going on.."
Math,"So far it could be a reasonable function. You give me negative 1 and I will map it to 3. Then they have if x is 2, then our value is negative 2. This is the point 2, negative 2, so that still seems consistent with being a function. If you pass me 2, I will map you or I will point you to negative 2. Seems fair enough. Let's see this next value here. This is the point 3 comma 2 right there. So once again, that says that, look, if you give me 3 into my function, into my black box, I will output a 2."
Math,"Pretty reasonable. No reason why these points can't represent a function so far. Now, what about when we input 4 into the function? Let me do this in magenta. So what happens if I input 4 into my function? So this is 4 right here. Well, according to these points, there's two points that relate to 4 that 4 can be mapped to. I could map it to the point 4 comma 5. So that says if you give me a 4, I'll give you a 5."
Math,"But it also says if you give me a 4, I could also give you a negative 1 because that's the point 4, negative 1 So this is not a function. It cannot be a function if for some input into the function you could give me two different values. And you can see that right here. And an easy test is to just see, look, for one value I have two points for this relationship. So this cannot be a function. So this is not a function! I'll put an exclamation mark.."
Math,"You can view them as the set of numbers over which that relation is defined. And then you have a set of numbers that you can view as the output of the relation, or what the numbers that can be associated with anything in domain, and we call that the range. And it's a fairly straightforward idea. So for example, let's say that the number 1 is in the domain, and that we associate the number 1 with the number 2 in the range."
Math,"So in this type of notation, you would say that the relation has 1 comma 2 in its set of ordered pairs. These are two ways of saying the same thing. Now the relation can also say, hey, maybe if I have 2, maybe that is associated with 2 as well. So 2 is also associated with the number 2. And so notice, I'm just building a bunch of associations. I've visually drawn them over here. Here I'm just doing them as ordered pairs. We could say that we have the number 3. 3 is in our domain."
Math,"Our relation is defined for number 3, and 3 is associated with, let's say, negative 7. So this is 3 and negative 7. Now this type of relation right over here, where if you give me any member of the domain, and I'm able to tell you exactly which member of the range is associated with it, this is also referred to as a function. And in a few seconds, I'll show you a relation that is not a function. Because over here, you pick any member of the domain, and the function really is just a relation."
Math,"It's really just an association, sometimes called a mapping between members of the domain and particular members of the range. So you give me any member of the domain, I'll tell you exactly which member of the range it maps to. You give me 1, I say, hey, it definitely maps it to 2. You give me 2, it definitely maps to 2 as well. You give me 3, it's definitely associated with negative 7 as well. So this relation is both a-- it's obviously a relation-- but it is also a function."
Math,"Now to show you a relation that is not a function, imagine something like this. So once again, I'll draw a domain over here, and I do this big, fuzzy cloud-looking thing to show you that I'm not showing you all of the things in the domain. I'm just picking specific examples. And let's say that this big, fuzzy cloud-looking thing is the range. And let's say in this relation-- and I'll build it the same way that we built it over here-- let's say in this relation, 1 is associated with 2."
Math,"So let's build the set of ordered pairs. So 1 is associated with 2. Let's say that 2 is associated with, let's say that 2 is associated with negative 3. So you'd have 2, negative 3 over there. And let's say on top of that, we also associate, we also associate 1 with the number 4. So we also created an association with 1 with the number 4. So we have the ordered pair 1 comma 4. Now this is a relationship."
Math,"We have, it's defined for a certain-- if this was a whole relationship, then the entire domain is just the numbers 1, 2-- actually just the numbers 1 and 2. It's definitely a relation, but this is no longer a function. And the reason why it's no longer a function is, if you tell me, OK I'm giving you 1 in the domain, what member of the range is 1 associated with? Over here, you say, well I don't know, is 1 associated with 2, or is it associated with 4? It could be either one."
Math,"So you don't have a clear association. If I give you 1 here, you're like, I don't know, do I hand you a 2 or 4? That's not what a function does. A function says, oh, if you give me a 1, I know I'm giving you a 2. If you give me 2, I know I'm giving you 2. Now with that out of the way, let's actually try to tackle the problem right over here. So let's think about its domain, and let's think about its range."
Math,"So the domain here, the possible, you can view them as x values or inputs, into this thing that could be a function, that's definitely a relation, you could have a negative 3. You could have a negative 2. You could have a 0. You could have a, well, we already listed a negative 2, so that's right over there. Or you could have a positive 3. Those are the possible values that this relation is defined for, that you could input into this relation and figure out what it outputs."
Math,"Now the range here, these are the possible outputs or the numbers that are associated with the numbers in the domain. The range includes 2, 4, 5, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, and 8. 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8. I could have drawn this with a big cloud like this, and I could have done this with a cloud like this, but here we're showing the exact numbers in the domain and the range. And now let's draw the actual associations. So negative 3 is associated with 2, or it's mapped to 2."
Math,"So negative 3 maps to 2 based on this ordered pair right over there. Then we have negative 2 is associated with 4. So negative 2 is associated with 4 based on this ordered pair right over there. Actually that first ordered pair, let me-- that first ordered pair, I don't want to get you confused. It should just be this ordered pair right over here. Negative 3 is associated with 2. Then we have negative 2-- we'll do that in a different color-- we have negative 2 is associated with 4."
Math,"Negative 2 is associated with 4. We have 0 is associated with 5. 0 is associated with 5. Or sometimes people say, it's mapped to 5. We have negative 2 is mapped to 6. Now this is interesting. Negative 2 is already mapped to something. Now this ordered pair is saying it's also mapped to 6. And then finally-- I'll do this in a color that I haven't used yet, although I've used almost all of them-- we have 3 is mapped to 8. 3 is mapped to 8."
Math,"So the question here, is this a function? And for it to be a function for any member of the domain, you have to know what it's going to map to. It can only map to one member of the range. So negative 3, if you put negative 3 as the input into the function, you know it's going to output 2. If you put negative 2 into the input of the function, all of a sudden you get confused. Do I output 4, or do I output 6? So you don't know if you output 4 or you output 6."
Math,"And because there's this confusion, this is not a function. You have a member of the domain that maps to multiple members of the range. So this right over here is not a function, not a function.."
Math,"So it should point to some other value. This is a function. It would not be a function if it says, well, it could point to y. Or it could point to z. Or maybe it could point to e or whatever else. This would not be a function. So this right over here not a function, because it's not clear if you input x what member of the range you're going to get. In order for it to be a function, it has to be very clear. For any input into the function, you have to be very clear that you're only going to get one output."
Math,"Now, with that out of the way, let's think about this function that is defined graphically. So the domains, the valid inputs, are the x values where this function is defined. So for example, it tells us if x is equal to negative 1-- if we assume that this over here is the x-axis and this is the y-axis-- it tells us, when x is equal to negative 1, we should output. Or y is going to be equal to 3."
Math,"So one way to write that mapping is you could say, if you take negative 1 and you input it into our function-- I'll put a little f box right over there-- you will get the number This is our x. And this is our y. So that seems reasonable. Negative 1 very clear that you get to 3. Let's see what happens when we go over here. If you put 2 into the function, when x is 2, y is negative 2. Once again, when x is 2 the function associates 2 for x, which is a member of the domain. It's defined for 2."
Math,"It's not defined for 1. We don't know what our function is equal to at 1. So it's not defined there. So 1 isn't part of the domain. It tells us when x is 2, then y is going to be equal to negative 2. So it maps it or associates it with negative 2. That doesn't seem too troublesome just yet. Now, let's look over here. Our function is also defined at x is equal to 3. Our function associates or maps 3 to the value y is equal to 2. That seems pretty straightforward."
Math,"And then we get to x is equal to 4, where it seems like this thing that could be a function is somewhat defined. It does try to associate 4 with things. But what's interesting here is it tries to associate 4 with two different things. All of a sudden in this thing that we think might have been a function, but it looks like it might not be, we don't know. Do we associate 4 with 5? Or do we associate it with negative 1? So this thing right over here is actually a relation."
Math,"You can have one member of the domain being related to multiple members of the range. But if you do have that, then you're not dealing with a function. So once again, because of this, this is not a function. It's not clear that when you input 4 into it, should you output 5? Or should you output negative 1? And sometimes there's something called the vertical line test that tells you whether something is a function."
Math,"When it's graphically defined like this, you literally say, OK, when x is 4, if I draw a vertical line, do I intersect the function at two places or more? It could be two or more places. And if you do, that means that there's two or more values that are related to that value in the domain. There's two or more outputs for the input 4. And if there are two or more outputs for that one input, then you're not dealing with a function. You're just dealing with a relation."
Math,A function is a special case of a relation. Or you could view it as a well-behaved relation..
Math,"So this is a function. This is a function. If we had a situation where if we input x into a box, it could be multiple possible y's, then this is not a function. So let's think about this table right over here. When x is equal to 1, we get y is equal to 1. But when x is equal to 1 again, all of a sudden, y is equal to 2. So here we have a situation where we input 1 into our little relationship box, and when we input 1 into our relationship box, we could get a 1, or we could get a 2 for y."
Math,"So this is definitely not a function. For any input into a function, it has to map to exactly one output. Here it's mapping to two outputs. So this is not a function.."
Math,"They say, hey, if you're Joelle, you're 5-6. If you're Nathan, you're 4-11. If you're Stewart, you're 5-11. That is a relationship. Now, in order for it to be a functional relationship, for every instance or every example of the independent variable, you can only have one example of the value of the function for it."
Math,"So if you say if this is a height function, in order for this to be a functional relationship, no matter whose name you put inside of the height function, you need to only be able to get one value. If there were two values associated with one person's name, it would not be a functional relationship. So if I were to ask you what is the height of Nathan? Well, you'd look at the table and say, well, Nathan's height is 4 foot 11. There are not two heights for Nathan. There is only one height."
Math,"And for any one of these people that we can input into the function, there's only one height associated with them, so it is a functional relationship. We can even see that on a graph. Let me graph that out for you. Let's see, the highest height here is 6 foot 1. So if we start off with one foot, two feet, three feet, four feet, five feet, and six feet."
Math,"And then if I were to plot the different names, the different people that I could put into our height function, we have-- I'll just put the first letters of their names. We have Joelle, we have Nathan, we have Stewart, we have LJ, and then we have Tariq right there. So lets plot them. So you have Joelle, Joelle's height is 5-6, so 5-6 is right about there. Then you have Nathan. Let me do it in a different color. Nathan's height is 4-11. We will plot to him right over there. Then you have Stewart."
Math,"Stewart's height is 5-11. He is pretty close to six feet. So Stewart's height-- I made him like six feet; let me make it a little lower-- is 5-11. Then you have LJ. LJ's height is 5-6. So you have two people with a height of 5-6, but that's OK, as long as for each person you only have one height. And then finally, Tariq is 6 foot 1. He's the tallest guy here. Tariq is right up here at 6 foot 1."
Math,"So notice, for any one of the inputs into our function, we only have one value, so this is a functional relationship. Now, you might say OK, well, isn't everything a functional relationship? If I gave you the situation, if I also wrote here-- let's say the table was like this and I also wrote that Stewart is 5 foot 3 inches. If this was our table, then we would no longer have a functional relationship because for the input of Stewart, we would have two different values."
Math,"If we were to graph this, we have Stewart here at 5-11, and then all of a sudden, we would also have Stewart at 5-3. Now, this doesn't make a lot of sense, so we would plot it right over here. So for Stewart, you would have two values, and so this wouldn't be a valid functional relationship because you wouldn't know what value to give if you were to take the height of Stewart. In order for this to be a function, there can only be one value for this."
Math,"You don't know in this situation when I add this, whether it's 5-3 or 5-11. Now, this wasn't the case, so that isn't there and so we know that the height of Stewart is 5-11 and this is a functional relationship. I think to some level, it might be confusing, because it's such a simple idea. Each of these values can only have one height associated with it. That's what makes it a function. If you had more than one height associated with it, it would not be a function.."
Math,"So one way you could think about it is you could essentially try to solve for y here. So let's do that. So I have x is equal to y squared plus 3. Subtract 3 from both sides, you get x minus 3 is equal to y squared. Now, the next step is going to be tricky, x minus 3 is equal to y squared. So y could be equal to-- and I'm just going to swap the sides. y could be equal to-- if we take the square root of both sides, it could be the positive square root of x minus 3, or it could be the negative square root."
Math,"Or y could be the negative square root of x minus 3. If you don't believe me, square both sides of this. You'll get y squared is equal to x minus 3. Square both sides of this, you're going to get y squared is equal to-- well, the negative squared is just going to be a positive 1. And you're going to get y squared is equal to x minus 3. So this is a situation here where for a given x, you could actually have 2 y-values. Let me show you. Let me attempt to sketch this graph. So let's say this is our y-axis."
Math,"I guess I could call it this relation. This is our x-axis. And this right over here, y is a positive square root of x minus 3. That's going to look like this. So if this is x is equal to 3, it's going to look like this. That's y is equal to the positive square root of x minus 3. And this over here, y is equal to the negative square root of x minus 3, is going to look something like this."
Math,"I should make it a little bit more symmetric looking, because it's going to essentially be the mirror image if you flip over the x-axis. So it's going to look something like this-- y is equal to the negative square root of x minus 3. And this right over here, this relationship cannot be-- this right over here is not a function of x. In order to be a function of x, for a given x it has to map to exactly one value for the function. But here you see it's mapping to two values of the function."
Math,"So, for example, let's say we take x is equal to 4. So x equals 4 could get us to y is equal to 1. 4 minus 3 is 1. Take the positive square root, it could be 1. Or you could have x equals 4, and y is equal to negative 1. So you can't have this situation. If you were making a table x and y as a function of x, you can't have x is equal to 4. And at one point it equals 1. And then in another interpretation of it, when x is equal to 4, you get to negative 1."
Math,"You can't have one input mapping to two outputs and still be a function. So in this case, the relation cannot-- for this relation, y cannot be represented as a mathematical function of x.."
Math,"It should spit out exactly one value of y. If it spits out multiple values of y, we don't know what f of x is going to be equal to. It could be equal to any of those possible values for y. So let's see if, for this graph, whether for a given x it spits out exactly one y. Well, the function seems to be only defined so the domain of this function is x is equal to negative 2. That's the only place where we have a definition for it."
Math,"And if we try to input negative 2 into this little black box, what do we get? Do we get exactly one thing? If we put in negative 2 here, we could get anything. The point negative 2, 9 is on this relation. Negative 2, 8 is on this relation. Negative 2, 7; negative 2, 7.5; negative 2, 3.14159-- they're all on these. So if you put a negative 2 into this relation, essentially, you actually get an infinite set of values. It could be 9. It could be 3.14. It could be 8. It could be negative 8."
Math,"You get an infinite number of results. So since it does not map to exactly one output of this function, in the following graph, y is not a function of x.."
Math,"So is y a function of x? So whenever you're asked whether something is a function of something else, you're really just saying, look, for any input x, does it map to exactly one y? So if we say y is a function of x, in order for this to be a function for any x that you input into this function, you must get exactly one y. So if you input an x you must get exactly one y value. If you got two values, then it's no longer a function. For any input, you get exactly one y."
Math,"You could have two inputs that get to the same y, but you can't have one input that results in two different outputs. You don't know what the function is valued at at that input. Now, here it looks pretty clear that for any input, you get exactly one output. Any input uniquely determines which y. It's not like if you put an x in here, you're not sure what y is going to be. You know what y is going to be. If x is 0, y is 3. If x is 1, y is 5. And so this is definitely a function of x."
Math,y is definitely a function of x..
Math,"For orders $20 or more, shipping is $7. Can the dollar amount of the order be represented as a function of shipping costs? So they're saying, can the dollar amount of the order-- so can the amount of order be represented as a function of shipping-- let me do that in that blue color costs."
Math,"So if we have the shipping costs as an input, will that map to exactly-- for a given input, will we get exactly one output for the amount of order? In order for this to be represented as a function, we have to input a shipping cost, a shipping cost where this relationship is defined. We need to input a shipping cost, put it into our relationship, and get exactly one dollar amount of the order in order for this to be a function."
Math,"If we get multiple dollar amounts of the order, then the relationship, well, it's still a relationship, but it's not going to be a function. So let's think about it. What are the possible inputs here? Well, there's only two possible shipping costs. Shipping costs are either going to be $4, or they're going to be $7. So let's think about what happens when we input $4 in as a shipping cost."
Math,"So if we input $4 into our relationship, so we input $4 into our little potential function box, so $4 into it, what is the output? What is going to be the amount of the order? Well, if the shipping cost is $4, the amount of the order just has to be anything less than $20. So it could have been $1. It could have been $1.50. It could've been $7. It literally can take on any value up to $20. So it could even be $19.99. We could do a similar thing if we input 7 into this relationship."
Math,"If 7 was-- and I could put literally an infinite number of numbers. It could be a million dollars. So if I input 7 into this relationship that we're trying to test whether it's a function, if 7 is the shipping costs, then the order we just know is over $20, $20 or more. So it could be $20. It could be $800. It could be $1 million. There's actually an infinite number of values that it could take on right over here."
Math,"So because for a valid shipping cost, for each of these valid shipping costs, I can get many, many, many potential outputs, I don't know which output it necessarily will output to. If someone tells you the shipping costs and you don't necessarily know what the order size was, this is not a function. You cannot represent the amount of order as a function of the shipping cost. So, no.."
Math,"For example, for any one-step change in x, is the change in y always going to be 3? Is it always going to be 5? If it's always going to be the same value, you're dealing with a linear function. If for each change in x--so over here x is always changing by 1, so since x is always changing by 1, the change in y's have to always be the same. If they're not, then we're dealing with a non-linear function. We can actually show that plotting out."
Math,"If the changes in x-- we're going by different values, if this went from 1 to 2 and then 2 to 4-- what you'd want to do, then, is divide the change in y by the change in x, and that should always be a constant. In fact, let me write that down. If something is linear, then the change in y over the change in x always constant. Now, in this example, the change in x's are always 1, right? We go from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5. So in this example, the change in x is always going to be 1."
Math,"So in order for this function to be linear, our change in y needs to be constant because we're just going to take that and divide it by 1. So let's see if our change in y is constant. When we go from 11 to 14, we go up by 3. When we go from 14 to 19, we go up by 5, so I already see that it is not constant. We didn't go up by 3 this time, we went up by 5. And here, we go up by 7. And here, we're going up by 9."
Math,"So we're actually going up by increasing amounts, so we're definitely dealing with a non-linear function. And we can see that if we graph it out. So let me draw-- I'll do a rough graph here. So let me make that my vertical axis, my y-axis. And we go all the way up to 35. So I'll just do 10, 20, 30. Actually, I can it do a little bit more granularly than that. I could do 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and then 35. And then our values go 1 through 5. I'll do it on this axis right here."
Math,"They're not obviously the exact same scale, so I'll do 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. So let's plot these points. So the first point is 1, 11, when x is 1, y is 11. This is our x-axis. When x is 1, y is 11, that's right about there. When x is 2, y is 14, that's right about there. When x is 3, y is 19, right about there. When x is 4, y is 26, right about there. And then finally, when x is 5, y is 35, right up there. So you can immediately see that this is not tracing out a line."
Math,"If this was a linear function, then all the points would be on a line that looks something like that. That's why it's called a linear function. In this case, it's not, it's non-linear. The rate of increase as x changes is going up.."
Math,"So let's see what happened to what our change in x was. So our change in x-- and I could even write it over here, our change in x. So going from negative 7 to negative 3, we had an increase in 4 in x. And what was our change in y? And this triangle, that's just the Greek letter delta. It's shorthand for ""change in."" Well, our change in y when x increased by 4, our y-value went from 4 to 3. So our change in y is negative 1."
Math,"Now, in order for this to be a linear equation, the ratio between our change in y and our change in x has to be constant. So our change in y over change in x for any two points in this equation or any two points in the table has to be the same constant. When x changed by 4, y changed by negative 1. Or when y changed by negative 1, x changed by 4. So we have to have a constant change in y with respect to x of negative 1/4. Let's see if this is true."
Math,"So the next two points, when I go from negative 3 to 1, once again I'm increasing x by 4. And once again, I'm decreasing y by negative 1. So we have that same ratio. Now, let's look at this last point. When we go from 1 to 7 in the x-direction, we are increasing by 6. And when we go from 2 to 1, we are still decreasing by 1. So now this ratio, going from this third point to this fourth point, is negative 1/6. So it is not."
Math,"So just for this last point right over here, for this last point, our change in y over change in x, or I should say, really, between these last two points right over here, our change in y over change in x-- let me clear this up. Let me make it clear. So just between these last-- in magenta. Just between these last two points over here, our change in y is negative 1, and our change in x is 6. So we have a different rate of change of y with respect to x."
Math,"Because we had a different rate of change of y with respect to x, or ratio between our change in y and change in x, this is not a linear equation. No, not a linear equation.."
Math,"Can this relationship be represented using a linear equation? So let's see if it can. Let's define one variable for the amount of time, the number of minutes they spend playing Super Bologna Man. Let's define that as, well let's just say that's x. So x is equal to time playing Bologna Man. I'll write Bologna right here. And let's define y as y is equal to the number of minutes they spend playing You Have to Cut the Wire. So it's time playing, I'll just call it Wire for short."
Math,"So if we have the minutes they play time playing Bologna and the time playing Cut Your Wire. If I were to add those two together, so if I say x plus y. I'll write that plus in a neutral color, x plus y. What does this need to be equal to? The time I play Bologna Man plus the time I play Have to Cut the Wire. Well if I add them together, they want to spend exactly 45 minutes playing both games. So this is going to be equal to 45 minutes."
Math,"Now we have set up an equation that relates the time playing Bologna Man and the time playing You Have to Cut the Wire. But now we have to think about is this a linear relationship? So one way to think about it is the real giveaway for a linear relationship is if you can write it in the traditional form of a line. So if you can write it in the y is equal to mx plus b form, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. So let's see if we can do that."
Math,"Well if we want to do that here, we could just subtract x from both sides. You subtract x from both sides, you get-- so let's subtract an x over here, let's subtract an x over here. So negative x plus this and then subtract an x there. Well, that's going to cancel, and you're going to be left with-- and I'm going try to write it in this form right over here-- y is equal to 45. Let me do that in the same color, just to make it not be confusing."
Math,"y is equal to, and I'll write the negative x first because we have the x term right over here first. So y is equal to negative x plus 45. All I did is I switched these two terms around. But you see here, it has that form. And you might say wait what is m here? I see that b is 45. Well if I write negative x, that's the same thing as writing negative 1x. So this is definitely a line. I was able to write it in this form right over here."
Math,"So can this relationship be represented using a linear equation? Absolutely, absolutely yes.."
Math,"When x is 2, y is equal to 3. So let's see what happened. When x increased by 1, what did y do? Well looks like y increased by 3 and 1/2 is the same thing as 1 and 1/2. So to go from 1 and 1/2 to 3, it increased by 1 and 1/2, or you could say it increased by 3/2. You could say that 3 is the same thing as 6/2, 6/2 minus 3/2 is another 3/2. All right. Now when we go from 2 to 3, we're increasing by 1 again in x. And what are we doing in y? So we're going from 3, which is the same thing as 6/2 to 9/2."
Math,"So once again, we are increasing by 3/2. So in order for this to be a linear equation or a linear relationship, every time we increase by 1 in the x direction, we need to increase by 3/2. If we increase by 2, we need to increase by 2 times 3/2. So what are we doing over here on this fourth term on the table? Well we're increasing. We're going from 3 to 8 so we are increasing by 5. So if we're increasing x by 5, then we need to increase y by 5 times 3/2 or 15 over 2."
Math,"So that's the amount that we have to increase y by. If we started at 9/2 and we're going to increase by 15/2, so it's going to be 9/2 plus 15/2, this is how much we increment by. Remember, we increment 3/2 every time x moves 1. This time, x moved 5. So we're incrementing by 15/2, or you could say we're incrementing by 3/2 five times. But this is going to be equal to 9 plus 15 is 24 over 2 which is equal to 12. And so in the box, we could write 12, and we are done.."
Math,"Complete the sentences based on the graph of the function. So this axis is our y-axis, the vertical axis. Horizontal axis is x-axis. Initially, as x increases-- so let's think about it. Initially, so when we start from x equals 0 and x is increasing, what's happening to y? Well, y is decreasing. So y decreases. So as x increases initially, y decreases. The slope of the graph is equal to blank for all x between x equals 0 and x equals 3."
Math,"So x equals 0 and x equals 3, what's the slope? Well, every time we move 1 in the x direction, we move down in the y direction. We go negative 1 in the y direction. Move up 1 in the x direction, we go negative 1 in the y direction. So our change in y over our change in x-- our change in y is negative 1 whenever our change in x is 1. So our change in y over our change in x, which is the definition of slope, is negative 1/1. So it's negative 1. And we see that. Every time x increases by 1, y decreases by 1."
Math,"Starting at x equals 3, y blank as x increases. So starting at x equals 3, y increases as x increases. As x increases, y is increasing. So y increases as x increases. The slope of the graph is equal to blank for x between 3 and 5. So when x increases by 1, y is increasing by 3. So change in y is 3, change in x is 1. Slope is change in y over change in x, which is 3/1. So the slope here is 3. Every time x increases by 1, y increases by 3."
Math,"For x between x equals 0 and x equals 4, y-- let's see, we can pick less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, or equal. So for x equals 0 and x equals 4, y is less than or equal to 0. So let's do less than or equal to 0. And then they say, for x between x equals 4 and x equals 8-- well, then y is greater than or equal to 0. So let's make sure that we didn't make any careless mistakes here. Let's check our answer. We got it right.."
Math,"You can't swim across it. It's a very rough river. So you have to cross this bridge. And so as you approach the bridge, this troll shows up. That's the troll. And he says, well, I'm a reasonable troll. You just have to pay $5. And when you look a little bit more carefully, you see that there actually was a sign there that says $5 toll to cross the bridge. Now, unfortunately for you, you do not have any money in your pocket. And so the troll says, well, you can't cross."
Math,"But you say, I need to really, really get to that castle. And so the troll says, well, I'll take some pity on you. Instead of paying the $5, I will give you a riddle. And the riddle is this. And now, I'm speaking as the troll. I am a rich troll because I get to charge from everyone who crosses the bridge. And actually, I only accept $5 or $10 bills. It's a bit of a riddle why they accept American currency in this fantasy land. But let's just take that as a given for now. So I only take $5 or $10 bills."
Math,"I'm being the troll. Obviously, if you give me a $10, I'll give you $5 back. And I know, because I count my money on a daily basis. I like to save my money as the troll. I know that I have a total of 900 bills. So let me write that down. I have a total of 900 bills, a total of 900 $5 and $10 bills. And he says, because I'm very sympathetic, I'll give you another piece of information."
Math,"He says, if you were to add up the value of all of my money, which is all in $5 and $10 bills that I have, I, speaking as the troll about dollars bills, is $5,500. This is a rich troll. And so the riddle is-- exactly, exactly. And if you give the wrong answer and if you're not able to solve it in 10 minutes, he's just going to push you into the river or do something horrible to you."
Math,"He says, exactly how many 5's and 10's do I, the troll, have? So the first thing I'm going to have you think about is, is this even a solvable problem? Because if it's not a solvable problem, you should probably run as fast as you can in the other direction. So now, I will tell you, yes, it is a solvable problem. And let's start thinking about it a little bit algebraically. And to do that, let's just set some variables. And I will set the variables to be what we're really trying to solve for."
Math,"We're trying to solve for the number of $5 bills we have and the number of $10 bills that we have. So let's just define some variables. I'll say f for 5. Let's let f equal the number of $5 bills that we have. And I'll use the same idea. Let's let t is equal to the number $10 bills that we have. Now, given this information, and now I'm not sure if I'm speaking as-- well, let's say I'm still speaking as the troll. I'm a very sympathetic troll, and I'm going to give you hints."
Math,"Given this information and setting these variables in this way, can I represent the clues in the riddle mathematically? So let's focus on the first clue. Can I represent this clue that the total of 900 $5 and $10 bills, or can I represent that mathematically, that I have a total of 900 $5 and $10 bills? Well, what's going to be our total of bills? It's going to be the number of 5's that we have, which is f. The number of 5's that we have is f. And then the number of 10s that we have is t."
Math,"The total number of 5's plus the total number of 10s, that's our total number of bills. So that's going to be equal to 900. So this statement, this first clue in our riddle, can be written mathematically like this if we defined the variables like that. And I just said f for 5, because f for 5 in t for 10. Now, let's look at the second clue."
Math,"Can we represent this one mathematically given these variable definitions that we created? Well, let's think separately about the value of the $5 bills and the value of the $10 bills. What's the value of all of the $5 bills? Well, each $5 bill is worth $5. So it's going to be 5 times the number of $5 bills that we have. So if I have one $5 bill, it will be $5. If I have 100 $5 bills, then it's going to be $500. How ever many $5 bills, I just multiply it by 5. That's the value of the $5 bills."
Math,"Let me write that down. Value of the $5 bills. Now, same logic. What's the value of the $10 bills? Well, the value of the $10 bills is just going to be 10 times however many bills I have-- value of the $10 bills. So what's going to be the total value of my bills? Well, it's going to be the value of the $5 bills plus the value of the $10 bills? And he tells me what that total value is. It's $5,500. So if I add these two things, they're going to add up to be $5,500."
Math,"So this second statement we can represent mathematically with this second equation right over here. And what we essentially have right over here, we have two equations. Each of them have two unknowns. And just using one of these equations, we can't really figure out what f and t are. You can pick a bunch of different combinations that add up to 900 here. You could pick a bunch of different combinations, where if you work out all the math, you get $5,500."
Math,"So independently, these equations, you don't know what f and t are. But what we will see over the next several videos is that if you use both of this information, if you say that there's an f and a t that has to satisfy both of these equations, then you can find a solution. And this is called a system of equations. Let me write that down-- system of equations.."
Math,"So we are under pressure. And at least we made some headway in the last video. We were able to represent his clues mathematically as a system of equations. What I want to do in this video is think about whether we can solve for this system of equations. And you'll see that there are many ways of solving a system of equations. But this time I want to do it visually. Because at least in my mind, it helps really get the intuition of what these things are saying. So let's draw some axes over here."
Math,"Let's draw an f-axis. That's the number of fives that I have. And let's draw a t-axis. That is the number of tens I have. And let's say that this right over here is 500 tens. That is 1,000 tens. And let's say this is-- oh, sorry, that's 500 fives. That's 1,000 fives. This is 500 tens, And this is 1,000 tens. So let's think about all of the combinations of f's and t's that satisfy this first equation. If we have no tens, then we're going to have 900 fives. So that looks like it's right about there."
Math,"So that's the point 0 tens, 900 fives. But what if went the other way? If we have no fives, we're going to have 900 tens. So that's going to be the point 900 tens, 0 fives. So all the combinations of f's and t's that satisfy this are going to be on this line right over there. And I'll just draw a dotted line just because it's easier for me to draw it straight. So that represents all the f's and t's that satisfy the first constraint."
Math,"Obviously, there's a bunch of them, so we don't know which is the one that is actually what the troll has. But lucky for us, we have a second constraint-- this one right over here. So let's do the same thing. In this constraint, what happens if we have no tens? If tens are 0, then we have 5f is equal to 5,500. Let me do a little table here, because this is a little bit more involved. So for the second equation, tens and fives. If I have no tens, I have 5f is equal to 5,500, f will be 1,100."
Math,"I must have 1,100 fives. If I have no fives, then this is 0, and I have 10t is equal to 5,500, that means I have 550 tens. So let's plot both at those point. t equals 0, f is 11. That's right about there. So that is 0. 1,100 is on the line that represents this equation. And that when f is 0, t is 550. So let's see, this is about-- this would be 6, 7, 8, 9, so 550 is going to be right over here. So that is the point 550 comma 0. And all of these points-- let me try to draw a straight line again."
Math,"I could do a better job than that. So all of these points are the points-- let me try one more time. We want to get this right. We don't want to get pushed into the water by the troll. So there you go. That looks pretty good. So every point on this blue line represents an ft combination that satisfies the second constraint. So what is an f and t, or number of fives and number of tens that satisfy both constraints? Well, it would be a point that is sitting on both of the lines."
Math,"And what is a point that is sitting on both of the lines? Well, that's where they intersect. This point right over here is clearly on the blue line and is clearly on the yellow line. And what we can do is, if we drew this graph really, really precisely, we could see how many fives that is and how many tens that is. And if you look at it, if you look at very precisely, and actually I encourage you to graph it very precisely and come up with how many fives and how many tens that is."
Math,"Well, when we do it right over here, I'm going to eyeball it. If we look at it right over here, it looks like we have about 700 fives, and it looks like we have about 200 tens. And this is based on my really rough graph. But let's see if that worked. 700 plus 200 is equal to 900. And if I have 700 fives-- let me write this down. 5 times 700 is going to be the value of the fives, which is $3,500. And then 10 plus 10 times 200, which is $2,000, $2,000 is the value of the 10s."
Math,"And if you add up the two values, you indeed get to $ 5,500 So this looks right. And so we can tell the troll-- Troll! I know! I know how many $5 and $10 bills you. You have 700 $5 bills, and you have 200 $10 bills. The troll is impressed, and he lets you cross the bridge to be the hero or heroine of this fantasy adventure.."
Math,"Or another way of thinking about it, x equals 7, and y-- sorry, x is equal to negative 1. This is the x coordinate. X equals negative 1, and y is equal to 7, need to satisfy both of these equations in order for it to be a Solution. So let's try it out. Let's try it out with the first equation. So we have x plus 2y is equal to 13."
Math,"So if we're thinking about that, we're testing to see if when x is equal to negative 1, and y is equal to 7, will x plus 2y equals 13? So we have negative 1 plus 2 times 7-- y should be 7-- this needs to be equal to 13. And I'll put a question mark there because we don't know whether it does. So this is the same thing as negative 1 plus 2 times 7 plus 14. That does, indeed, equal 13. Negative 1 plus 14, this is 13. So 13 does definitely equal 13."
Math,"So this point it does, at least, satisfy this first equation. This point does sit on the graph of this first equation, or on the line of this first equation. Now let's look at the second equation. I'll do that one in blue. We have 3 times negative 1 minus y, so minus 7, needs to be equal to negative 11. I'll put a question mark here because we don't know whether it's true or not. So let's see, we have 3 times negative 1 is negative 3."
Math,"And then we have minus 7 needs to be equal to negative 11-- I put the question mark there. Negative 3 minus 7, that's negative 10. So we get negative 10 equaling negative 11. No, negative 10 does not equal a negative 11. So x equaling negative 1, and y equaling 7 does not satisfy the second equation. So it does not sit on its graph. So this over here is not a solution for the system. So the answer is no. It satisfies the first equation, but it doesn't satisfy the second."
Math,"In order to be a solution for the system, it has to satisfy both equations.."
Math,"So we draw our axis, our axes. That's my y-axis. This is my x-axis. And this is already in mx plus b form, or slope-intercept form. The y-intercept here is y is equal to 3, and the slope here is 1. So this line is going to look like this. We intersect at 0 comma 3-- 1, 2, 3. At 0 comma 3. And we have a slope of 1, so every 1 we go to the right, we go up 1. So the line will look something like that. It's a good enough approximation. So the line will look like this."
Math,"And remember, when I'm drawing a line, every point on this line is a solution to this equation. Or it represents a pair of x and y that satisfy this equation. So maybe when you take x is equal to 5, you go to the line, and you're going to see, gee, when x is equal to 5 on that line, y is equal to 8 is a solution. And it's going to sit on the line. So this represents the solution set to this equation, all of the coordinates that satisfy y is equal to x plus 3. Now let's say we have another equation."
Math,"Let's say we have an equation y is equal to negative x plus 3. And we want to graph all of the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation. Well, we can do the same thing. This has a y-intercept also at 3, right there. But its slope is negative 1. So it's going to look something like this. Every time you move to the right 1, you're going to move down 1. Or if you move to the right a bunch, you're going to move down that same bunch. So that's what this equation will look like."
Math,"Every point on this line represents a x and y pair that will satisfy this equation. Now, what if I were to ask you, is there an x and y pair that satisfies both of these equations? Is there a point or coordinate that satisfies both equations? Well, think about it. Everything that satisfies this first equation is on this green line right here, and everything that satisfies this purple equation is on the purple line right there."
Math,"So what satisfies both? Well, if there's a point that's on both lines, or essentially, a point of intersection of the lines. So in this situation, this point is on both lines. And that's actually the y-intercept. So the point 0, 3 is on both of these lines. So that coordinate pair, or that x, y pair, must satisfy both equations. And you can try it out. When x is 0 here, 0 plus 3 is equal to 3. When x is 0 here, 0 plus 3 is equal to 3. It satisfies both of these equations."
Math,"So what we just did, in a graphical way, is solve a system of equations. Let me write that down. And all that means is we have several equations. Each of them constrain our x's and y's. So in this case, the first one is y is equal to x plus 3, and then the second one is y is equal to negative x plus 3. This constrained it to a line in the xy plane, this constrained our solution set to another line in the xy plane."
Math,"And if we want to know the x's and y's that satisfy both of these, it's going to be the intersection of those lines. So one way to solve these systems of equations is to graph both lines, both equations, and then look at their intersection. And that will be the solution to both of these equations. In the next few videos, we're going to see other ways to solve it, that are maybe more mathematical and less graphical. But I really want you to understand the graphical nature of solving systems of equations."
Math,"Let's do another one. Let's say we have y is equal to 3x minus 6. That's one of our equations. And let's say the other equation is y is equal to negative x plus 6. And just like the last video, let's graph both of these. I'll try to do it as precisely as I can. There you go. Let me draw some. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I should have just copied and pasted some graph paper here, but I think this'll do the job."
Math,"So let's graph this purple equation here. Y-intercept is negative 6, so we have-- let me do another [? slash-- ?] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So that's y is equal to negative 6. And then the slope is 3. So every time you move 1, you go up 3. You moved to the right 1, your run is 1, your rise is 1, 2, 3. That's 3, right? 1, 2, 3. So the equation, the line will look like this. And it looks like I intersect at the point 2 comma 0, which is right. 3 times 2 is 6, minus 6 is 0."
Math,"So our line will look something like that right there. That's that line there. What about this line? Our y-intercept is plus 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And our slope is negative 1. So every time we go 1 to the right, we go down 1. And so this will intersect at-- well, when y is equal to 0, x is equal to 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So right over there. So this line will look like that. The graph, I want to get it as exact as possible. And so we're going to ask ourselves the same question."
Math,"What is an x, y pair that satisfies both of these equations? Well, you look at it here, it's going to be this point. This point lies on both lines. And let's see if we can figure out what that point is. Just eyeballing the graph here, it looks like we're at 1, 2, 3 comma 1, 2, 3. It looks like this is the same point right there, that this is the point 3 comma 3. I'm doing it just on inspecting my hand-drawn graphs, so maybe it's not the exact-- let's check this answer."
Math,"Let's see if x is equal to 3, y equals 3 definitely satisfies both these equations. So if we check it into the first equation, you get 3 is equal to 3 times 3, minus 6. This is 9 minus 6, which is indeed 3. So 3 comma 3 satisfies the top equation. And let's see if it satisfies the bottom equation. You get 3 is equal to negative 3 plus 6, and negative 3 plus 6 is indeed 3."
Math,"So even with our hand-drawn graph, we were able to inspect it and see that, yes, we were able to come up with the point 3 comma 3, and that does satisfy both of these equations. So we were able to solve this system of equations. When we say system of equations, we just mean many equations that have many unknowns. They don't have to be, but they tend to have more than one unknown."
Math,"And you use each equation as a constraint on your variables, and you try to find the intersection of the equations to find a solution to all of them. In the next few videos, we'll see more algebraic ways of solving these than drawing their two graphs and trying to find their intersection points.."
Math,"And they give us two equations. This first one in blue, y is equal to 7/5x minus 5, and then this one in green, y is equal to 3/5x minus 1. So let's graph each of these, and we'll do it in the corresponding color. So first let's graph this first equation. So the first thing I see is its y-intercept is negative 5. Or another way to think about it, when x is equal to 0, y is going to be negative 5. So let's try this out. So when x is equal to 0, y is going to be equal to negative 5. So that makes sense."
Math,"And then we see its slope is 7/5. This was conveniently placed in slope-intercept form for us. So it's rise over run. So for every time it moves 5 to the right it's, going to move seven up. So if it moves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to the right, it's going to move 7 up. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So it'll get right over there. Another way you could have done it is you could have just tested out some values. You could have said, oh, when x is equal to 0, y is equal to negative 5."
Math,"When x is equal to 5, 7/5 times 5 is 7 minus 5 is 2. So I think we've properly graphed this top one. Let's try this bottom one right over here. So we have when x is equal to 0, y is equal to negative 1. So when x is equal to 0, y is equal to negative 1. And the slope is 3/5. So if we move over 5 to the right, we will move up 3. So we will go right over there, and it looks like they intersect right at that point, right at the point x is equal to 5, y is equal to 2."
Math,"So we'll type in x is equal to 5, y is equal to 2. And you could even verify by substituting those values into both equations, to show that it does satisfy both constraints. So let's check our answer. And it worked.."
Math,"And when they say to do it by graphing, we're essentially going to graph this first equation. Remember, the graph is really just depicting all of the x's and y's that satisfy this first equation, and then we graph the second equation that's depicting all of the x's and y's that satisfy that one. So if we were looking for an x and a y that satisfies both, that point needs to be on both equations or it has to be on both graphs. So it'll be the intersection of the two graphs."
Math,"So let's try to see if we can do that. So let's focus on this first equation, and I want to graph it. So I have 5x plus 3y is equal to 7. There's a couple of ways we could graph this. We could put this in slope-intercept form, or we could just pick some points here. You just really need two points to graph a line. So let me just set some points over here. Let's say x and y."
Math,"When x is equal to 0, what does y need to be equal to? So when x is equal to 0, we have-- let me do it over here-- we have 5 times 0, plus 3 times y, is equal to 7. That's just 0 over there. So you have 3y is equal to 7. Divide both sides by 3, you get y is equal to 7/3, which is the same thing as 2 and 1/3 if we want to write it as a mixed number. Now let's set y equal to 0. So if we set y as equal to 0, we get 5x, plus 3 times 0, is equal to 7. Or in this part right over here, it just becomes 0."
Math,"So we have 5x is equal to 7. Divide both sides by 5, and we get x equals 7/5, which is the same thing as 1 and 2/5. So let's graph both of these points, and then we should be able to graph this line, or at least a pretty good approximation of that line. So we have the point, 0, 2 and 1/3. So that's that point right over there. So I'll call it 0, 7/3 right over there, and then we have the point, 7/5, 0, or 1 and 2/5, 0. So 1 and 2/5. 2/5 is a little less than a half. So 1 and 2/5, 0."
Math,"So our line is going to look something like this. I just have to connect the dots. It's always hard to draw the straight line. I'll draw it as a dotted line. So it would look something like this. Normally, when you have to solve a system of equations by graphing, they normally give you a little bit cleaner numbers, but we'll try our best and see if we can see where these two lines intersect. So now, let's worry about the second one right over there. So we have 3x minus 2y is equal to 8."
Math,"So I'll do the same thing. So 3x minus 2y is equal to 8. We'll just look at the x- and the y-intercepts. So first, the y-intercept. When x is equal to 0, this whole thing boils down to 3 times 0 minus 2y is equal to 8. That's just 0. So you have negative 2y is equal to 8. Divide both sides by negative 2, we get y is equal to negative 4. So the y-intercept is 0, negative 4. Right over here, and we mark it 0, negative 4. And then, let's set y equal to 0."
Math,"So when y is equal to 0, this term right over here just becomes 0. So we get 3x minus 2 times 0, so that's just 0. So 3x is equal to 8. Divide both sides by 3, you get x is equal to 8/3. And 8/3 is the same thing as 2 and 2/3. So it puts it right about there. That's the point, 0, 8/3. Now let me try my best to graph it. Connect these two dots. So let me do my very best. I drew a dotted line there. It goes something like that. And just eyeballing it, it looks like these two lines intersect right over there."
Math,"I'm hoping that this will give us a clean answer. And this is the point 2, negative 1. So that is the point, 2, negative 1. Right? The x value here is 2. y value is negative 1. Now, that's what we got just by eyeballing it, and clearly these are hand-drawn graphs. Not very precise. Let's verify or let's see if 2, negative 1 does satisfy both of these equations, if it's an x and y value that satisfies both and lies on both the graphs."
Math,"So if you put 2, negative 1 in this first equation, you get 5 times 2, plus 3 times negative 1, and we're going to see if that is equal to 7. So this is 10 plus negative 3. So that's the same thing as 10 minus 3. Does that equal 7? And yeah, it does. 10 minus 3 is equal to 7. So 2, negative 1 is definitely on that graph or definitely satisfies that equation. And then, let's do it with the other one. So if we do 2, negative 1, you have 3 times 2, minus 2 times negative 1."
Math,"And we're testing to see if that is equal to 8. So 3 times 2. 3 times 2 is 6. And then 2 times negative 1 is negative 2. But then, we're subtracting that, so it's 6 plus 2. 6 plus 2 is equal to 8. And it definitely does equal 8. So we have the coordinate or we have the point, 2, negative 1 satisfying both equations. So we've solved the system of linear equations by graphing.."
Math,"How much did they each earn? So let's define some variables here. Let's let A equal Abby's earnings. And let's let B equal Ben's earnings. Then they tell us how these earnings relate. They first tell us that together they earned $50. So that statement can be converted mathematically into-- well, together, that means the sum of the two earnings. So A plus B needs to be equal to $50. Abby's plus Ben's earnings is $50. And then they tell us Abby earned $10 more than Ben."
Math,"So we could translate that into Abby's earnings is equal to Ben's earnings plus 10. Abby earned $10 more than Ben. So we have a system of two equations and actually with two unknowns. And then they say, how much did each earn? So to do that, and they want us to solve this graphically. There's multiple ways to solve it, but we'll do what they ask us to do. Let me draw some axes over here. And I'll be in the first quadrant since we're dealing with earnings, so neither of their earnings can be negative."
Math,"And let me just define the vertical axis as Abby's axis or the Abby's earnings axis. And let me define the horizontal axis as Ben's axis or Ben's earnings axis. And let me just graph each of these equations. And to do that, I'm going to take this first equation, and I'm going to put it in the equivalent of slope-intercept form. It might look a little unfamiliar to you, but it really is slope-intercept form. Let me rewrite it first. So we have A plus B is equal to 50. We can subtract B from both sides."
Math,"So let's subtract B from both sides. And then we get A is equal to negative B plus 50. So if you think about it this way, when B is equal to 0, A is going to be 50. So we know our A intercept, we could call it. We normally would call that a y-intercept, but now this is the A axis. So this right here, let me call this 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. So if Ben made $0, then Abby would have to make $50 based on that first constraint. So we know that that's a point on the line right over there."
Math,"And we also know that the slope is negative 1, that B is the independent variable, the way I've written it over here, and this coefficient is negative 1. Or another way to think about it is if A is 0, then B is going to be 50. If Abby made no money, then Ben would have to make $50. And that falls purely out of this equation right here. If Abby made nothing, then Ben would have to make $50, so 10, 20, 30, 40, 50."
Math,"So those are those two situations and every point in between will satisfy this first constraint. So let me connect the dots. So it would look something like that. That's due to this first constraint, due to the fact that together they earned $50. Now, let's think about the second one. Abby earned $10 more than Ben. So that's this equation right here. And it's really already in our slope-intercept form. If Ben made $0, then Abby would make $10. So that's our A intercept. So it's right over there."
Math,"We could keep doing that. Our slope is going to be 1 here. If Ben makes $10, then Abby's going to make $20. If Ben makes $20, Abby's going to make $30. We could keep going, but I think this gives us the general direction. It already hints at a point of intersection. So just eyeballing it, so we've graphed to the two constraints, together they earned $50. That's the magenta constraint right over here. Abby earned $10 more than Ben. That's this green constraint right over here."
Math,"And it looks like we have a point of intersection. And it looks like we have a point of intersection at Ben earning $20. Let me label this as 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. So this is Ben earning $20 and Abby earning-- this is 10, 20, and 30. And Abby earning $30. So just eyeballing it off of this, it looks like A is 30 and B is 20. And let's go verify, make sure that these levels of earnings for Abby and Ben actually satisfy both constraints. So the first constraint is that Abby plus Ben have to make $50."
Math,"Well, $30 plus $20 is $50. So it meets our first constraint. The second constraint is that Abby earned $10 more than Ben, that Abby is equal to Ben plus 10. Well, once again, over here, Abby is making $10 more than Ben. So it meets our second constraint. And we only have two of them. So it meets both of them. So that's our solution. Abby earned $30. Ben earned $20.."
Math,"It says: ""Graph the system of equations ""and find its solution."" So we're gonna try to find it visually. So let's graph this first one. To graph this line, I have the little graphing tool here. Notice if I can figure out two points, I can move those points around and it's going to define our line for us. I'm gonna pick two X values and figure out the corresponding Y values and then graph the line. So let's see how I could do this."
Math,"So let's see; an easy one is what happens when X is equal to zero? Well if X is equal to zero, everything I just shaded goes away and we're left with -3y is equal to nine. So -3y equals nine. Y would be negative three. So when X is equal to zero, Y would be negative three. So let me graph that. When X is equal to zero, X is zero, Y is negative three."
Math,"Now another easy point actually instead of trying another X value, let's think about when Y is equal to zero 'cause these equations are in a standard form so it's easy to just test. Well what are the X and Y intercepts? So when Y is equal to zero, this term goes away, and you have negative X is equal to nine, or X would be equal to negative nine. So when Y is zero, X is negative nine. So when Y is zero, X is negative nine, or when X is negative nine, Y is zero. So I've just plotted this first equation."
Math,"So now let's do the second one. We'll do the same thing. What happens when X is equal to zero? When X is equal to zero, so this is going to be our Y intercept now. When X is equal to zero, -6y is equal to negative six. Well Y would have to be equal to one. So when X is zero, Y is equal to one. So when X is zero, Y is equal to one. Get one more point here. When Y is zero, when this term is zero, Y being zero would make this entire term zero, then 6x is equal to negative six or X is equal to negative one."
Math,"So when Y is zero, X is negative one or when X is negative one, Y is zero. When X is negative one, Y is zero. And so just like that, I've plotted the two lines. And the solution to the system are the X and Y values that satisfy both equations; and if they satisfy both equations, that means they sit on both lines. And so in order to be on both lines, they're going to be at the point of intersection."
Math,"And I see this point of intersection right over here, it looks pretty clear that this is the point X is equal to negative three and Y is equal to negative two. So it's the point negative three comma negative two. So let me write that down. Negative three comma negative two. And then I could check my answer; got it right. Let's do another. Let's do another one of these. Maybe of a different type. So over here it says: ""A system of two linear equations ""is graphed below."
Math,"""Approximate the solution of the system."" Alright so here I just have to just look at this carefully and think about where this point is. So let's think about first its X value. So its X value, it's about right there in terms of its X value. It looks like, so this is negative one. This is negative two, so negative 1.5 is gonna be right over here. It's a little bit to the left of negative 1.5, so it's even more negative, I would say negative 1.6. And I'm approximating it, negative 1.6."
Math,"Hopefully it has a little leeway in how it checks the answer. What about the Y value? So if I look at the Y value here, it looks like it's a little less than one and a half. One and a half would be halfway between one and two. It looks like it's a little less than halfway between one and two, so I'd give it 1.4, positive 1.4. And let's check the answer, see how we're doing. Yep, we got it right. Let's actually just do one more for good measure. So this is another system."
Math,"They've just written the equations in more of our slope intercept form. So let's see, Y is equal to negative seven, X plus three. When X is equal to zero, we have our Y intercept. Y is equal to three. So when X is equal to zero, Y is equal to three. And then we see that our slope is negative seven. When you increase X by one, you decrease Y by seven. So when you increase X by one, you decrease Y by one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven."
Math,"When X goes from zero to one, Y went from three to negative four, it went down by seven, so that's that first one. Now the second one: our Y intercept. When X is equal to zero, Y is negative three, so let me graph that. When X is zero, Y is equal to negative three. And then its slope is negative one. When X increases by one, Y decreases by one. So the slope here is negative one. So when X increases by one, Y decreases by one. And there you have it. You have your point of intersection."
Math,"You have the X-Y pair that satisfies both equations. That is the point of intersection. It's gonna sit on both lines which is why it's the point of intersection. And that's the point X equals one, Y is equal to negative four. So you have X equals one and Y is equal to negative four. And I can check my answer and we got it right.."
Math,"And the second equation here is x is equal to y minus 4. So what we want to do, when they say substitution, what we want to do is substitute one of the variables with an expression so that we have an equation and only one variable. And then we can solve for it. Let me show you what I'm talking about. So let me rewrite this first equation. 2y is equal to x plus 7. And we have the second equation over here, that x is equal to y minus 4."
Math,"So if we're looking for an x and a y that satisfies both constraints, well we could say, well look, at the x and y have to satisfy both constraints, both of these constraints have to be true. So x must be equal to y minus 4. So anywhere in this top equation where we see an x, anywhere we see an x, we say well look, that x by the second constraint has to be equal to y minus 4. So everywhere we see an x, we can substitute it with a y minus 4. So let's do that."
Math,"So if we substitute y minus 4 for x in this top equation, the top equation becomes 2y is equal to instead of an x, the second constraint tells us that x needs to be equal to y minus 4. So instead of an x, we'll write a y minus 4, and then we have a plus 7. All I did here is I substituted y minus 4 for x. The second constraint tells us that we need to do it. y minus 4 needs to be equal to x or x needs to be equal to y minus 4. The value here is now we have an equation, one equation with one variable."
Math,"We can just solve for y. So we get 2y is equal to y, and then we have minus 4 plus 7. So y plus 3. We can subtract y from both sides of this equation. The left hand side, 2y minus y is just y. y is equal to-- these cancel out. y is equal to 3. And then we could go back and substitute into either of these equations to solve for x. This is easier right over here, so let's substitute right over here. x needs to be equal to y minus 4. So we could say that x is equal to 3 minus 4 which is equal to negative 1."
Math,"So the solution to this system is x is equal to negative 1 and y is equal to 3. And you can verify that it works in this top equation right over here. 2 times 3 is 6 which is indeed equal to negative 1 plus 7. Now I want to show you that over here we substituted-- we had an expression that, or we had an equation, that explicitly solved for x. So we were able to substitute the x's. What I want to show you is we could have done it the other way around."
Math,"We could have solved for y and then substituted for the y's. So let's do that. And we could have substituted from one constraint into the other constraint or vice versa. Either way, we would have gotten the same exact answer. So instead of saying x is equal to y minus 4, in that second equation, if we add 4 to both sides of this equation, we get x plus 4 is equal to y. This and this is the exact same constraint. I just added 4 to both sides of this to get this constraint over here."
Math,"And now since we've solved this equation explicitly for y, we can use the first constraint, the first equation. And everywhere where we see a y, we can substitute it with x plus 4. So it's 2 times-- instead of 2 times y, we can write 2 times x plus 4. 2 times x plus 4 is equal to x plus 7. We can distribute this 2. So we get 2x plus 8 is equal to x plus 7. We can subtract x from both sides of this equation. And then we can subtract 8 from both sides of this equation, subtract 8."
Math,"The left hand side, that cancels out. We're just left with an x. On the right hand side, that cancels out, and we are left with a negative 1. And then we can substitute back over here we have y is equal to x plus 4, or so y is equal to negative 1 plus 4 which is equal to 3. So once again, we got the same answer even though this time we substituted for y instead of substituting for x. Hopefully you found that interesting.."
Math,"And we have to solve for x and y. So we're looking for x's and y's that satisfy both of these equations. Now, the easiest way to think about it is we've already solved for y in this top equation. Let me write it again. I'll write it in pink. We have y is equal to 4x minus 17.5. So this first equation is telling us, literally, by this constraint, y should be 4 times x minus 17.5. Now, the second equation says whatever y is, we had 2 times x, and that should be 6.5."
Math,"Well, the y here also has to meet this constraint up here. It also has to meet the constraint that it has to be 4 times x minus 17.5. So what we can do is, is we can substitute this value for y into this equation. Let me be clear what I'm doing. The second equation here is y plus 2x is equal to 6.5. We know that y has to be equal to this thing right here. y has to be equal to 4x minus 17.5. So let's take 4x minus 17.5, and substitute y with that. So let's put that right there."
Math,"So if we were to do that, if we were to replace this y with 4x minus 17.5, because that's what the first equation is telling us, then we get 4x minus 17.5, plus 2x is equal to 6.5. And now we have a single linear equation with one unknown. Let's solve for x. So first we have our x terms. We have a 4x, and we have a 2x. We can group them or add them together. 4x plus 2x is 6x. And then we have 6x minus 17.5 is equal to 6.5. Then we can get the 17.5 out of the way by adding it to both sides of the equation."
Math,"So this is negative 17.5, so let's add positive 17.5 to both sides of this equation. And we are left with the left-hand side is just going to be 6x, because these guys cancel out. 6x is going to be equal to-- and 6.5-- see, 6 plus 17 is 23, and then 0.5 plus 0.5 is 1. So this is going to be 24. And then we can divide both sides of this equation by 6. And you are left with x is equal to 24 over 6, which is the same thing as 4."
Math,"So we figured out the x value for the x and y pair that satisfy both of these equations. Now we need to figure out the y value. And we can do that by taking this x and putting it back into one of these equations. We can do it in to either one. We should get the same y value. So let's just do this top one up here. So if we assume x is equal to 4, this top equation tells us y is equal to 4 times x, which in this case is 4, minus 17.5. Well, this is equal to 16 minus 17.5, which is equal to negative 1.5."
Math,"So y is equal to negative 1.5. So the solution to this system is x is equal to 4, y is equal to negative 1.5. And you can even verify that these two, they definitely work for the top one if you put 4 times 4, minus 17.5, you get negative 1.5. But they also work for the second one. And let's do that. In the second one, if you take negative 1.5, plus 2 times x-- plus 2 times 4-- what does that equal? That's negative 1.5 plus 8. Well, negative 1.5 plus 8 is 6.5."
Math,So this x and y satisfy both of these equations..
Math,"That makes sure that you're making use of both constraints. So let's start with this bottom equation right here. So we have y minus x is equal to 5. It's pretty straightforward to solve for y here. We just have to add x to both sides of this equation. So add x. And so the left-hand side, these x's cancel out, the negative x and the positive x, and we're left with y is equal to 5 plus x."
Math,"Now, the whole point of me doing that, is now any time we see a y in the other equation, we can replace it with a 5 plus x. So the other equation was-- let me do it in this orange color-- 9x plus 3y is equal to 15. This second equation told us, if we just rearranged it, that y is equal to 5 plus x, so we can replace y in the second equation with 5 plus x. That makes sure we're making use of both constraints. So let's do that. We're going to replace y with 5 plus x."
Math,"So this 9x plus 3y equals 15 becomes 9x plus 3 times y. The second equation says y is 5 plus x. So we're going to put 5 plus x there instead of a y. 3 times 5 plus x is equal to 15. And now we can just solve for x. We get 9x plus 3 times 5 is 15 plus 3 times x is 3x is equal to 15. So we can add the 9x and the 3x, so we get 12x, plus 15, is equal to 15. Now we can subtract 15 from both sides, just so you get only x terms on the left-hand side."
Math,"These guys cancel each other out, and you're left with 12x is equal to 0. Now you divide both sides by 12, and you get x is equal to 0/12, or x is equal to 0. So let me scroll down a little bit. So x is equal to 0. Now if x equals 0, what is y? Well, we could substitute into either one of these equations up here. If we substitute x equals 0 in this first equation, you get 9 times 0 plus 3y is equal to 15. Or that's just a 0, so you get 3y is equal to 15."
Math,"Divide both sides by 3, you get y is equal to 15/3 or 5. y is equal to 5. And we can test that that also satisfies this equation. y, 5, minus 0 is also equal to 5. So the value x is equal to-- I'll do this in green. x is equal to 0, y is equal to 5 satisfies both of these equations. So we've done the first part. Let's do the second part, where we're asked to graph it. The second equation is pretty straightforward to graph. We actually ended up putting it in mx plus b form right there."
Math,"And actually, let me rewrite it. Let me just switch the x and the 5, so it really is in that mx plus b form. So y is equal to x plus 5. So its y-intercept is 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- and its slope is 1, right? There's a 1 implicitly being multiplied, or the x is being multiplied by 1. So it looks like Let me see how well I can draw it. The line will look like that. It has a slope of 1. You move back 1, you go down 1. You move forward 1, you go up 1. That's a pretty good job. So that right here is this equation."
Math,"Now let's graph that top equation. And we just have to put it in mx plus b form, or slope-intercept form. And I'll do that in green. So we have 9x plus 3y is equal to 15. One simplification we can do right from the get-go is every number here is divisible by 3, so let's just divide everything by 3 to make things simpler. So we get 3x plus y is equal to 5. Now we can subtract 3x from both sides. We are left with y is equal to negative 3x plus 5."
Math,"So that's what this first equation gets turned into, if you put it in slope-intercept form. y is equal to negative 3x plus 5. So if you were to graph it, the y-intercept is 5. And then its slope is negative 3. So you move 1 in the x-direction, you move down 3 in the y-direction. Move 2, you would move down 6. 2, 4, 6. Move 2, you go 2, 4, 6. So this line is going to look something like this. It's going to look something like that right there."
Math,"As you can see, the solution to this system is the point of intersection of these two lines. It's the combination of x and y that satisfy both of these. Remember, this pink line, or this red line, is all of the x's and y's that satisfy this equation: y minus x is equal to 5. This green line is all of the x's and y's, or all the combinations of them, that satisfy this first equation. Now, the one x and y combination that satisfies both is their point of intersection."
Math,"And we figured it out algebraically using substitution. That happens at x is equal to 0, y is equal to 5. x is equal to 0-- this is the x-axis-- y is equal to 5 right there.."
Math,"So they've set it up for us pretty well. They already have y explicitly solved for up here. So they tell us, this first constraint tells us that y must be equal to negative 5x plus 8. So when we go to the second constraint here, every time we see a y, we say, well, the first constraint tells us that y must be equal to negative 5x plus 8. So everywhere we see a y, we can substitute it with negative 5x plus 8. Because that's what the first constraint tells us. y is equal to that."
Math,"I don't want to be repetitive, but I really want you to internalize that's all it's saying. y is that. So every time we see a y in the second constraint, we can substitute it with that. So let's do it. So the second equation over here is 10x plus 2. And instead of writing a y there, and I've said it multiple times already, we can write a negative 5x plus 8. The first constraint tells us that's what y is. So negative 5x plus 8 is equal to negative 2. Now, we have one equation with one unknown."
Math,"We can just solve for x. We have 10x plus. So we can multiply it. We can distribute this 2 onto both of these terms. So we have 2 times negative 5x is negative 10x. And then 2 times 8 is 16. So plus 16 is equal to negative 2. Now we have 10x minus 10x. Those guys cancel out. 10x minus 10x is equal to 0. So these guys cancel out. And we're just left with 16 equals negative 2, which is crazy. We know that 16 does not equal negative 2. This is an inconsistent result."
Math,"And that's because these two lines actually don't intersect. And we could see that by actually graphing these lines. Whenever you get something like some number equalling some other number that they're clearly not equal to, that means it's an inconsistent result, It's an inconsistent system, and that these lines actually don't intersect. So let me just graph these just to make it clear. This first equation is already in slope y-intercept form. So it looks something like this. That's our x-axis."
Math,"This is our y-axis. And it's negative 5x plus 8, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And then it has a very steep downward slope. Every time you move forward 1, you have to go down 5. So it looks something like that. That's this first equation right over there. The second equation, let me rewrite it in slope y-intercept form. So it's 10x plus 2y is equal to negative 2. Let's subtract 10x from both sides. You get 2y is equal to negative 10x minus 2. Let's divide both sides by 2."
Math,"You get y is equal to negative 5x, negative 5x minus 1. So it's y-intercept is negative 1. It's right over there. And it has the same slope as this first line. So it looks like this. It's parallel. It's just shifted down a bit. So it just looks like that. So they're parallel lines. They have the same slope, different y-intercepts. We get an inconsistent result. They don't intersect. And the telltale sign of that, when you're doing it algebraically, is you get something wacky like this."
Math,"This is why it's called inconsistent. It's not consistent for 16 to be equal to negative 2. These don't intersect. There's no solution to both of these constraints, no x and y that satisfies both of them.."
Math,"Now, the first thing we might want to do is maybe get all of our x terms onto the left- or the right-hand side of the equation. And if we wanted to get rid of these x terms from the right-hand side, get them on the left-hand side, the best thing to do is to add 1/4x to both sides of this equation. So let me do that. So we're going to add 1/4x here, add 1/4x here, and you might already be sensing that something shady is going on. So let's do it. So negative 1/4x plus 1/4x. They cancel out. You get 0x."
Math,"So the left side of the equation is just 100. And then the right side of the equation, same thing. Negative 1/4x plus 1/4x. They cancel out. No x's. And you're just left with is equal to 120. Which we know is definitely not the case. 100 is not equal to 120. We got this nonsensical equation here, that 100 equals 120. So this type of system has no solution."
Math,"You know it has no solution because in order for it to have any solution, these two numbers would have to be equal to each other, and they are not equal to each other. And if you look at the original equations, it might jump out at you why they have no solutions. Both of these lines, or both of these equations, if you view them as lines, have the exact same slope. But they have different y-intercepts. So if I just were to do a really quick graph here. That's my y-axis, that is my x-axis, so it's y and x."
Math,"This first graph over here, its y-intercept is 100. Let me do it a little bit lower. Its y-intercept-- let's say that that is 100, so it intersects right there. And there's a slope of negative 1/4. So maybe it looks something like this. That's that first line. This second line-- I'll do it in pink right here-- y is equal to negative 1/4x plus 120, its y-intercept might be right here at 120. But it has the same slope, negative 1/4, so its slope, the line would look something like this."
Math,"So you see that there are no x and y points that satisfy both of these equations. Another way to think about it. If y-- you take an x. This first equation says, OK, you take your x, multiply it by negative 1/4, and add 100, and that's going to give you y. Now, here we say, well, you take that same x, and you multiply it by negative 1/4 and add 120, and that has to be equal to y. Well, the only way that that would ever be true is if 100 and 120 were the same number, and they're not the same number."
Math,"So you're never going to have a solution of this system. These two lines are never going to intersect, and that's because they have the exact same slope.."
Math,"""The fruit prices. Arbegla, tell them the riddle of the fruit prices."" And so Arbegla says, ""Well,"" ""we wanna keep track of how much our fruit costs, but we forgot"" ""to actually log how much it costs when we went to the market but we know how much in total we spent"" ""we know much we got. We know that one week ago, when we went to"" ""the fruit market, we bought two, two, pounds of"" ""apples, we bought two pounds of apples, and one pound of bananas."" ""one pound, I guess, of bananans, bananas."
Math,"And the total cost"" ""that, time, was three dollars, so there was three dollars, three dollars"" in total cost. And then when we went the time before that we went the time before that we bought six pounds of bananas or six pounds of apples I should say Six pounds of apples. And three pounds three pounds of bananas. Ba-nanas. And the total cost at that point was fifteen dollars."
Math,"So what is the cost of apples and bananas? So you look at the bird: The bird looks at you, the bird whispers into the king's ear, and the king says Well the bird says we'll just start defining some variables here, so we'll start expressing this thing algebraically So you go about doing that. What we want to figure out is the cost of apples and the cost of bananas. Per pound. So we set some variables. So let's... let a= the cost cost of apples, apple per pound."
Math,"Per pound And let's let b = the cost of bananas. Ba-nanas. Bananas per pound. So how could we interpret this first information right here? Two pounds of apples and a pound of bananas cost $3. So how much are the apples going to cost? Well it's going to cost 2, two pounds times the cost per pound, times a, that's going to be the total cost of apples in this scenarios, and what's the total cost of the banana? Well it's one pound times the cost per pound."
Math,"So, you're just going to have b, that's the total cost of the bananas, cause we know we bought one the total cost of the apples and bananas are going to be 2a+b and we know what that total cost is it is, it is $3. Now let's do the same thing for the other time we went to the market. Simply Six pounds of apple, the total cost is going to be six pounds times A dollars per pound and the total cost of banas is going to be well we bought three poiund of bananas."
Math,"and the cost per pound is b and so the total cost of apples and bananas this scenario is going to be = to 15 is going to be = to $15 so let's think about how we might want to solve it we could use elimination we could use substitution whatever we want, we might do it graphically let's try it first with elimination."
Math,"so the first thing I might want to do is is maybe I want to eliminate let's say I want to eliminate the a variable right over here so I have two a over here, I have six a over here so if I multiply this entire right equation by -3 then this 2a would become a -6a and then it might be able to cancel out with that so let me do that let me multiply this entire equation times -3 times negative three so -3 * 2a is -6a -3 * b is -3b and then -3 * 3 is -9 and now we can essentially add the two equations or essentially add the left side of this to the left side of that or the right side of this equation to the right side of that we're essentially adding the same thing to both sides of this equation because we know this is equal to that So let's do that let's do it So on the left hand side, 6a and 6a cancel out."
Math,"But something else interesting happens, the 3b and the 3b cancels out as well. So we're just left with 0 on the left hand side. And on the right hand side, what do we have? 15 - 9 = 6. So we get this bizarre statement! All of our variables have gone away And we're left with this bizarre nonsensical statement that 0 = 6, which we know is definitely not the case."
Math,"So what's going on over here? What's going on? And then, you you you say, what's going on and you look at the bird 'cause the bird seems to be the most knowledgeable person in the room or at least the most knowledgeable vertebrate in the room."
Math,"And so the bird whispers into the king's ear and the king says, ""Well, he says that there's no solution and you should at least try to graph it to see why."" And you say, well, the bird seems to know what he's talking about So let me attempt to graph these two equations and see what's going on."
Math,"And so what you do is, you take each of the equation and you like, when you graph it, you like to put it in kind of the y-intercept form or slope intercept form and so you do that, so you say, well let me solve both of these for b so if you want to solve this first equation for b you just subtract 2a from both sides if you subtract 2a from both sides of this first equation you get b is = to -2a + 3. Now solve this second equation for b. So the first thing you might wanna do is subtract 6a from both sides."
Math,"So you would get, you would get, I'll do it right over, let me do it right over here. You would get 3b, 3b is = to -6a plus 15 and then you can divide both sides by 3 you get b is = to -2a plus, plus 5. So the second equation, let me revert back to that other shade of green, is b is = to -2a plus 5. And we haven't even graphed it yet, but it looks like something interesting is going on."
Math,"They both have the exact same slope when you solve in terms, when you solve for b but they seem to have different, let's call them, b-intercepts let's graph it to actually see what's going on so let me get, draw some axes over here, let's call that my b-axis and then this could be my, a axis And this first equation has a b-intercept of positive 3 so let's see, one, two, three four five the first one has a b-intercept of positive three and it has a slope of negative 2 So you go down or you go to the right one you go down two."
Math,"Go to the right one, you go down two. So the line looks something like this. I'm trying my best to draw it straight. So it looks it looks something something like that And I'll just draw this green one. This green one, our b-intercept is 5 so it's right over here."
Math,"but we have the exact same slope the slope of -2, so it looks it looks something something like that right over there and you immediately see now that the bird was right There is no solution because these two constraints represent or can be represented by lines that don't intersect. So the lines don't, don't intersect. In-ter-sect."
Math,"They don't intersect, and so the bird is right there's no solution, there's no x and y that can make this statement equal true! Or that can make 0 = 6, there is no possible, there is no overlap between these two things. And so something gets into your brain. You realize that Arbegla is trying to stump you. And you say, Arbegla, you have given me in-con-sistent information! This is an in-con-sistent system of equations! In. In...con...sistent."
Math,"Which happens to be the word that is sometimes used to refer to a system that has no solutions, where the lines do not intersect. And there fore this information is incorrect We cannot assume that the apple or banana Either you are lying, which is possible, or you accounted for it wrong Or maybe the prices of apples and bananas actually changed between the two visits of the market. At which point the bird whispered into the King's ear, and says, oh, this character isn't so bad at this algebra stuff.."
Math,"My apologies. I realize now what the mistake was. There was a slight, I guess, typing error or writing error. In the first week, when they went to the market and bought two pounds of apples and one pound of bananas, it wasn't a $3 cost. It was a $5 cost. Now surely considering how smart you and this bird seem to be, you surely could figure out what is the per pound cost of apples and what is the per pound cost of bananas."
Math,"So you think for a little bit, is there now going to be a solution? So let's break it down using the exact same variables. You say, well if a is the cost of apples per pound and b is the cost of bananas, this first constraint tells us that two pounds of apples are going to cost 2a, because it's b dollars per pound. And one pound of bananas is going to cost b dollars because it's one pound times b dollars per pound is now going to cost $5. This is the corrected number."
Math,"And we saw from the last scenario, this information hasn't changed. Six pounds of apples is going to cost 6a, six pounds times a dollars per pound. And three pounds of bananas is going to cost 3b, three pounds times b dollars per pound. The total cost of the apples and bananas in this trip we are given is $15. So once again, you say, well let me try to solve this maybe through elimination. And once again, you say well let me cancel out the a's. I have 2a here. I have 6a here."
Math,"If I multiply the 2a here by negative 3, then this will become a negative 6a. And it might be able to cancel out with all of this business. So you do that. You multiply this entire equation. You can't just multiply one term. You have to multiply the entire equation times negative 3 if you want the equation to still hold. And so we're multiplying by negative 3 so 2a times negative 3 is negative 6a. b times negative 3 is negative 3b. And then 5 times negative 3 is negative 15."
Math,"And now something fishy starts to look like it's about to happen. Because when you add the left hand side of this blue equation or this purplish equation to the green one, you get 0. All of these things right over here just cancel out. And on the right hand side, 15 minus 15, that is also equal to 0. And you get 0 equals 0, which seems a little bit better than the last time you worked through it. Last time we got 0 equals 6. But 0 equals 0 doesn't really tell you anything about the x's and y's."
Math,"This is true. This is absolutely true that 0 does definitely equals 0, but it doesn't tell you any information about x and y. And so then the bird whispers in the King's ear, and then the King says, well the bird says you should graph it to figure out what's actually going on. And so you've learned that listening to the bird actually makes a lot of sense. So you try to graph these two constraints. So let's do it the same way. We'll have a b axis. That's our b axis. And we will have our a axis."
Math,"Let we mark off some markers here-- one, two, three, four, five and one, two, three, four, five. So this first equation right over here, if we subtract 2a from both sides, I'm just going to put it into slope intercept form, you get b is equal to negative 2a plus 5. All I did is subtract 2a from both sides. And if we were to graph that, our b-intercept when a is equal to 0, b is equal to 5. So that's right over here. And our slope is negative 2."
Math,"Every time you add 1 to a-- so if a goes from 0 to 1-- b is going to go down by 2. So go down by two, go down by 2. So this first white equation looks like this if we graph the solution set. These are all of the prices for bananas and apples that meet this constraint. Now let's graph this second equation. If we subtract 6a from both sides, we get 3b is equal to negative 6a plus 15. And now we could divide both sides by 3, divide everything by 3. We are left with b is equal to negative 2a plus 5."
Math,"Well this is interesting. This looks very similar, or it looks exactly the same. Our b-intercept is 5 and our slope is negative 2a. So this is essentially the same line. So these are essentially the same constraints. And so you start to look at it a little bit confused, and you say, OK, I see why we got 0 equals 0. There's actually an infinite number of solutions. You pick any x and then the corresponding y for each of these could be a solution for either of these things."
Math,"So there's an infinite number of solutions. But you start to wonder, why is this happening? And so the bird whispers again into the King's ear and the King says, well the bird says this is because in both trips to the market the same ratio of apples and bananas was bought. In the green trip versus the white trip, you bought three times as many apples, bought three times as many bananas, and you had three times the cost."
Math,"So in any situation for any per pound prices of apples and bananas, if you buy exactly three times the number of apples, three times the number bananas, and have three times the cost, that could be true for any prices. And so this is actually it's consistent. We can't say that Arbegla is lying to us, but it's not giving us enough information. This is what we call, this is a consistent system. It's consistent information here. So let me write this down. This is consistent. And it is consistent, 0 equals 0."
Math,"There's no shadiness going on here. But it's not enough information. This system of equations is dependent. It is dependent. And you have an infinite number of solutions. Any point this line represents a solution. So you tell Arbegla, well, if you really want us to figure this out, you need to give us more information. And preferably buy a different ratio of apples to bananas.."
Math,"So just to start off with, if we're dealing with systems of linear equations in two dimensions, there's only three possibilities that the lines or the equations can have relative to each other. So let me draw the three possibilities. So let me draw three coordinate axes. So that's my first x-axis and y-axis. Let me draw another one. That is x and that is y. Let me draw one more, because there's only three possibilities in two dimensions. x and y if we're dealing with linear equations."
Math,"So you can have the situation where the lines just intersect in one point. Let me do this. So you could have one line like that and maybe the other line does something like that and they intersect at one point. You could have the situation where the two lines are parallel. So you could have a situation-- actually let me draw it over here-- where you have one line that goes like that and the other line has the same slope but it's shifted. It has a different y-intercept, so maybe it looks like this."
Math,"And you have no points of intersection. And then you could have the situation where they're actually the same line, so that both lines have the same slope and the same y-intercept. So really they are the same line. They intersect on an infinite number of points. Every point on either of those lines is also a point on the other line."
Math,"So just to give you a little bit of the terminology here, and we learned this in the last video, this type of system where they don't intersect, where you have no solutions, this is an inconsistent system. And by definition, or I guess just taking the opposite of inconsistent, both of these would be considered consistent. But then within consistent, there's obviously a difference. Here we only have one solution. These are two different lines that intersect in one place."
Math,And here they're essentially the same exact line. And so we differentiate between these two scenarios by calling this one over here independent and this one over here dependent. So independent-- both lines are doing their own thing. They're not dependent on each other. They're not the same line. They will intersect at one place. Dependent-- they're the exact same line. Any point that satisfies one line will satisfy the other. Any points that satisfies one equation will satisfy the other.
Math,"So with that said, let's see if this system of linear equations right here is dependent or independent. So they're kind of having us assume that it's going to be consistent, that we're going to intersect in one place or going to intersect in an infinite number of places. And the easiest way to do this-- we already have this second equation here. It's already in slope-intercept form. We know the slope is negative 2, the y-intercept is 8."
Math,"Let's put this first equation up here in slope-intercept form and see if it has a different slope or a different intercept. Or maybe it's the same line. So we have 4x plus 2y is equal to 16. We can subtract 4x from both sides. What we want to do is isolate the y on the left hand side. So let's subtract 4x from both sides. The left hand side-- we are just left with a 2y. And then the right hand side, we have a negative 4x plus 16."
Math,"I just wrote the negative 4 in front of the 16, just so that we have it in the traditional slope-intercept And now we can divide both sides of this equation by 2, so that we can isolate the y on the left hand side. Divide both sides by 2. We are left with y is equal to negative 4 divided by 2 is negative 2x plus 16 over 2 plus 8."
Math,"So all I did is algebraically manipulate this top equation up And when I did that, when I solved essentially for y, I got this right over here, which is the exact same thing as the second equation. We have the exact same slope, negative 2, negative 2, and we have the exact same y-intercept, 8 and 8. If I were to graph these equations-- that's my x-axis, and that is my y-axis-- both of them have a y-intercept at 8 and then have a slope of negative 2."
Math,"So they look something-- I'm just drawing an approximation of it-- but they would look something like that. So maybe this is the graph of this equation right here, this first equation. And then the second equation will be the exact same graph. It has the exact same y-intercept and the exact same slope. So clearly these two lines are dependent. They have an infinite number of points that are common to both of them, because they're the same line.."
Math,"Then identify one system of two lines that does not have a solution. So let's do the first part first. So a single solution. And they say identify one system, but we can see here there's actually going to be two systems that have a single solution. And when we talk about a single solution, we're talking about a single x and y value that will satisfy both equations in the system."
Math,"So if we look right here at the points of intersection, this point right there, that satisfies this equation y is equal to 0.1x plus 1. And it also satisfies, well, this blue line, but the graph that that line represents, y is equal to 4x plus 10. So this dot right here, that point represents a solution to both of these. Or I guess another way to think about it, it represents an x and y value that satisfy both of these constraints."
Math,"So one system that has one solution is the system that has y is equal to 0.1x plus 1, and then this blue line right here, which is y is equal to 4x plus 10. Now, they only want us to identify one system of two lines that has a single solution. We've already done that. But just so you see it, there's actually another system here. So this is one system right here, or another system would be the green line and this red line."
Math,"This point of intersection right here, once again, that represents an x and y value that satisfies both the equation y is equal to 0.1x plus 1, and this point right here satisfies the equation y is equal to 4x minus 6. So if you look at this system, there's one solution, because there's one point of intersection of these two equations or these two lines, and this system also has one solution because it has one point of intersection."
Math,"Now, the second part of the problem, they say identify one system of two lines that does not have a single solution or does not have a solution, so no solution. So in order for there to be no solution, that means that the two constraints don't overlap, that there's no point that is common to both equations or there's no pair of x, y values that's common to both equations. And that's the case of the two parallel lines here, this blue line and this green line."
Math,"Because they never intersect, there's no coordinate on the coordinate plane that satisfies both equations. So there's no x and y that satisfy both. So the second part of the question, a system that has no solution is y is equal to 4x plus 10, and then the other one is y is equal to 4x minus 6. And notice, they have the exact same slope, and they're two different lines, they have different intercepts, so they never, ever intersect, and that's why they have no solutions.."
Math,"You have the first scenario which is kind of where we started off, where you have two systems that just intersect in one place. And then you have essentially one solution. So if you were to graphically represent it you have one solution right over there, one solution. And this means that the two constraints are consistent and the two constraints are independent of each other. They're not the exact same line, consistent and independent."
Math,"Then you have the other scenario where they're consistent, they intersect,but they're essentially the same line. They intersect everywhere. So this is one of the constraints for one of the equations, and the other one if you look at it, if you graph it, it is actually the exact same one. So here you have an infinite number of solutions. It's consistent, you do have solutions here, but they're dependent equations. It's a dependent system."
Math,"And then the last scenario, and this is when you're dealing in two dimensions, the last scenario is where your two constraints just don't intersect with each other. One might look like this, and then the other might look like this. They have the exact same slope but they have different intercepts. So this there is no solution, they never intersect. And we call this an inconsistent system. And if you wanted to think about what would happen just think about what's going on here."
Math,"Here you have different slopes. And if you think about it, two different lines with different slopes are definitely going to intersect in exactly one place. Here they have the same slope and same y-intercept, so you have an infinite number of solutions. Here you have the same slope but different y-intercepts, and you get no solutions. So the times when you're solving systems where things are going to get a little bit weird are when you have the same slope."
Math,"And if you think about it, what defines the slope, and I encourage you to test this out with different equations, is when you have-- if you have your x's and y's, or you have your a's and b's or you have your variables on the same side of an equation, where they have the same ratio with respect to each other. So with that, kind of keeping that in mind, let's see if we can think about what types of solutions we might find. So let's take this down."
Math,"So they say determine how many solutions exist for the system of equations. So you have 10x minus 2y is equal to 4, and 10x minus 2y is equal to 16. So just based on what we just talked about the x's and the y's are on the same side of the equation and the ratio is 10 to negative 2. Same ratio. So something strange is going to happen here. But when we have the same kind of combination of x's and y's in the first one we get 4, and on the second one we get 16. So that seems a little bit bizarre."
Math,"Another way to think about it, we have the same number of x's, the same number of y's but we got a different number on the right hand side. So if you were to simplify this, and we could even look at the hints to see what it says, you'll see that you're going to end up with the same slope but different y-intercepts. So we convert both the slope intercept form right over here and you see one, the blue one is y is equal to 5x minus 2, and the green one is y is equal to 5x minus 8."
Math,"Same slope, same ratio between the x's and the Y's, but you have different values right over here. You have different y-intercepts. So here you have no solutions. That is this scenario right over here if you were to graph it. So no solutions, check our answer. Let's go to the next question. So let's look at this one right over here. So we have negative 5 times x and negative 1 times y. We have 4 times x and 1 times y."
Math,"So it looks like the ratio if then we're looking at the x's and y's always on the left hand side right over here, it looks like the ratios of x's and y's are different. You have essentially 5 x's for every one y, or you could say negative 5 x's for every negative 1 y, and here you have 4 x's for every 1 y. So this is fundamentally a different ratio. So right off the bat you could say well these are going to intersect in exactly one place."
Math,"If you were to put this into slope intercept form, you will see that they have different slopes. So you could say this has one solution and you can check your answer. And you could look at the solution just to verify. And I encourage you to do this. So you see the blue one if you put in the slope intercept form negative 5x plus 10 and you take the green one into slope intercept form negative 4x minus 8. So different slopes, they're definitely going to intersect in exactly one place."
Math,"You're going to have one solution. Let's try another one. So here we have 2x plus y is equal to negative 3. And this is pretty clear, you have 2x plus y is equal to negative 3. These are the exact same equations. So it's consistent information, there's definitely solutions. But there's an infinite number of solutions right over here. This is a dependent system. So there are infinite number of solutions here and we can check our answer. Let's do one more because that was a little bit too easy."
Math,"OK so this is interesting right over here, we have it in different forms. 2x plus y is equal to negative 4, y is equal to negative 2x minus 4. So let's take this first blue equation and put it into slope intercept form. If we did that you would get, if you just subtract 2x from both sides you get y is equal to negative 2x minus 4, which is the exact same thing as this equation right over here. So once again they're the exact same equation. You have an infinite number of solutions."
Math,"Check our answer, and you can look at the solution right You convert the blue one into slope intercept and you get the exact same thing as what you saw in the green one.."
Math,"So let me draw my axes here. Let's draw my axes. So this is going to be my vertical axis. That could be one of the variables. And then this is my horizontal axis. That's one of the other variables. And maybe, for sake of convention, this could be x, and this could be y, but they're whatever our two variables are. So it's a system of two linear equations. So if we're graphing them, each of the linear equations in two variables can be represented by a line. Now, there's only three scenarios here."
Math,"One scenario is where the lines don't intersect at all. So the only way that you're going to have two lines in two dimensions that don't intersect is if they have the same slope and they have different y-intercepts. So that's one scenario, but that's not the scenario that's being described here. They say, you have found more than one solution that satisfies the system. Here there are no solutions. So that's not the scenario that we're talking about."
Math,"There's another scenario where they intersect in exactly one place. So they intersect in exactly one place. There's one point, one xy-coordinate right over there that satisfies both of these constraints, but this also is not the scenario they're talking about. They're telling us that you have found more than one solution that satisfies the system. So this isn't the scenario either. So the only other scenario that we can have-- we don't have parallel lines that don't intersect."
Math,"We don't have lines that only intersect in one place. The only other scenario is that we're dealing with a situation where both linear equations are essentially the same constraint. They both are essentially representing the same xy-relationship. That's the only way that I can have two lines, and this only applies to linear relationship and lines. But the only way that two lines can intersect more than one place is if they intersect everywhere."
Math,"So in this situation, we know that we must have an infinite number of solutions. So which of these choices say that? This one right here-- ""there are infinitely many more solutions to the system""-- right over there.."
Math,"So let's figure out what our unknown is first. Well, our unknown is how old he is right now. I'm just arbitrarily using x. We always like to use x. But I could've really set it to be anything. But let's say x is equal to how old he is right now. How old-- not how hold. How old he is now. Now, what do we know about how old he will be in 40 years? Well, he's going to be how old he is now plus 40. So let me write that down. So in 40 years Imran is going to be x plus 40, plus this 40 right over here."
Math,"But they give us another piece of information. This by itself isn't enough to figure out how old he is right now. But they tell us in 40 years, Imran will be 11 times as old as he is right now. So that's saying that this quantity right over here, x plus 40, is going to be 11 times x. In 40 years, he's going to be 11 times as old as he is right now. So this is going to be times 11. You take x, multiply it times 11, you're going to get how old he's going to be in 40 years."
Math,"So let's write that down as an equation. You take x, multiply it by 11, so 11 times as old as he is right now is how old he is going to be in 40 years. And we have set up a nice little, tidy linear equation So we just have to solve for x. So let's get all the x's on the left-hand side. We have more x's here than on the right-hand side. So we avoid negative numbers, let's stick all the x's here. So if I want to get rid of this x on the right hand side, I'd want to subtract an x."
Math,"But obviously, I can't just do it to the right. Otherwise, the equality won't be true anymore. I need to do it on the left as well. And so I am left with-- if I have 11 of something and I take away 1 of them, I'm left with 10 of that something. So I'm left with 10 times x is equal to-- well, these x's, x minus x is just 0. That was the whole point. It's going to be equal to 40. And you could do this in your head at this point, but let's just solve it formally."
Math,"So if we want a 1 coefficient here, we'd want to divide by 10, but we've got to do that to both sides. And so we are left with-- and we could have our drum roll now. We are left with x is equal to 4 years old. x is equal to 4. So our answer to the question, how old is Imran right now? He is 4 years old. And let's verify this. If he's 4 years old right now, in 40 years he's going to be 44 years old. And 44 years old is indeed 11 times older than 4 years old."
Math,"This is a factor of 11 years, so it all worked out.."
Math,"How old is Ben now? Once again, it's a good idea to try to do this on your own first, and then I'll work through it. What's the unknown here? Well, the unknown here is how old is Ben now. So let's set a variable equal to that, and we do x or y. But since Ben starts with a b, let's use b for Ben. So let's let b equal Ben's current age, Ben's age now. Let's see how all of this other information relates to Ben's current age, and then maybe we can set up some equation and then solve for things."
Math,"I'll do it a little bit more structured in this one. You could have done many of the problems we've been working on in this way. Let's think about Ben, and then let's think about William. I'll do William in blue here. So let's think about William. And then there's two points in time we're talking about. We're talking about now, today, and we're going to talk about 12 years ago. Over here, let's call that now. This will be our now column, and then this will be our 12 years ago."
Math,"Let's see what we can fill in here. What is Ben's age now? Well, we just defined that as the variable b. That's the unknown. That's what we have to figure out. So let's just stick that there. That's just going to be b. Well, what's Ben's age 12 years ago? So maybe we want to express it in terms of b. If he's b now, 12 years ago, he was just b minus 12. Fair enough. Now what is William's age today? Well, this first sentence gave us the information. William is 4 times as old as Ben."
Math,"And we can assume that they're talking about today, is 4 times as old as Ben. So if Ben is b, William is going to be 4b. And so how old was William 12 years ago? Well, if he's 4b right now, 12 years ago, he'll just be 12 less than that. So he's 4b now. 12 years ago, he was 4b minus 12. So that's kind of interesting. But we haven't quite yet made use of the second statement. This is William 12 years ago. 12 years ago, William was 7 times as old as Ben."
Math,"So 12 years ago, this number is going to be 7 times this number. Or another way to think about, take this number and multiply it by 7, and you're going to get this number. 12 years ago, Ben's age is 1/7 of William's age, or William's age is 7 times Ben's age. So let's see if we can set that up as an equation. We can have-- let me write this down-- 7 times Ben's age 12 years ago, b minus 12, is going to be equal to William's age. And it seems like we've done the hard part. We've set up the equation."
Math,"Now we just use a little bit of our algebraic tools to solve for b. So let's do that. The first thing we might want to do, we could distribute the 7, so 7 times b, 7 times, essentially, a negative 12. We have 7b minus 7 times 12-- let's see. That's 84-- is going to be equal to 4b minus 12. This whole expression is literally 7 times Ben's age 12 years ago. Now what can we do to solve this? Well, we can subtract 4b from both sides, so let's do that. I could do two steps at the same time."
Math,"Well, actually, let's just keep it simple. I'm going to subtract 4b from both sides. That goes away. On the right-hand side, I have a negative 12. On the left-hand side, I am left with 7b minus 4b is 3b. And then I still have a minus 84. Well, I want to get rid of this negative 84, this minus 84 on the left-hand side. So let's add 84 to both sides. On the left-hand side, I'm just left with 3b. And on the right-hand side, I have negative 12 plus 84, or 84 minus 12, which is 72."
Math,"Now if I want to solve for b, I just have to divide both sides of that equation by 3. And so I am left with b is equal to-- and now we have our drum roll-- 72/3. And you might be able to do that in your head. It would be 24, I believe. You could work it out on paper if you have trouble. Let's just do it real quick. 72, 3 goes into 7 two times. You get a 2 times 3 is 6, subtract, you bring down the 2, 3 goes into 12 four times. So b is equal to 24."
Math,"Going back to our question, what is Ben's age now? It is 24. And let's verify that this is actually the case. They're telling us that William is 4 times as old as Ben. So what is William's current age? Well, 4 times 24 is 96, so William is a senior. We should call him Mr. William. He is 96 years old. Maybe he's Ben's grandfather or great-grandfather. Then they say 12 years ago, William-- well, 12 years ago, William was 84 years old. So he was 84 years old. They say that's 7 times as old as Ben."
Math,"Well, 12 years ago, if he's 24 now, Ben was 12. And indeed, 84 is 7 times 12, so it all worked out.."
Math,"So let's think about this a little bit. We're asking how many years will it take. That's what we don't know. That's what we're curious about. How many years will it take for Arman to be three times as old as Diya? So let's set some variable-- let's say, y for years. Let's say y is equal to years it will take."
Math,"So given that, can we now set up an equation, given this information, to figure out how many years it will take for Arman to be three times as old as Diya? Well, let's think about how old Arman will be in y years. How old will he be? Let me write here. In y years, Arman is going to be how old? Arman is going to be-- well, he's 18 right now-- and in y years, he's going to be y years older. So in y years, Arman is going to be 18 plus y."
Math,"And what about Diya? How old will she be in y years? Well, she's 2 now, and in y years, she will just be 2 plus y. So what we're curious about, now that we know this, is how many years will it take for this quantity, for this expression, to be three times this quantity? So we're really curious. We want to solve for y such that 18 plus y is going to be equal to 3 times 2 plus y. Notice, this is Arman in y years. This is Diya in y years."
Math,"And we're saying that what Arman's going to be in y years is three times what Diya is going to be in y years. So we've set up our equation. Now we can just solve it. So let's take this step by step. So the left hand side-- and maybe I'll do this in a new color, just so I don't have to keep switching-- so on the left hand side, I still have 18 plus y. And on the right hand side, I can distribute this 3. So 3 times 2 is 6. 3 times y is 3y. 6 plus 3y."
Math,"And then it's always nice to get all of our constants on one side of the equation, all of our variables on the other side of the equation. So we have a 3y over here. We have more y's on the right hand side than the left hand So let's get rid of the y's on the left hand side. You could do it either way, but you'd end up with negative numbers. So let's subtract a y from each side. And we are left with, on the left hand side, 18. And on the right hand side you have 6 plus 3 y's. Take away one of those y's."
Math,"You're going to be left with 2 y's. Now we can get rid of the constant term here. So we will subtract 6 from both sides. 18 minus 6 is 12. The whole reason why we subtracted 6 from the right was to get rid of this, 6 minus 6 is 0, so you have 12 is equal to 2y. Two times the number of years it will take is 12, and you could probably solve this in your head. But if we just want a one-coefficient year, we would divide by 2 on the right."
Math,"Whatever we do to one side of an equation, we have to do it on the other side. Otherwise, the equation will not still be an equation. So we're left with y is equal to 6, or y is equal to 6. So going back to the question, how many years will it take for Arman to be three times as old as Diya? Well, it's going to take six years. Now, I want you to verify this. Think about it. Is this actually true? Well, in six years, how old is Arman going to be? He's going to be 18 plus 6. We now know that this thing is 6."
Math,"So in six years, Arman is going to be 18 plus 6, which is 24 years old. How old is Diya going to be? Well, she's going to be 2 plus 6, which is 8 years old. And lo and behold, 24 is, indeed, three times as old In 6 years-- Arman is 24, Diya is 8-- Arman is three times as old as Diya, and we are done.."
Math,"How many kilometers did Yochanan cover by walking, and how many kilometers did he cover by travelling on the bus? It's fascinating. So I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about on your own. Alright, so let's just define some variables here."
Math,"How many kilometers did he cover by walking? Let's call this W and how many kilometers did he cover by travelling on the bus? Let's call that, Let's call that B and so what do we know? We know that the kilometers and I can actually even draw it just to make sure that we're visualizing this thing, right? So this right over here is his home, that's his home and then he is going to travel and see they tell us, they tell us that it is 35 kilometers to school so this is his school right over here."
Math,"I'll draw a bigger building, that's his school, and we know that this distance is 35, 35 kilometers and we also know that it took one and a half hours. One and a half hours, now he traveled at different rates for different distances. So he traveled some distance to the school bus so this is, or to the bus stop, so that's the bus stop, right over there, and we're seeing this distance to the bus stop, that's how much he covered by walking."
Math,"So this right over here, this distance, right over here, that is W and the rest of the distance, he covered by the bus, so the rest of this distance, all of this distance right over there, that is going to be B."
Math,"So what do we know? We know the distance covered by walking plus the distance covered by bus is going to be 35 kilometers, 35 kilometers here, this is the entire, that is the entire distance from home to school, so we know that W plus B, W plus B, plus B is equal to 35 kilometers, is equal to 35 kilometers and just with one equation, we're not going to be able to figure out what W and B are but we have another constraint. We know the total amount of time."
Math,"So the total amount of time is going to be one and half hours, so we'll just write that over here. This is going to be 1.5, so what's the time traveled by, what's the time he walks? Let me write this over here, time time walking, we'll that's going to be the distance walking divided by the rate walking."
Math,"So the distance walking is W kilometers W kilometers divided by his rate, the distance divided by your rate is gonna give you your time, so let's see, his rate is five kilometers per hour, five kilometers per hour and so you're gonna have kilometers cancel kilometers and if you divide by or if you have one over hours in the denominator, that's going to be the same thing, this is gonna be W over five hours, so the units work out."
Math,"So his time walking is W over five, W over five and by that same logic, his time on the bus is going to be the distance on the bus divided by, divided by the average speed of the school bus, so this is going to be 60. This is all going to be in hours and now we can solve this system of equations. We have two linear equations with two unknowns. We should be able to find W and B that satisfy both of these."
Math,"Now what's an easy thing to do? Let's see, if I can multiply this second equation by negative five, and I'm gonna, this is going to be a negative W here so it'll cancel out with this W up there. So let's do that, let's multiply the second equation by, I'm just gonna switch to one color here, so this top equation is going to be W plus B is equal to 35."
Math,"This bottom equation, if I multiply both sides by negative five, so both sides by negative five, I'm going to multiply both sides by negative five I'm going to get negative five times W over five is negative W, negative five times B over 60. Let's see, it's gonna be, it's going to be negative five over 60, that's negative 1/12, so this is negative B over 12 and then it is going to be equal to 1.5 times negative five is negative 7.5, negative 7.5."
Math,"Now we can just add the left and right hand sides of these two equations. Now let me, I can do this a little bit neater, let me actually delete, let me make these line up a little bit better so that we, delete that, make this, so this first equation was, whoops, this first equation was W plus B is equal to 35 now they line up better and now we can add the left hand sides of these equations and the right hand sides, so the left hand sides, the W's cancel out. That's what we wanted."
Math,"Now B minus B over 12 or B minus the twelfth of B, well that's going to be 11/12B, 11/12B is equal to, let's see, 35 minus 7.5, see 35 minus seven would be 28 and then another half this would be 27.5. 27.5 and since I'm dealing with a fraction here, let me write this as a fraction so this is the same thing as 55 over two. Let's me just write it this way. This is the same thing as 55 over two. Now to solve for B, I just have to multiply both sides times this reciprocal."
Math,"I'll switch colors just to ease the monotony. So multiply both sides by 12 over 11, 12 over 11, what we get, these cancel out, what we get is that B, so I'll do this in this color, B is equal to, let's see, I have a 12 in the numerator two in the denominator so I can make that a six and a one, then I have a 55 and 11, I can divide both by 11, so it's gonna be five and a one."
Math,"So it's five times six, B is equal to 30 and B was in kilometers so if he travels 30 kilometers, 30 kilometers by bus, B is equal to 30 kilometers, and the amount that he walks, well, we can figure that out. If this is 30, well the amount that he walks is going to be five. This is going to be five kilometers, W, let me write this, W is equal to five kilometers. He walks five kilometers and then he goes by the bus 30 kilometers.."
Math,"How many machines and workers were there? I encourage you to pause the video. This is a good little problem over here. All right, so let's define some variables. So let's say M is equal to the number of machines, and let's say that W is equal to the number of workers. Those seem like reasonable variables. So what does the first sentence tell us? It tells us one day each machine produced 14 toys."
Math,"So if each machine produced 14 toys, what is the total number of toys that are going to be produced? Well, the total number of toys that are going to be produced is going to be the number per machine times the number of machines. So this is 14M toys produced. So this is what is produced. Produced, right over there."
Math,"And then how many toys are going to be packed? Well, if each worker packed two toys, they tell us there, each worker packed two toys, so the total number that's going to be packed is going to be two toys per worker times the number of workers. So that right over there, that's the number of toys packed. And then they tell us the number of toys that remain, the total that remains unpacked. So the total that remains unpacked, we know that that is 40. Let me do that in a neutral color."
Math,"So 40, for 40, so that we could view the 40 as produced, but not packed. Produced, not packed. That's the number, the total the remain unpacked. Well, how do we relate produced and packed to the produced that are not packed? Well, if we take the total that were produced, we subtract out the number that were packed, we're gonna be left with the total that are unpacked. So just like that, we're able to set up a linear relationship between M and W."
Math,"Well, just one isn't enough to solve for M and W, but we have another relationship. They say, additionally, the number of workers that day, so the number of workers that day. I could say W. I'll write it over here. W, the number of workers that day, was eight less than seven times the number of machines. Or you could say it was equal to seven times the number of machines minus eight. That would be eight less than seven times the number of machines. 7M minus eight."
Math,"And now we have two equations with two unknowns. If things work out well, we might be able to actually solve for W and M. So there is a bunch of ways to do it. Since this equation already has W explicitly solved for, we can do some substitution here. We can take this W and substitute it in for this W. Or, actually I should say, we could take 7M minus eight and substitute it in for this W, since the M and W, the pair that we wanna find, need to satisfy both equations."
Math,"And so we are going to get, we're going to get 14M minus, minus two, minus two times, let me do that in a, so minus two times, and instead of a W, I can write the 7M minus eight. So 7M minus eight, and we get that equals 40, is equal to 40, so we get, now it's just a little bit of algebra. 14M and then, let's see, I'll do everything in a neutral color now. So negative two times 7M is negative 14M, and then negative two times negative eight is plus 16, and then that's going to be equal to 40."
Math,"Now, 14M minus 14M, that's just going to be zero, and we're left that 16 is equal to 40. Well, that's never going to be true. 16 is never going to be equal to 40. Doesn't matter what M and W are. In fact, M and W have been eliminated from this equation. This is impossible. This right over here is impossible, for 16 to be equal to 40, and because of that, there are no solutions to this. There's no M and W pair that matches the constraints they gave us, so there is no solution. No solution."
Math,I'll put that in a little square there..
Math,"How many acres of broccoli crops and how many acres of spinach crops does Farmer Jan have? So let's think about this. So let's say that the number of acres of broccoli crops, let's call that B, and let's say the acres of spinach crops, acres of spinach crops, let's call that S. So how much broccoli is he going to grow in, I guess you could say, last year? Last year, how much broccoli did he grow? And let me just write this down. This is last year. Last year."
Math,"And they tell us, last year he grew six tons of broccoli per acre. So if he grew six tons of broccoli per acre, and he has B acres, well, that means he grew six tons per acre times B acres. So he grew 6B tons of broccoli last year. And by the same logic, he grew how much spinach? Well, nine tons of spinach per acre times S acres. So 9S tons of spinach, and then the total is 93 tons, so for a total of 93 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 93. So now let's think about this year."
Math,"And in general, when you tackle these, just think about, well, set the variables in general to what they're asking for, and then, how can you use the information that they're giving us? So this year, how much broccoli would he have grown? Well, he grew two tons of broccoli per acre, so he grew two tons per acre. He has the same number of acres. We can assume that. So two tons per acre times B acres is gonna be 2B tons of broccoli."
Math,"And by that same logic, it's going to be, he grew three tons of spinach per acre. Well, he has S acres. Each of those acres, he's growing three tons of spinach per acre, so it's going to be 3S tons of spinach. And they tell us what that total is. That total is, for a total of 31 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 31. And so now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, that we can use to solve for B and S. So let's see."
Math,"What do we wanna solve for first? Well, what we could do, let me rewrite the top equation. So we have 6B plus, plus 9S is equal to 93, is equal to 93. And the second equation, we'll let's try to eliminate the Bs. So let's multiply the second equation by negative three. I'm gonna multiply the left hand side by negative three, and I'm gonna multiply the right hand side by negative three. What am I going to get? Negative three times 2B is negative 6B."
Math,"That was the whole point by multiplying it by negative three. Negative three times 3S is negative 9S, negative 9S. And then, negative three times 31 is going to be negative 93. So what do we get if we now add the two sides of these equations? So on the left hand side, 6B minus 6B, that's zero. 9S minus 9S, that's zero. We're gonna get just zero. On the right hand side we get 93 minus 93. Well, that's still just going to be zero."
Math,"So we have this situation where we get zero equals zero, which is going to be true no matter what X and Y are, and so this is a system with an infinite number of solutions. So this has infinite, infinite number of solutions. So one way we could think about it is, these two constraints, they're not giving us enough information. There's an infinite number of B and S combinations that would satisfy these equations, so they're not giving us enough information to say exactly what B and S are."
Math,"So there is not enough, not enough info! Put an exclamation mark there.."
Math,"Let's let n equal the number of nickels. Maybe I'll write ""let"" here. Let's let q be equal to the number of quarters. So how many total coins do we have? We'', it's going to be the number of nickels plus the number of quarters. So we have the nickels plus the quarters need to be equal to-- well, it tells us we have 16 total coins. So if we add up the total number of nickels plus the number of quarters, we have 16 coins. So that's one equation right there."
Math,"And then how much total money do we have? Well, however many nickels we have, we can multiply that times 0.05, and that'll tell us how much money we have in nickels. So 0.05 times the nickels plus the amount of money we have in quarters. Well, that'll just be $0.25 per quarter, or 0.25 of $1. So let me write 0.25 times the number of quarters. For example, if I had 4 quarters and no nickels, I'd have 4 times $0.25 which is $1. And no money due to nickels."
Math,"So it's however may nickels times $0.05 plus however many quarters times $0.25. That's the total amount of money I have. And her piggy bank tells me that is $2.00. That is equal to $2.00. So we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for n and q. And let's do it by substitution. So the easiest thing that we could do here, let's solve for q over here. So if n plus q is equal to 16, we could subtract n from both sides of this equation."
Math,"So if n plus q is equal to 16, if we subtract n from both sides, we get q is equal to 16 minus n. So all I did is I rewrote this first constraint right over there. So since this first constraint is telling us that q, the number of quarters, must be 16 minus the number of nickels, in the second constraint, every place that we see a q, every place we see quarters, we can replace it with 16 minus n. So let's do that. So the second constraint when we make the substitution becomes 0.05n plus 0.25."
Math,"Instead of q, I'm going to write 16 minus n. That's what the first constraint tells us. q must be 16 minus n. That is going to be equal to $2.00. We're solving this system by substitution. Now let's see if I can simplify this. So we have 0.05n plus-- let's distribute the 0.25 times the 16 and the 0.25 times the negative n. 0.25 times 16, that's the same thing as 1/4 times 16. That's just going to be 4. And then 0.25 times negative n is minus 0.25n. And that is going to be equal to $2.00."
Math,"Let me scroll down a little bit. I'll scroll down a little bit. See we have 0.05n minus 0.25n. So if I have 0.05 minus 0.25, let me combine these terms. So if I have 0.05 of something, and I'm going to subtract from that 0.25 of that something, that'll give me negative 0.20 of that something. If I combine these two terms, I get negative 0.20 or negative And then of course, I have the plus 4. Plus 4 is equal to $2.00, or we could even just write 2 there."
Math,"Now, we can isolate the n on the left-hand side by subtracting 4 from both sides. So let's subtract 4 from both sides. And we are left with, on the left-hand side, negative-- I could just write that is negative 0.20n is equal to 2 minus 4 is negative 2. And then we could divide both sides by negative 0.2. Or I could write negative 0.20, the same thing. We're not going to go too deep into the significance in all We're assuming that we have infinite precision on everything."
Math,"So negative 2 divided by negative 0.2, these guys cancel out, and we are left with n is equal to-- the negatives cancel out. 2 divided by 0.2 is just going to be 10. n is equal to 10. And then we know that q is equal to 16 minus n from the first constraint. q is equal to 16 minus n, which is 10, which is going to be 6. So Zoey put in 10 nickels. I want to do that in a different color. She put in 10 nickels and 6 quarters in the bank. And we can verify it. So clearly she has 16 coins."
Math,"So that part makes sense. 10 nickels, 6 quarters, that's 16 coins. That makes sense. And we could also verify that it's the right amount of money. 10 nickels are going to be $0.50, 10 times $0.05 each. So it's going to be $0.50. And then 6 quarters is going to be $1.50. So it's going to be $1.50. So the total amount of money she has is $0.50 plus $1.50 which is $2.00. So it all works out.."
Math,"And let's say we have this other line over here. We'll call this line CD. So it goes through point C and it goes through point D. And it just keeps on going forever. And let's say that these lines both sit on the same plane. And in this case, the plane is our screen, or this little piece of paper that we're looking at right over here. And they never intersect. So they're on the same plane, but they never intersect each other."
Math,"If those two things are true, and when they're not the same line, they never intersect and they can be on the same plane, then we say that these lines are parallel. They're moving in the same general direction, in fact, the exact same general direction. If we were looking at it from an algebraic point of view, we would say that they have the same slope, but they have different y-intercepts. They involve different points."
Math,"If we drew our coordinate axes here, they would intersect that at a different point, but they would have the same exact slope. And what I want to do is think about how angles relate to parallel lines. So right over here, we have these two parallel lines. We can say that line AB is parallel to line CD. Sometimes you'll see it specified on geometric drawings like this. They'll put a little arrow here to show that these two lines are parallel."
Math,"And if you've already used the single arrow, they might put a double arrow to show that this line is parallel to that line right over there. Now with that out of the way, what I want to do is draw a line that intersects both of these parallel lines. So here's a line that intersects both of them. Let me draw a little bit neater than that. So let me draw that line right over there. Well, actually, I'll do some points over here. Well, I'll just call that line l."
Math,"And this line that intersects both of these parallel lines, we call that a transversal. This is a transversal line. It is transversing both of these parallel lines. This is a transversal. And what I want to think about is the angles that are formed, and how they relate to each other. The angles that are formed at the intersection between this transversal line and the two parallel lines. So we could, first of all, start off with this angle right over here."
Math,"And we could call that angle-- well, if we made some labels here, that would be D, this point, and then something else. But I'll just call it this angle right over here. We know that that's going to be equal to its vertical angles. So this angle is vertical with that one. So it's going to be equal to that angle right over there. We also know that this angle, right over here, is going to be equal to its vertical angle, or the angle that is opposite the intersection. So it's going to be equal to that."
Math,"And sometimes you'll see it specified like this, where you'll see a double angle mark like that. Or sometimes you'll see someone write this to show that these two are equal and these two are equal right over here. Now the other thing we know is we could do the exact same exercise up here, that these two are going to be equal to each other and these two are going to be equal to each other. They're all vertical angles."
Math,"What's interesting here is thinking about the relationship between that angle right over there, and this angle right up over here. And if you just look at it, it is actually obvious what that relationship is-- that they are going to be the same exact angle, that if you put a protractor here and measured it, you would get the exact same measure up here. And if I drew parallel lines-- maybe I'll draw it straight left and right, it might be a little bit more obvious."
Math,"So if I assume that these two lines are parallel, and I have a transversal here, what I'm saying is that this angle is going to be the exact same measure as that angle there. And to visualize that, just imagine tilting this line. And as you take different-- so it looks like it's the case over there. If you take the line like this and you look at it over here, it's clear that this is equal to this. And there's actually no proof for this."
Math,"This is one of those things that a mathematician would say is intuitively obvious, that if you look at it, as you tilt this line, you would say that these angles are the same. Or think about putting a protractor here to actually measure these angles. If you put a protractor here, you'd have one side of the angle at the zero degree, and the other side would specify that point. And if you put the protractor over here, the exact same thing would happen."
Math,"One side would be on this parallel line, and the other side would point at the exact same point. So given that, we know that not only is this side equivalent to this side, it is also equivalent to this side over here. And that tells us that that's also equivalent to that side over there. So all of these things in green are equivalent. And by the same exact argument, this angle is going to have the same measure as this angle."
Math,"And that's going to be the same as this angle, because they are opposite, or they're vertical angles. Now the important thing to realize is just what we've deduced here. The vertical angles are equal and the corresponding angles at the same points of intersection are also equal. And so that's a new word that I'm introducing right over here. This angle and this angle are corresponding. They represent kind of the top right corner, in this example, of where we intersected."
Math,"Here they represent still, I guess, the top or the top right corner of the intersection. This would be the top left corner. They're always going to be equal, corresponding angles. And once again, really, it's, I guess, for lack of a better word, it is a bit obvious. Now on top of that, there are other words that people will see. We've essentially just proven that not only is this angle equivalent to this angle, but it's also equivalent to this angle right over here."
Math,"And these two angles-- let me label them so that we can make some headway here. So I'm going to use lowercase letters for the angles themselves. So let's call this lowercase a, lowercase b, lowercase c. So lowercase c for the angle, lowercase d, and then let me call this e, f, g, h. So we know from vertical angles that b is equal to c. But we also know that b is equal to f because they are corresponding angles. And that f is equal to g."
Math,"So vertical angles are equivalent, corresponding angles are equivalent, and so we also know, obviously, that b is equal to g. And so we say that alternate interior angles are equivalent. So you see that they're kind of on the interior of the intersection. They're between the two lines, but they're on all opposite sides of the transversal. Now you don't have to know that fancy word, alternate interior angles, you really just have to deduce what we just saw over here."
Math,"Know that vertical angles are going to be equal and corresponding angles are going to be equal. And you see it with the other ones, too. We know that a is going to be equal to d, which is going to be equal to h, which is going to be equal to e.."
Math,"They're in the plane of the screen you're viewing right now. But they are two lines that are in the same plane that never intersect. And one way to verify, because you can sometimes-- it looks like two lines won't intersect, but you can't just always assume based on how it looks. You really have to have some information given in the diagram or the problem that tells you that they are definitely parallel, that they're definitely never going to intersect."
Math,"And one of those pieces of information which they give right over here is that they show that line ST and line UV, they both intersect line CD at the exact same angle, at this angle right here. And in particular, it's at a right angle. And if you have two lines that intersect a third line at the same angle-- so these are actually called corresponding angles and they're the same-- if you have two of these corresponding angles the same, then these two lines are parallel. So line ST is parallel to line UV."
Math,"And we can write it like this. Line ST, we put the arrows on each end of that top bar to say that this is a line, not just a line segment. Line ST is parallel to line UV. And I think that's the only set of parallel lines in this diagram. Now let's think about perpendicular lines. Perpendicular lines are lines that intersect at a 90-degree angle. So, for example, line ST is perpendicular to line CD. So line ST is perpendicular to line CD."
Math,"And we know that they intersect at a right angle or at a 90-degree angle because they gave us this little box here which literally means that the measure of this angle is 90 degrees. By the exact same argument, line the UV is perpendicular to CD. Let me make sure I specified these as lines. Line UV is perpendicular to CD. So I did UV, ST, they're perpendicular to CD."
Math,"And then after that, the only other information where they definitely tell us that two lines are intersecting at right angles are line AB and WX. So AB is definitely perpendicular to WX, line WX. And I think we are done. And one thing to think about, AB and CD, well, they don't even intersect in this diagram. So you can't make any comment about perpendicular, but they're definitely not parallel. You could even imagine that it looks like they're about to intersect."
Math,"And they give us no information that they intersect the same lines at the same angle. So if somehow they told us that this is a right angle, even though it doesn't look anything like a right angle, then we would have to suspend our judgment based on how it actually looks and say, oh, I guess maybe those things are perpendicular, or maybe these two things are parallel. But they didn't tell us that. And that would actually be bizarre because it looks so not parallel."
Math,"And actually then this would end up being parallel to other things as well if that was done. It's a good thing that wasn't because it would look very strange. But based on the information they gave us, these are the parallel and the perpendicular lines.."
Math,"So these two lines are parallel. This is the symbol right over here to show that these two lines are parallel. And then let me draw a transversal here. So let me draw a transversal. This is also a line. Now, let's say that we know that this angle right over here is 110 degrees. What other angles can we figure out here? Well, the first thing that we might realize is that, look, corresponding angles are equivalent."
Math,"This angle, the angle between this parallel line and the transversal, is going to be the same as the angle between this parallel line and the transversal. So this right over here is also going to be 110 degrees. Now, we also know that vertical angles are equivalent. So if this is 110 degrees, then this angle right over here on the opposite side of the intersection is also going to be 110 degrees."
Math,"And we could use that same logic right over here to say that if this is 110 degrees, then this is also 110 degrees. We could've also said that, look, this angle right over here corresponds to this angle right over here so that they also will have to be the same. Now, what about these other angles? So this angle right over here, its outside ray, I guess you could say, forms a line with this angle right over here. This pink angle is supplementary to this 110 degree angle."
Math,"So this pink angle plus 110 is going to be equal to 180. Or we know that this pink angle is going to be 70 degrees. And then we know that it's a vertical angle with this angle right over here, so this is also 70 degrees. This angle that's kind of right below this parallel line with the transversal, the bottom left, I guess you could say, corresponds to this bottom left angle right over here. So this is also 70 degrees."
Math,"And we could've also figured that out by saying, hey, this angle is supplementary to this angle right over here. And then we could use multiple arguments. The vertical angle argument, the supplementary argument two ways, or the corresponding angle argument to say that, hey, this must be 70 degrees as well.."
Math,"These are parallel lines. Actually, I can do that a little bit neater. And let me draw a transversal, so a line that intersects both of these parallel lines, so something like that. And now let's say that we are told that this angle right over here is 9x plus 88. And this is in degrees. And we're also told that this angle right over here is 6x plus 182, once again, in degrees."
Math,"So my goal here and my question for you is, can we figure out what these angles actually are, given that these are parallel lines and this is a transversal line? And I encourage you to pause this video to try this on your own. Well, the key here to realize is that these right over here are related by the fact that they're formed from a transversal intersecting parallel lines. And we know, for example, that this angle corresponds to this angle right over here. They're going to be congruent angles."
Math,"And so this is 6x plus 182. This is also going to be 6x plus 182. And then that helps us realize that this blue angle and this orange angle are actually going to be supplementary. They're going to add up to 180 degrees, because put together, when you make them adjacent, their outer rays form a line right over here. So we know that 6x plus 182 plus 9x plus 88 is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And now we just have to simplify this thing. So 6x plus 9x is going to give us 15x. And then we have 182 plus 88."
Math,"Let's see, 182 plus 8, would get us to 190. And then we add another 80. It gets us to 270-- plus 270-- is equal to 180. If we subtract 270 from both sides, we get 15x is equal to negative 90. And now we can divide both sides by 15. And we get x is equal to-- what is this? Let's see, 6 times 15 is 60 plus 30 is 90. So x is going to be equal to negative 6. So far, we've made a lot of progress. We figured out what x is equal to."
Math,"x is equal to negative 6, but we still haven't figured out what these angles are equal to. So this angle right over here, 9x plus 88, this is going to be equal to 9 times negative 6 plus 88. 9 times negative 6 is negative 54. Let me write this down before I make a mistake. Negative 54 plus 88 is going to be-- let's see, to go from 88 minus 54 will give us 34 degrees. So this is equal to 34, and it's in degrees. So this orange angle right here is 34 degrees. The blue angle is going to be 180 minus that."
Math,"But we can verify that by actually evaluating 6x plus So this is going to be equal to 6 times negative 6 is negative 36 plus 182. So this is going to be equal to-- let's see, if I subtract the 6 first, I get to 176. So this gets us to 146 degrees. And you can verify-- 146 plus 34 is equal to 180 degrees. Now, we could also figure out the other angles from this as well. We know that if this is 34 degrees, then this must be 34 degrees as well. Those are opposite angles."
Math,"This angle also corresponds to this angle so it must also be 34 degrees, which is opposite to this angle, which is going to be 34 degrees. Similarly, if this one right over here is 146 degrees, we already know that this one is going to be 146. This one's going to be 146 since it's opposite. And that's going to be 146 degrees as well.."
Math,"This one's y. This one is z. And what I want to prove is that the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle, that x plus y plus z is equal to 180 degrees. And the way that I'm going to do it is using our knowledge of parallel lines, or transversals of parallel lines, and corresponding angles. And to do that, I'm going to extend each of these sides of the triangle, which right now are line segments, but extend them into lines."
Math,"So this side down here, if I keep going on and on forever in the same directions, then now all of a sudden I have an orange line. And what I want to do is construct another line that is parallel to the orange line that goes through this vertex of the triangle right over here. And I can always do that. I could just start from this point, and go in the same direction as this line, and I will never intersect. I'm not getting any closer or further away from that line. So I'm never going to intersect that line."
Math,"So these two lines right over here are parallel. This is parallel to that. Now I'm going to go to the other two sides of my original triangle and extend them into lines. So I'm going to extend this one into a line. So, do that as neatly as I can. So I'm going to extend that into a line. And you see that this is clearly a transversal of these two parallel lines. Now if we have a transversal here of two parallel lines, then we must have some corresponding angles."
Math,"And we see that this angle is formed when the transversal intersects the bottom orange line. Well what's the corresponding angle when the transversal intersects this top blue line? What's the angle on the top right of the intersection? Angle on the top right of the intersection must also be x. The other thing that pops out at you, is there's another vertical angle with x, another angle that must be equivalent. On the opposite side of this intersection, you have this angle right over here."
Math,"These two angles are vertical. So if this has measure x, then this one must have measure x as well. Let's do the same thing with the last side of the triangle that we have not extended into a line yet. So let's do that. So if we take this one. So we just keep going. So it becomes a line. So now it becomes a transversal of the two parallel lines just like the magenta line did."
Math,"And we say, hey look this angle y right over here, this angle is formed from the intersection of the transversal on the bottom parallel line. What angle to correspond to up here? Well this is kind of on the left side of the intersection. It corresponds to this angle right over here, where the green line, the green transversal intersects the blue parallel line. Well what angle is vertical to it? Well, this angle. So this is going to have measure y as well."
Math,"So now we're really at the home stretch of our proof because we will see that the measure-- we have this angle and this angle. This has measure angle x. This has measure z. They're both adjacent angles. If we take the two outer rays that form the angle, and we think about this angle right over here, what's this measure of this wide angle right over there? Well, it's going to be x plus z. And that angle is supplementary to this angle right over here that has measure y."
Math,"So the measure of x-- the measure of this wide angle, which is x plus z, plus the measure of this magenta angle, which is y, must be equal to 180 degrees because these two angles are supplementary. So x-- so the measure of the wide angle, x plus z, plus the measure of the magenta angle, which is supplementary to the wide angle, it must be equal to 180 degrees because they are supplementary. Well we could just reorder this if we want to put in alphabetical order. But we've just completed our proof."
Math,"The measure of the interior angles of the triangle, x plus z plus y. We could write this as x plus y plus z if the lack of alphabetical order is making you uncomfortable. We could just rewrite this as x plus y plus z is equal to 180 degrees. And we are done.."
Math,"And we know that side AB or segment AB is equal to segment BC, which is equal to segment CD. Or we could also call that DC. So first of all, we see that triangle ABC is isosceles. And because it's isosceles, the two base angles are going to be congruent. This is one leg. This is the other leg right over there. So the two base angles are going to be congruent. So we know that this angle right over here is also 31 degrees."
Math,"Well, if we know two of the angles in a triangle, we can always figure out the third angle. They have to add up to 180 degrees. So we could say 31 degrees plus 31 degrees plus the measure of angle ABC is equal to 180 degrees. You can subtract 62. This right here is 62 degrees. You subtract 62 from both sides. You get the measure of angle ABC is equal to-- let's see. 180 minus 60 would be 120. You subtract another 2. You get 118 degrees. So this angle right over here is 118 degrees."
Math,"Let me just write it like this. This is 118 degrees. Well, this angle right over here is supplementary to that 118 degrees. So that angle plus 118 is going to be equal to 180. We already know that that's 62 degrees. 62 plus 118 is 180. So this right over here is 62 degrees. Now, this angle is one of the base angles for triangle BCD. I didn't draw it that way, but this side and this side are congruent. BC has the same length as CD. Those are the two legs of an isosceles triangle."
Math,"You can kind of imagine it was turned upside down. This is the vertex. This is one base angle. This is the other base angle. Well, the base angles are going to be congruent. So this is going to be 62 degrees, as well. And then finally, if you want to figure out this blue angle, the blue angle plus these two 62-degree angles are going to have to add up to 180 degrees. So you get 62 plus 62 plus the blue angle, which is the measure of angle BCD, is going to have to be equal to 180 degrees."
Math,"These two characters-- let's see. 62 plus 62 is 124. You subtract 124 from both sides. You get the measure of angle BCD is equal to-- let's see. If you subtract 120, you get 60, and then you have to subtract another 4. So you get 56 degrees. So this is equal to 56 degrees. And we're done. Now, we could do either of these. Let's do this one right over here. So what is the measure of angle ABE? So they haven't even drawn segment BE here. So let me draw that for us."
Math,"And so we have to figure out the measure of angle ABE. So we have a bunch of congruent segments here. And in particular, we see that triangle ABD, all of its sides are equal. So it's an equilateral triangle, which means all of the angles are equal. And if all of the angles are equal in a triangle, they all have to be 60 degrees. So all of these characters are going to be 60 degrees. Well, that's part of angle ABE, but we have to figure out this other part right over here."
Math,"And to do that, we can see that we're actually dealing with an isosceles triangle kind of tipped over to the left. This is the vertex angle. This is one base angle. This is the other base angle. And the vertex angle right here is 90 degrees. And once again, we know it's isosceles because this side, segment BD, is equal to segment DE. And once again, these two angles plus this angle right over here are going to have to add up to 180 degrees. So you call that an x. You call that an x."
Math,"You've got x plus x plus 90 is going to be 180 degrees. So you get 2x plus-- let me just write it out. Don't want to skip steps here. We have x plus x plus 90 is going to be equal to 180 degrees. x plus x is the same thing as 2x, plus 90 is equal to 180. And then we can subtract 90 from both sides. You get 2x is equal to 90. Or divide both sides by 2. You get x is equal to 45 degrees. And then we're done because angle ABE is going to be equal to the 60 degrees plus the 45 degrees."
Math,"So it's going to be this whole angle, which is what we care about. Angle ABE is going to be 60 plus 45, which is 105 degrees. And now we have this last problem over here. This one looks a little bit simpler. I have an isosceles triangle. This leg is equal to that leg. This is the vertex angle. I have to figure out B."
Math,"And the trick here is like, wait, how do I figure out one side of a triangle if I only know one other side? Don't I need to know two other sides? And we'll do it the exact same way we just did that second part of that problem. If this is an isosceles triangle, which we know it is, then this angle is going to be equal to that angle there. And so if we call this x, then this is x as well. And we get x plus x plus 36 degrees is equal to 180. The two x's, when you add them up, you get 2x."
Math,"And then-- I won't skip steps here. 2x plus 36 is equal to 180. Subtract 36 from both sides, we get 2x-- that 2 looks a little bit funny. We get 2x is equal to-- 180 minus 30 is 150. And then you want to subtract another 6 from 150, gets us to 144. Did I do that right? 180 minus 30 is 150, yep, 144. Divide both sides by 2. You get x is equal to 72 degrees. So this is equal to 72 degrees. And we are done.."
Math,"I have another triangle over here. We were given some of the angles inside of these triangles. Given the information over here, I want to figure out what the measure of this angle is right over there. I need to figure out what that question mark is. And so you might want to give a go at it just knowing what you know about the sums of the measures of the angles inside of a triangle, and maybe a little bit of what you know about supplementary angles."
Math,"So you might want to pause it and give it a try yourself because I'm about to give you the solution. So the first thing you might say-- and this is a general way to think about a lot of these problems where they give you some angles and you have to figure out some other angles based on the sum of angles and a triangle equaling 180, or this one doesn't have parallel lines on it."
Math,"But you might see some with parallel lines and supplementary lines and complementary lines-- is to just fill in everything that you can figure out, and one way or another, you probably would be able to figure out what this question mark is. So the first thing that kind of pops out to me is we have one triangle right over here. We have this triangle on the left. And on this triangle on the left, we're given 2 of the angles."
Math,"And if you have 2 of the angles in a triangle, you can always figure out the third angle because they're going to add up to 180 degrees. So if you call that x, we know that x plus 50 plus 64 is going to be equal to 180 degrees. Or we could say, x plus, what is this, 114. X plus 114 is equal to 180 degrees. We could subtract 114 from both sides of this equation, and we get x is equal to 180 minus 114. So 80 minus 14. 80 minus 10 would be 70, minus another 4 is 66. So x is 66 degrees."
Math,"Now, if x is 66 degrees, I think you might find that there's another angle that's not too hard to figure out. So let me write it like this. Let me write x is equal to 66 degrees. Well if we know this angle right over here, if we know the measure of this angle is 66 degrees, we know that that angle is supplementary with this angle right over here. Their outer sides form a straight angle, and they are adjacent."
Math,"So if we call this angle right over here, y, we know that y plus x is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And we know x is equal to 66 degrees. So this is 66. And so we can subtract 66 from both sides, and we get y is equal to-- these cancel out-- 180 minus 66 is 114. And that number might look a little familiar to you. Notice, this 114 was the exact same sum of these 2 angles over here. And that's actually a general idea, and I'll do it on the side here just to prove it to you."
Math,"If I have, let's say that these 2 angles-- let's say that the measure of that angle is a, the measure of that angle is b, the measure of this angle we know is going to be 180 minus a minus b. That's this angle right over here. And then this angle, which is considered to be an exterior angle. So in this example, y is an exterior angle. In this example, that is our exterior angle. That is going to be supplementary to 180 minus a minus b. So this angle plus 180 minus a minus b is going to be equal to 180."
Math,"So if you call this angle y, you would have y plus 180 minus a minus b is equal to 180. You could subtract 180 from both sides. You could add a plus b to both sides. So plus a plus b. Running out of space on the right hand side. And then you're left with-- these cancel out. On the left hand side, you're left with y. On the right hand side is equal to a plus b. So this is just a general property."
Math,"You can just reason it through yourself just with the sum of the measures of the angles inside of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, and then you have a supplementary angles right over here. Or you could just say, look, if I have the exterior angles right over here, it's equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. That's just a little terminology you could see there. So y is equal to a plus b. 114 degrees, we've already shown to ourselves, is equal to 64 plus 50 degrees."
Math,"But anyway, regardless of how we do it, if we just reason it out step by step or if we just knew this property from the get go, if we know that y is equal to 114 degrees-- and I like to reason it out every time just to make sure I'm not jumping to conclusions. So if y is 114 degrees, now we know this angle. We were given this angle in the beginning. Now we just have to figure out this third angle in this triangle."
Math,"So if we call this z, if we call this question mark is equal to z, we know that z plus 114 plus 31 is equal to 180 degrees. The sums of the measures of the angle inside of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. That's the only property we're using in this step. So we get z plus, what is this, 145 is equal to 180. Did I do that right? We have a 15, then a 30. Yep, 145 is equal to 180. Subtract 145 from both sides of this equation, and we are left with z is equal to 80 minus 45 is equal to 35."
Math,"So z is equal to 35 degrees, and we are done.."
Math,And we're going to call that measure x. And so I encourage you to pause the video right now and try it yourself. And then I'm going to give you the solution. So I'm assuming you've unpaused it. And you've solved it or you've given it at least a good shot of it. So let's try to do it. And what's fun about these is there's multiple ways to solve these. And you kind of just have to keep figuring out what you can figure out. So let's say you start on the left-hand side right over here.
Math,"If this is 121 degrees, then you'd say, well look, this angle right over here is supplementary to this angle right over there. So this is 121 degrees plus this green angle, that has to be equal to 180 degrees. So this is going to be 180 minus 121. Let's see, that's the same thing as 80 minus 21. 80 minus 20 would be 60. So that's going to be 59 degrees. So let me write that down. That's going to be 59 degrees. Now we see that we have two angles of a triangle."
Math,"If you have two angles of a triangle, you can figure out the third angle, because they need to add up to 180. Or you could say that this angle right over here-- so we'll call that question mark-- we know that 59 plus 29 plus question mark needs to be equal to 180 degrees. And if we subtract the 15 out of the 29 from both sides, we get question mark is equal to 180 minus 59 minus 29 degrees. So that is going to be 180 minus 59 minus 29, let's see, 180 minus 59, we already know, is 121."
Math,"And then 121 minus 29. So if you subtract just 20, you get 101. You subtract another 9, you get 92. So that's going to be equal to 92 degrees. This is equal to 92 degrees. Well, this right here is equal to 92 degrees. This angle right here is vertical with that angle. So it is also going to be equal to 92 degrees. And now we're getting pretty close. We can zoom in on this triangle down here. And let me save some space here. So let me just say that that over there is also going to be 92 degrees."
Math,"And at this triangle down here, we have two of the sides of the triangle. We just have to figure out the third. And actually, we don't even have to do much math here, because we have two of the angles of this triangle. We have to figure out the third angle. So over here, we have one angle that's 92, one angle that's 29. The other one will be 180 minus 92 minus 29. And we don't even have to do any math here, because essentially, this is the exact same angles that we have in this triangle right over here."
Math,"We have a 92 degree angle, we have a 29 degree angle, and the other one is 59 degrees. So in this case, it has to be also 59 degrees, because over here they added up to 180. So over here, they'll also add up to 180. So that will also get us to 59 degrees. We could just get that by taking 180, subtracting 29, subtracting 92. And then if this is 59 degrees, then this angle is also going to be 59 degrees, because they are vertical angles. So we're done. x is equal to 59 degrees."
Math,"Now there's multiple ways that you could have reasoned through this problem. You could have immediately said-- so let me start over, actually. Maybe a faster way, but you wouldn't have been able to do kind of this basic steps there, is you said, look, this is an exterior angle right over here. It is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. So 121 is going to be 29 plus this thing right over here. And we ended up doing that when I did it step-by-step before."
Math,"But here, we're just using kind of a few things that we know about triangles ahead of time to maybe skip a step or two. Although I like to do it the other way just so we make sure we don't do anything weird. So anyway, this is going to be 129 minus 29, which is going to be 92. And if this is 92, then this is also going to be 92. And then, if this is x, then this is also going to be x. And you could say x plus 92 plus 29 is equal to 180 degrees."
Math,And then you'd say x plus 92 plus 29 is going to be 121 degrees. We already knew that before. And so that is going to equal 180 degrees. And so x is equal to 59 degrees. So there's a ton of ways that you could have thought about this problem..
Math,"And we'll call that measure theta. And they tell us a few other things. You might have seen this symbol before. That means that these are right angles or that they have a measure of 90 degrees. So that's a 90-degree angle, that is a 90-degree angle, and that is a 90-degree angle over there. And they also tell us that this angle over here is 32 degrees. So let's see what we can do. And maybe we can solve this in multiple different ways."
Math,"That's what's really fun about these is there's multiple ways to solve these problems. So if this angle is theta, we have theta is adjacent to this green angle. And if you add them together, you're going to get this right angle. So this pink angle, theta, plus this green angle must be equal to 90 degrees. When you combine them, you get a right angle. So you could call this one-- its measure is going to be 90 minus beta. And now we have three angles in the triangle, and we just have to solve for theta."
Math,Because we know this angle plus this angle plus this angle are going to be equal to 180 degrees. So you have 90 minus theta plus 90 degrees plus 32 degrees-- so I'm going to do that in a different color-- is going to be equal to 180 degrees. The sum of the measures of the angle inside of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. That's all we're doing over here. And so let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.
Math,"So these two guys-- 90 plus 90's going to be 180, so you get 180 minus theta plus 32 is equal to 180 degrees. And then what else do we have? We have 180 on both sides. We can subtract that from both sides. So that cancels out. That goes to 0. And then you have negative theta plus 32 degrees is equal to 0. You can add theta to both sides. And you get 32 degrees is equal to theta, or theta is equal to 32 degrees. So it's going to actually be the same measure as this angle right over here."
Math,"That's one way to do the problem. There's other ways that we could have done the problem. Actually, there's a ton of ways we could have done this. We could have looked at this big triangle over here. And we could've said, look. If this is 90 degrees over here, this is 32 degrees over here, this angle up here is going to be 180 minus 90 degrees minus 32 degrees. Because they all have to add up to 180 degrees. And I just kind of skipped a step there. Actually, let me not skip a step. Let me call this x."
Math,"If we call the measure of that angle x, we would have x plus 90. I'm looking at the biggest triangle in this diagram right here. x plus 90 plus 32 is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And so if you subtract 90 and 32 from both sides. So if you subtract 90 from both sides, you get x plus 32 is equal to 90. And then if you subtract 32 from both sides, you get x is equal to-- what is this-- 58 degrees. Fair enough."
Math,"Now, what else can we figure out? Well, if this angle over here is a right angle-- and I'm just redoing the problem over again just to show you that there's multiple ways to get the answer. We were given that this is a right angle. If that is 90 degrees, then this angle over here is supplementary to it, and it also has to be 90 degrees. So then we have this angle plus 90 degrees plus this angle have to equal 180. Maybe we could call that y. So y plus 58 plus 90 is equal to 180."
Math,"You can subtract 90 from both sides. Subtract 90 from both sides. This will become 90. Subtract 58 from both sides, you get y is equal to 32 degrees. Well, if y is 32 degrees, it is complementary. It is complementary to this angle right over here. It is complementary-- let me do that in a new color, not supplementary. It is complementary. It adds up to 90 degrees. It is complementary to this angle over here. We could call it z."
Math,"So these two combined are going to add up to 90 degrees, or z is going to be equal to 58 degrees. And now we're inside the triangle that we care about to figure out theta, theta that we've already figured out earlier in this video. Well, this z is 58 degrees. If this angle over here is 90, then this one over here is also going to be 90, because they're supplementary. So you have 58 degrees. I wanted to do that in that orange color."
Math,"So if you have 58 degrees, so you have 58 plus this 90, plus 90, plus theta now is going to be equal to 180 degrees. You can subtract 90 from both sides. That becomes 90, and then you have 58 plus theta is equal to 90. Subtract 58 from both sides. You get theta is equal to 32 degrees again. And so we've got the same answer. I just wanted to do that, show you that there are multiple ways to do these problems."
Math,"And as long as you're doing things that are logically consistent, you're making assumptions that you can make and then logically deducing step by step, there's multiple ways to get that right answer.."
Math,"It's an irregular pentagon. Not all the sides look to be the same length. And the sides are kind of continued on. And we have these particular exterior angles of this pentagon. And what we're asked is, what is the sum of all of these exterior angles. And it's kind of daunting, because they don't give us any other information. They don't even give us any particular angles. They don't start us off anywhere. And so what we can do, let's just think about the step by step, just based on what we do know."
Math,"Well, we have these exterior angles. And these exterior angles, they're each supplementary to some interior angle. So maybe if we can express them as a function of the interior angles, we can maybe write this problem in a way that seems a little bit more doable. So let's write the interior angles over here. We already got to e. So let's call this f, this interior angle f. Let's call this interior angle g. Let's call this interior angle h. Let's call this one i. And let's call this one j."
Math,"And so this sum of these particular exterior angles, a is now the same thing as 180 minus g, because a and g are supplementary. So a is 180 minus g. And then we have plus b. But b we can write in terms of this interior angle. It's going to be 180 minus h, because these two angles once again, are supplementary. We do that in a new color. So this is going to be 180 minus h. And we could do the same thing for each of them. c, we can write as 180 minus i, so plus 180 minus i."
Math,"And then d, we can write as 180 minus j, so plus 180 minus j. And then finally, e, I'm running out of colors, e, we can write as 180 minus f, so plus 180 minus f. And so, what we're left with, if we add up all the 180s, we have 180 5 times. So this is going to be equal to 5 times 180 which is what, 900. And then you have minus g, minus h, minus i, minus j, minus f."
Math,"Or we could write that as minus-- I'll try to do the same colors-- g plus h-- I'm kind of factoring out this negative sign-- g plus h-- I'll do the same color as g, that's not the same color-- g plus h, plus i, plus j, plus f. And the whole reason why did this and why this is interesting now, is that we've expressed this first thing that we need to figure out. We've expressed it in terms of sum of the interior angles. So it's going to be 900 minus all of this business."
Math,"So this is 900 minus all of this business, which is the sum of the interior angles. So this is the sum of the interior angles. So it seems like we've made a little progress, at least if we can figure out the sum of the interior angles. And to do that part, I'll show you a little trick. What you want to do is divide this polygon, the inside of the polygon, into three non-overlapping triangles. And so we could do that from any side. Let's say that they're all coming out of that side right over there."
Math,"So there. I have divide it-- let me do this in a neutral color, I'm doing it in white-- so that's one triangle right over here. And then let me make another triangle just like that. So there you go. I've divided into three non-overlapping triangles. And the reason why I did that, the reason why this is valuable, is we know what the sum of the angles of a triangle add up to."
Math,"And so to make that useful, we have to express these angles in terms of angles that we can figure out based on the fact that the sums of the angles, or the measures of the angles in a triangle add up to 180. So g is kind of already one of the angles in the triangle. F is made up of two angles in the triangle. So remember, f is this entire angle right over here. So let's divide f into two other angles, or two other measures of angles, I should say."
Math,"So let's say that f is equal to-- we've already gone as high as, let's see, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j-- we haven't used k yet. So let's say that f is equal to k plus l. It's equal to the sum of the measures of these two adjacent angles right over here. So f is equal to k plus l. So that way we've split it up into angles of these other triangles. And then we can do that with j as well, because j, once again, is that whole thing. So we could that j is equal to-- let's see, we already used l."
Math,"So let's say j is equal to m plus n. And then finally, we can split up h. h is up here. Remember, it's this whole thing. Let's say that h is the same thing as o plus p plus q. This is o, this is p, this is q. And once again, I wanted to split up these interior angles if they're not already an angle of a triangle. I want to split them up into angles that are parts of these triangles. So we have h is equal to o, plus p, plus q."
Math,"And the reason why that's interesting is now we can write the sum of these interior angles as the sum of a bunch of angles that are part of these triangles. And then we can use the fact that, for any one triangle, they add up to 180 degrees. So let's do that. So this expression right over her is going to be g. g is that angle right over here. We didn't make any substitutions. So it's going to be g-- actually, let me write the whole thing."
Math,"So we have 900 minus, and instead of a g, well, actually I'm not making a substitution, so I can write g plus, and instead of an h I can write that h is o plus p plus q. And then plus i. i is sitting right over there. Plus i. And then plus j. And I kind of messed up the colors. The magenta will go with i. And then j is this expression right over here. So j is equal to m plus n instead of writing a j right there. And then finally, we have our f. And f, we've already seen, is equal to k plus l."
Math,"So plus k plus l. So once again, I just rewrote this part right over here, in terms of these component angles. And now something very interesting is going to happen, because we know what these sums are going to be. Because we know that g plus k plus o is 180 degrees. They are the measures of the angle for this first triangle over here, for this triangle right over here. So g plus o plus k is 180 degrees. So g-- let me do this in a new color."
Math,"So for this triangle right over here, we know that g plus o plus k are going to be equal to 180 degrees. So if we cross those out, we can write 180 instead. And then we also know-- let me see, I'm definitely running out of colors-- we know that p, for this middle triangle right over here, we know that p plus l plus m is 180 degrees. So you take those out and you know that sum is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And then finally, this is the home stretch here."
Math,"We know that q plus n plus i is 180 degrees in this last triangle. Those three are also going to be 180 degrees. And so now we know that the sum of the interior angles for this irregular pentagon-- it's actually going to be true for any pentagon-- is 180 plus 180 plus 180, which is 540 degrees. So that whole thing is 540 degrees. And if we want to get the sum of those extra angles, we just subtract it from 900. So 900 minus 540 is going to be 360 degrees. And we are done. This is equal to 360 degrees.."
Math,"What are the measures of all the angles? Well, we know one of them. We know it's 10 degrees. Let's draw an arbitrary triangle right over here. So let's say that is our triangle. We know that the smallest angle is going to be 10 degrees. And I'll just say, let's just assume that this right over here is the measure of the smallest angle. It's 10 degrees. Now let's call the second largest angle-- let's call that x. So the second largest angle, let's call that x. So this is going to be x."
Math,"And then the first sentence, they say the measure of the largest angle in a triangle is 4 times the measure of the second largest angle. So the second largest angle is x. 4 times that measure is going to be 4x. So the largest angle is going to be 4x. And so the one thing we know about the measures of the angles inside of a triangle is that they add up to 180 degrees. So we know that 4x plus x plus 10 degrees is going to be equal to 180 degrees. It's going to be equal to 180."
Math,"And 4x plus x, that just gives us 5x. And then we have 5x plus 10 is equal to 180 degrees. Subtract 10 from both sides. You get 5x is equal to 170. And so x is equal to 170/5. And let's see, it'll go into it-- what is that, 34 times? Let me verify this. So 5 goes into-- yeah, it should be 34 times because it's going to go into it twice as many times as 10 would go into it. 10 would go into 170 17 times. 5 would go into 170 34 times. So we could verify it. Go into 170. 5 goes into 17 three times."
Math,"3 times 5 is 15. Subtract, you get 2. Bring down the 0. 5 goes into 20 four times, and then you're not going to have a remainder. 4 times 5 is 20. No remainder. So it's 34 times. So x is equal to 34. So the second largest angle has a measure of 34 degrees. This angle up here is going to be 4 times that. So 4 times 34-- let's see, that's going to be 120 degrees plus 16 degrees. This is going to be 136 degrees. Is that right? 4 times 4 is 16, 4 times 3 is 120, 16 plus 120 is 136 degrees. So we're done."
Math,"The three measures, or the sizes of the three angles, are 10 degrees, 34 degrees, and 136 degrees. Let's do another one. So let's see. We have a little bit of a drawing here. And what I want to do is-- and we could think about different things. We could say, let's solve for x. I'm assuming that 4x is the measure of this angle. 2x is the measure of that angle right over there. We can solve for x."
Math,"And then if we know x, we can figure out what the actual measures of these angles are, assuming that we can figure out x. And the other thing that they tell us is that this line over here is parallel to this line over here. And it was very craftily drawn. Because it's parallel, but one stops here, and then one starts up there. So the first thing I want to do-- if they're telling us that these two lines are parallel, there's probably going to be something involving transversals or something."
Math,"It might be something involving-- the other option is something involving triangles. And at first, you might say, wait, is this angle and that angle vertical angles? But you have to be very careful. They are not. This is not the same line. This line is parallel to that line. This line, it's bending right over there, so we can't make any type of assumption like that."
Math,"So the interesting thing-- and I'm not sure if this will lead in the right direction-- is to just make it clear that these two are part of parallel lines. So I could continue this line down like this. And then I can continue this line up like that. And then that starts to look a little bit more like we're used to when we're dealing with parallel lines. And then this line segment, BC-- or we could even say line BC, if we were to continue it on."
Math,"If we were to continue it on and on, even pass D, then this is clearly a transversal of those two parallel lines. This is clearly a transversal. And so if this angle right over here is 4x, it has a corresponding angle. Half of the-- or maybe most of the work on all of these is to try to see the parallel lines and see the transversal and see the things that might be useful for you. So that right there is the transversal. These are the parallel lines. That's one parallel line."
Math,"That is the other parallel line. You can almost try to zone out all of the other stuff in the diagram. And so if this angle right over here is 4x, it has a corresponding angle where the transversal intersects the other parallel line. This right here is its corresponding angle. So let me draw it in that same yellow. This right over here is a corresponding angle. So this will also be 4x."
Math,"And we see that this angle-- this angle and this angle, this angle that has measure 4x and this angle that measures 2x-- we see that they're supplementary. They're adjacent to each other. Their outer sides form a straight angle. So they're supplementary, which means that their measures add up to 180 degrees. They kind of form-- they go all the way around like that if you add the two adjacent angles together. So we know that 4x plus 2x needs to be equal to 180 degrees, or we get 6x is equal to 180 degrees."
Math,"Divide both sides by 6. You get x is equal to 30, or x is equal to-- well, I shouldn't say-- well, x could be 30. And then this angle right over here is 2 times x. So it's going to be 60 degrees. So this angle right over here is going to be 60 degrees. And this angle right over here is 4 times x. So it is 120 degrees, and we're done.."
Math,"You're also going to use it to calculate distances between points. So it's a good thing to really make sure we know well. So enough talk on my end. Let me tell you what the Pythagorean theorem is. So if we have a triangle, and the triangle has to be a right triangle, which means that one of the three angles in the triangle have to be 90 degrees. And you specify that it's 90 degrees by drawing that little box right there. So that right there is-- let me do this in a different color-- a 90 degree angle."
Math,"Or, we could call it a right angle. And a triangle that has a right angle in it is called a right triangle. So this is called a right triangle. Now, with the Pythagorean theorem, if we know two sides of a right triangle we can always figure out the third side. And before I show you how to do that, let me give you one more piece of terminology. The longest side of a right triangle is the side opposite the 90 degree angle-- or opposite the right angle. So in this case it is this side right here."
Math,"This is the longest side. And the way to figure out where that right triangle is, and kind of it opens into that longest side. That longest side is called the hypotenuse. And it's good to know, because we'll keep referring to it. And just so we always are good at identifying the hypotenuse, let me draw a couple of more right triangles. So let's say I have a triangle that looks like that. Let me draw it a little bit nicer. So let's say I have a triangle that looks like that."
Math,"And I were to tell you that this angle right here is 90 degrees. In this situation this is the hypotenuse, because it is opposite the 90 degree angle. It is the longest side. Let me do one more, just so that we're good at recognizing the hypotenuse. So let's say that that is my triangle, and this is the 90 degree angle right there. And I think you know how to do this already. You go right what it opens into. That is the hypotenuse. That is the longest side."
Math,So once you have identified the hypotenuse-- and let's say that that has length C. And now we're going to learn what the Pythagorean theorem tells us. So let's say that C is equal to the length of the hypotenuse. So let's call this C-- that side is C. Let's call this side right over here A. And let's call this side over here B.
Math,"So the Pythagorean theorem tells us that A squared-- so the length of one of the shorter sides squared-- plus the length of the other shorter side squared is going to be equal to the length of the hypotenuse squared. Now let's do that with an actual problem, and you'll see that it's actually not so bad. So let's say that I have a triangle that looks like this. Let me draw it. Let's say this is my triangle. It looks something like this. And let's say that they tell us that this is the right angle."
Math,"That this length right here-- let me do this in different colors-- this length right here is 3, and that this length right here is 4. And they want us to figure out that length right there. Now the first thing you want to do, before you even apply the Pythagorean theorem, is to make sure you have your hypotenuse straight. You make sure you know what you're solving for. And in this circumstance we're solving for the hypotenuse."
Math,"And we know that because this side over here, it is the side opposite the right angle. If we look at the Pythagorean theorem, this is C. This is the longest side. So now we're ready to apply the Pythagorean theorem. It tells us that 4 squared-- one of the shorter sides-- plus 3 squared-- the square of another of the shorter sides-- is going to be equal to this longer side squared-- the hypotenuse squared-- is going to be equal to C squared. And then you just solve for C."
Math,"So 4 squared is the same thing as 4 times 4. That is 16. And 3 squared is the same thing as 3 times 3. So that is 9. And that is going to be equal to C squared. Now what is 16 plus 9? It's 25. So 25 is equal to C squared. And we could take the positive square root of both sides. I guess, just if you look at it mathematically, it could be negative 5 as well. But we're dealing with distances, so we only care about the positive roots. So you take the principal root of both sides and you get 5 is equal to C."
Math,"Or, the length of the longest side is equal to 5. Now, you can use the Pythagorean theorem, if we give you two of the sides, to figure out the third side no matter what the third side is. So let's do another one right over here. Let's say that our triangle looks like this. And that is our right angle. Let's say this side over here has length 12, and let's say that this side over here has length 6. And we want to figure out this length right over there."
Math,"Now, like I said, the first thing you want to do is identify the hypotenuse. And that's going to be the side opposite the right angle. We have the right angle here. You go opposite the right angle. The longest side, the hypotenuse, is right there. So if we think about the Pythagorean theorem-- that A squared plus B squared is equal to C squared-- 12 you could view as C. This is the hypotenuse. The C squared is the hypotenuse squared. So you could say 12 is equal to C."
Math,"And then we could say that these sides, it doesn't matter whether you call one of them A or one of them B. So let's just call this side right here. Let's say A is equal to 6. And then we say B-- this colored B-- is equal to question mark. And now we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. A squared, which is 6 squared, plus the unknown B squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared-- is equal to C squared. Is equal to 12 squared. And now we can solve for B. And notice the difference here."
Math,"Now we're not solving for the hypotenuse. We're solving for one of the shorter sides. In the last example we solved for the hypotenuse. We solved for C. So that's why it's always important to recognize that A squared plus B squared plus C squared, C is the length of the hypotenuse. So let's just solve for B here. So we get 6 squared is 36, plus B squared, is equal to 12 squared-- this 12 times 12-- is 144. Now we can subtract 36 from both sides of this equation. Those cancel out."
Math,"On the left-hand side we're left with just a B squared is equal to-- now 144 minus 36 is what? 144 minus 30 is 114. And then you subtract 6, is 108. So this is going to be 108. So that's what B squared is, and now we want to take the principal root, or the positive root, of both sides. And you get B is equal to the square root, the principal root, of 108. Now let's see if we can simplify this a little bit. The square root of 108."
Math,"And what we could do is we could take the prime factorization of 108 and see how we can simplify this radical. So 108 is the same thing as 2 times 54, which is the same thing as 2 times 27, which is the same thing as 3 times 9. So we have the square root of 108 is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2 times-- well actually, I'm not done. 9 can be factorized into 3 times 3. So it's 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times 3. And so, we have a couple of perfect squares in here."
Math,"Let me rewrite it a little bit neater. And this is all an exercise in simplifying radicals that you will bump into a lot while doing the Pythagorean theorem, so it doesn't hurt to do it right here. So this is the same thing as the square root of 2 times 2 times 3 times 3 times the square root of that last 3 right over there. And this is the same thing. And, you know, you wouldn't have to do all of this on paper. You could do it in your head. What is this? 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 9, this is 36."
Math,"So this is the square root of 36 times the square root of 3. The principal root of 36 is 6. So this simplifies to 6 square roots of 3. So the length of B, you could write it as the square root of 108, or you could say it's equal to 6 times the square root of 3. This is 12, this is 6. And the square root of 3, well this is going to be a 1 point something something. So it's going to be a little bit larger than 6.."
Math,"This is the 90 degree angle right here. And we're told that this side's length right here is 14. This side's length right over here is 9. And we're told that this side is a. And we need to find the length of a. So as I mentioned already, this is a right triangle. And we know that if we have a right triangle, if we know two of the sides, we can always figure out a third side using the Pythagorean theorem."
Math,"And what the Pythagorean theorem tells us is that the sum of the squares of the shorter sides is going to be equal to the square of the longer side, or the square of the hypotenuse. And if you're not sure about that, you're probably thinking, hey Sal, how do I know that a is shorter than this side over here? How do I know it's not 15 or 16? And the way to tell is that the longest side in a right triangle, and this only applies to a right triangle, is the side opposite the 90 degree angle."
Math,"And in this case, 14 is opposite the 90 degrees. This 90 degree angle kind of opens into this longest side. The side that we call the hypotenuse. So now that we know that that's the longest side, let me color code it. So this is the longest side. This is one of the shorter sides. And this is the other of the shorter sides. The Pythagorean theorem tells us that the sum of the squares of the shorter sides, so a squared plus 9 squared is going to be equal to 14 squared."
Math,"And it's really important that you realize that it's not 9 squared plus 14 squared is going to be equal to a squared. a squared is one of the shorter sides. The sum of the squares of these two sides are going to be equal to 14 squared, the hypotenuse squared. And from here, we just have to solve for a. So we get a squared plus 81 is equal to 14 squared. In case we don't know what that is, let's just multiply it out. 14 times 14. 4 times 4 is 16. 4 times 1 is 4 plus 1 is 5. Take a 0 there. 1 times 4 is 4."
Math,"1 times 1 is 1. 6 plus 0 is 6. 5 plus 4 is 9, bring down the 1. It's 196. So a squared plus 81 is equal to 14 squared, which is 196. Then we could subtract 81 from both sides of this equation. On the left-hand side, we're going to be left with just the a squared. These two guys cancel out, the whole point of subtracting 81. So we're left with a squared is equal to 196 minus 81. What is that? If you just subtract 1, it's 195. If you subtract 80, it would be 115 if I'm doing that right."
Math,"And then to solve for a, we just take the square root of both sides, the principal square root, the positive square root of both sides of this equation. So let's do that. Because we're dealing with distances, you can't have a negative square root, or a negative distance here. And we get a is equal to the square root of 115. Let's see if we can break down 115 any further. So let's see. It's clearly divisible by 5. If you factor it out, it's 5, and then 5 goes in the 115 23 times."
Math,"So both of these are prime numbers. So we're done. So you actually can't factor this anymore. So a is just going to be equal to the square root of 115. Now if you want to get a sense of roughly how large the square root of 115 is, if you think about it, the square root of 100 is equal to 10. And the square root of 121 is equal to 11. So this value right here is going to be someplace in between 10 and 11, which makes sense if you think about it visually.."
Math,"Well the key realization to solve this is to realize that this altitude that they dropped, this is going to form a right angle here and a right angle here and notice, both of these triangles, because this whole thing is an isosceles triangle, we're going to have two angles that are the same. This angle, is the same as that angle. Because it's an isosceles triangle, this 90 degrees is the same as that 90 degrees. And so the third angle needs to be the same."
Math,"So that is going to be the same as that right over there. And since you have two angles that are the same and you have a side between them that is the same this altitude of 12 is on both triangles, we know that both of these triangles are congruent. So they're both going to have 13 they're going to have one side that's 13, one side that is 12 and so this and this side are going to be the same. So this is going to be x over two and this is going to be x over two."
Math,And so now we can use that information and the fact and the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for x. Let's use the Pythagorean Theorem on this right triangle on the right hand side. We can say that x over two squared that's the base right over here this side right over here. We can write that x over two squared plus the other side plus 12 squared is going to be equal to our hypotenuse squared. Is going to be equal to 13 squared. This is just the Pythagorean Theorem now. And so we can simplify.
Math,"This is going to be x. We'll give that the same color. This is going to be x squared over four. That's just x squared over two squared plus 144 144 is equal to 13 squared is 169. Now I can subtract 144 from both sides. I'm gonna try to solve for x. That's the whole goal here. So subtracting 144 from both sides and what do we get? On the left hand side, we have x squared over four is equal to 169 minus 144. Let's see, 69 minus 44 is 25. So this is going to be equal to 25."
Math,"We can multiply both sides by four to isolate the x squared. And so we get x squared is equal to 25 times four is equal to 100. Now, if you're just looking this purely mathematically and say, x could be positive or negative 10. But since we're dealing with distances, we know that we want the positive value of it. So x is equal to the principle root of 100 which is equal to positive 10. So there you have it. We have solved for x."
Math,"This distance right here, the whole thing, the whole thing is going to be equal to 10. Half of that is going to be five. So if we just looked at this length over here. I'm doing that in the same column, let me see. So this length right over here, that's going to be five and indeed, five squared plus 12 squared, that's 25 plus 144 is 169, 13 squared. So the key of realization here is isosceles triangle, the altitudes splits it into two congruent right triangles and so it also splits this base into two."
Math,So this is x over two and this is x over two. And we use that information and the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for x..
Math,"So, we might all remember that the area of a triangle is equal to one half times our base times our height. They give us our base. Our base right over here is, our base is 10. But what is our height? Our height would be, let me do this in another color, our height would be the length of this line right over here. So, if we can figure that out, then we can calculate what one half times the base 10 times the height is."
Math,"But how do we figure out this height? Well, this is where it's useful to recognize that this is an isosceles triangle. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same. And so, these base angles are also going to be congruent. And so, and if we drop an altitude right over here which is the whole point, that's the height, we know that this is, these are going to be right angles. And so, if we have two triangles where two of the angles are the same, we know that the third angle is going to be the same."
Math,"So, that is going to be congruent to that. And so, if you have two triangles, and this might be obvious already to you intuitively, where look, I have two angles in common and the side in between them is common, it's the same length, well that means that these are going to be congruent triangles. Now, what's useful about that is if we recognize that these are congruent triangles, notice that they both have a side 13, they both have a side, whatever this length in blue is."
Math,"And then, they're both going to have a side length that's half of this 10. So, this is going to be five, and this is going to be five. How was I able to deduce that? You might just say, oh that feels intuitively right. I was a little bit more rigorous here, where I said these are two congruent triangles, then we're going to split this 10 in half because this is going to be equal to that and they add up to 10."
Math,"Alright, now we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to figure out the length of this blue side or the height. If we call this h, the Pythagorean Theorem tells us that h squared plus five squared is equal to 13 squared. H squared plus five squared, plus five squared is going to be equal to 13 squared, is going to be equal to our longest side, our hypotenuse squared. And so, let's see. Five squared is 25. 13 squared is 169. We can subtract 25 from both sides to isolate the h squared. So, let's do that."
Math,"And what are we left with? We are left with h squared is equal to these canceled out, 169 minus 25 is 144. Now, if you're doing it purely mathematically, you say, oh h could be plus or minus 12, but we're dealing with the distance, so we'll focus on the positive. So, h is going to be equal to the principal root of 144. So, h is equal to 12. Now, we aren't done. Remember, they don't want us to just figure out the height here, they want us to figure out the area. Area is one half base times height."
Math,"Well, we already figured out that our base is this 10 right over here, let me do this in another color. So, our base is that distance which is 10, and now we know our height. Our height is 12. So, now we just have to compute one half times 10 times 12. Well, that's just going to be equal to one half times 10 is five, times 12 is 60, 60 square units, whatever our units happen to be. That is our area.."
Math,"So let's draw a carpet. It has a length of 7 feet, so let's say that that is 7 feet, right there. And it's going to be a rectangle of some kind. So let's say that we're looking down on the carpet like that. That's our carpet. And then it has a diagonal measurement of square root of 74 feet. So that means that this distance, right here-- draw it a little bit neater than that --this distance right here, the diagonal of the carpet, is the square root of 74 feet."
Math,"And what they want to know is the width of the carpet. Find the width of the carpet. So let's say that this is the width of the carpet. That is w, right there. Now, you might already realize that what I have drawn here is a right triangle. Let me make sure you realize it. This is a 90 degree angle here. And since that is a triangle that has a 90 degree angle, it's a right triangle. The side opposite the right angle, or the 90 degrees, is a hypotenuse, or the longest side. It is the square root of 74."
Math,"And the shorter sides are w and 7. And the Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the sum of the squares of the shorter side will be equal to the square of the hypotenuse, so the square of the longer side. So we get w squared, this side squared. plus 7 squared, this other side squared, is going to be equal to the hypotenuse squared, square root of 74 squared. And then we get w squared plus 49 is equal to the square root of 74 squared. Well, that's just going to be 74. It is equal to 74."
Math,"We can subtract 49 from both sides of this equation. So we have just a w squared on the left-hand side. Subtract 49 from both sides. The left side-- these guys are going to cancel out, we're just going to be left with a w squared --is equal to-- What's 74 minus 49? 74 minus 49, well, we can do a little bit of regrouping or borrowing here, if we don't want to do it in our head. We can make this a 14. This becomes a 6. 14 minus 9 is 5. 6 minus 4 is 2. And we have w squared is equal to 25."
Math,"So w is going to be equal to the square root of 25, the positive square root. So let's take the square root of both sides, the positive square root, and we will get w is equal to 5. Because we obviously we don't want it to be negative 5. That wouldn't be a realistic distance. So the width of the carpet is 5. And we're done.."
Math,I'll start with yellow. So let's say that this is my boat. That is the deck of the boat. And the boat might look something like this. It's a sailing boat. This is the water down here. And then the mast is the thing that holds up the sail. So let me draw ourselves a mast. And they say the mast is 20 feet tall. So this distance right here is 20 feet. That is what is holding up the sail. I can draw it as a pole so it's a little bit clearer. Even shade it in if we like.
Math,"And then they say a rope attaches to the deck 15 feet away from the base of the mast. So this is the base of the mast. This is the deck right here. The rope attaches 15 feet away from the base of the mast. So if this is the base of the mast, we go 15 feet, might be about that distance right there. Let me mark that. And the rope attaches right here. From the top of the mast all the way that base. So the rope goes like that."
Math,"And then they ask us, how long is the rope? So there's a few things you might realize. We're dealing with a triangle here. And it's not any triangle. We're assuming that the mast goes straight up and that the deck is straight left and right. So this is a right triangle. This is a 90 degree angle right here. And we know that, if we know two sides of a right triangle, we can always figure out the third side of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem."
Math,"And all that tells us is it the sum of the squares of the shorter sides of the triangle are going to be equal to the square of the longer side. And that longer side is call the hypotenuse. And in all cases, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the 90 degree angle. It is always going to be the longest side of our right triangle. So we need to figure out the hypotenuse here. We know the lengths of the two shorter sides. So we can see that if we take 15 squared, that's one of the short sides, I'm squaring it."
Math,"And then add that to the square of the other shorter side, to 20 feet squared. And when I say the shorter side, I mean relative to the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse will always be the longest side. Let's say the hypotenuse is in green just so we get our color coding nice. That is going to be equal to the rope squared. Or the length of the rope. Let's call this distance right here r. r for rope. So 15 squared plus 20 squared is going to be equal to r squared. And what's 15 squared? It's 225. 20 squared is 400."
Math,"And that's going to be equal to r squared. Now 225 plus 400 is 625. 625 is equal to r squared. And then we can take the principal root of both sides of this equation. Because we're talking about distances, we want the positive square root. So you take the positive square root, or the principal root, of both sides of this equation. And you are left with r is equal to the square root of 625. You can play with it a little bit if you like."
Math,"But if you've ever played with numbers around 25, you'll see that this is 25 squared. So r is equal to the square root of 625, which is 25. So this distance right here, the length of the rope, is equal to 25 feet.."
Math,"And then on top of that, on top of that, we have what you could call a right pyramid, where the height of this right pyramid, so if you start at the center of its base right over here, and you go to the top, this height right over here is one unit. And this hasn't been drawn completely to scale, and kind of the perspective skews a little bit."
Math,"But our goal here, our goal here, is to figure out what is the length? What is the length of one of these edges right over here? So either that one, or this one right over here. What is that length? And we will call that, we will call that x. And so I encourage you to pause this video and try to think about it on your own. Remember, this is a right, this is a right pyramid. So what that tells us is that this red line, that's one unit long, it is perpendicular, it is perpendicular to this entire plane."
Math,"It's perpendicular to the top of the rectangular prism. So with that in mind, I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can figure it out. And I will give you a hint. You will have to use the Pythagorean theorum, maybe more than once. Alright, so I am assuming you've at least given it a shot. So let's work through it together. So the key here is to realize, well okay this point, this base right over here, this point right over here it's half way in this direction and half way in this direction."
Math,"So we can figure out, well this entire length right over here is length four. So half way, this is going to be, I'll write it with perspective. That's going to be two, and that's going to be two. Just like that. And then the other thing we can figure out, we can figure out what this length is going to be. 'Cause once again it's half way in that direction. So if this whole thing is two, and we see it right over here. This is a rectangular prism, so this length is going to be the same thing as this length."
Math,"So if this whole thing is two, then each of these, this is going to be one, and this is going to be one right over there. Well how does that help us? Well using that information, we should be able to figure out this length. Actually, I'll keep it in this color 'cause this color's easy to see. We should be able to figure out this length. Well why is this length interesting? Well if we know that length, that length forms a right triangle."
Math,"That length and the one are the two non-hypotenuse sides of a right triangle. And then the x would be the hypotenuse. So we could just apply the Pythagorean theorem. So if we can figure out this, we can figure out x. So let's do one step at a time. How do we figure out, how do we figure out I dunno, let me call this length. How do we figure out length a? Well let's just take it out and look at it in two dimensions."
Math,"So if we look at it in two dimensions, If we look at it in two dimensions, it would look something like this. So that's our length a. We know that this length is half of this side right over here, so that's going to be one. And actually let me do it in the same colors. So this right over here is the same thing as this right over here. And it is going to be of length one. And then this right over here is going to be the same as this right over here, which is going to be of length two."
Math,"And so we can just use the Pythagorean theorem here. We know that the hypotenuse squared is going to be equal to one squared, one squared plus two squared. One squared plus two squared, which of course, is equal to one plus four, which is equal to five. So we could write a... Let me do this in the magenta color. We can write a squared is equal to five, or we could say that a is equal to the principal root of five. So this length right over here is the square root of five, the principal root of five."
Math,"And now we can use that information to solve for x. So let's take this right triangle. And it takes a little bit of visualization practice to visualize this right. But notice, this is a right triangle. This height right here of length one is perpendicular to this entire plane. So let's see if I can draw it. So we have this side is the square root of five. And then we have a height, Let me do it, looks like it's in a... Well, I'd say we're talkin' about this height right over here is length one."
Math,"So I'll draw that, that is of length one. And we are trying to figure out x. We are trying to figure out x in orange. So we're trying to figure out this x. And once again, we know this is a right triangle. This is a right triangle, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem again. So we will have x squared is equal to one squared. Which is just, I'll just write it one squared plus square root of five squared, plus square root of five squared."
Math,"Well, that gets us x squared is equal to one plus five, right? Square root of five squared is just five. So one plus five is equal to six. So we get x is equal to the square root of six. And we're done! We figured out the length of this side right over here.."
Math,"Let's say I have the point 3 comma negative 4. So if I were to graph it, I'd go 1, 2, 3, and then I'd go down 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, right there, is 3 comma negative 4. And let's say I also have the point 6 comma 0. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then there's no movement in the y-direction. We're just sitting on the x-axis. The y-coordinate is 0, so that's 6 comma 0. And what I want to figure out is the distance between these two points."
Math,"How far is this blue point away from this orange point? And at first, you're like, gee, Sal, I don't think I've ever seen anything about how to solve for a distance like this. And what are you even talking about the Pythagorean theorem? I don't see a triangle there! And if you don't see a triangle, let me draw it for you. Let me draw this triangle right there, just like that. Let me actually do several colors here, just to really hit the point home. So there is our triangle."
Math,"And you might immediately recognize this is a right triangle. This is a right angle right there. The base goes straight left to right, the right side goes straight up and down, so we're dealing with a right triangle. So if we could just figure out what the base length is and what this height is, we could use the Pythagorean theorem to figure out this long side, the side that is opposite the right angle, the hypotenuse. This right here, the distance is the hypotenuse of this right triangle."
Math,"Let me write that down. The distance is equal to the hypotenuse of this right triangle. So let me draw it a little bit bigger. So this is the hypotenuse right there. And then we have the side on the right, the side that goes straight up and down. And then we have our base. Now, how do we figure out-- let's call this d for distance. That's the length of our hypotenuse. How do we figure out the lengths of this up and down side and the base side right here? So let's look at the base first."
Math,"What is this distance? You could even count it on this graph paper, but here, where x is equal to-- let me do it in the green. Here, we're at x is equal to 3 and here we're at x is equal to 6, right? We're just moving straight right. This is the same distance as that distance right there. So to figure out that distance, it's literally the end x point."
Math,"And you could actually go either way, because you're going to square everything, so it doesn't matter if you get negative numbers, so the distance here is going to be 6 minus 3, right? 6 minus 3. That's this distance right here, which is equal to 3. So we figured out the base. And to just remind ourselves, that is equal to the change in x. That was equal to your finishing x minus your starting x. 6 minus 3. This is our delta x."
Math,"Now, by the same exact line of reasoning, this height right here is going to be your change in y. Up here, you're at y is equal to 0. That's kind of where you finish. That's your higher y point. And over here, you're at y is equal to negative 4. So change in y is equal to 0 minus negative 4. I'm just taking the larger y-value minus the smaller y-value, the larger x-value minus the smaller x-value."
Math,"But you're going to see we're going to square it in a second, so even if you did it the other way around, you'd get a negative number, but you'd still get the same answer, so this is equal to 4. So this side is equal to 4. You can even count it on the graph paper if you like. And this side is equal to 3. And now we can do the Pythagorean theorem. This distance is the distance squared. Be careful."
Math,"The distance squared is going to be equal to this delta x squared, the change in x squared plus the change in y squared. This is nothing fancy. Sometimes people will call this the distance formula. It's just the Pythagorean theorem. This side squared plus that side squared is equal to hypotenuse squared, because this is a right triangle. So let's apply it with these numbers, the numbers that we have at hand."
Math,"So the distance squared is going to be equal to delta x squared is 3 squared plus delta y squared plus 4 squared, which is equal to 9 plus 16, which is equal to 25. So the distance is equal to-- let me write that-- d squared is equal to 25. d, our distance, is equal to-- you don't want to take the negative square root, because you can't have a negative distance, So it's only the principal root, the positive square root of 25, which is equal to 5. So this distance right here is 5."
Math,"Or if we look at this distance right here, that was the original problem. How far is this point from that point? It is 5 units away. So what you'll see here, they call it the distance formula, but it's just the Pythagorean theorem. And just so you're exposed to all of the ways that you'll see the distance formula, sometimes people will say, oh, if I have two points, if I have one point, let's call it x1 and y1, so that's just a particular point. And let's say I have another point that is x2 comma y2."
Math,"Sometimes, you'll see this formula, that the distance-- you'll see it in different ways. But you'll see that the distance is equal to-- and it looks as though there's this really complicated formula, but I want you to see that this is really just the Pythagorean theorem. You see that the distance is equal to x2 minus x1 minus x1 squared plus y2 minus y1 squared. You'll see this written in a lot of textbooks as the distance formula."
Math,"And it's a complete waste of your time to memorize it because it's really just the Pythagorean theorem. This is your change in x. And it really doesn't matter which x you pick to be first or second, because even if you get the negative of this value, when you square it, the negative disappears. This right here is your change in y."
Math,"So it's just saying that the distance squared-- remember, if you square both sides of this equation, the radical will disappear and this will be the distance squared is equal to this expression squared, delta x squared, change in x-- delta means change in-- delta x squared plus delta y squared. I don't want to confuse you. Delta y just means change in y. I should have probably said that earlier in the video. But let's apply it to a couple more, and I'll just pick some points at random."
Math,"Let's say I have the point, let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Negative 6 comma negative 4. And let's say I want to find the distance between that and 1 comma 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and the point 1 comma 7, so I want to find this distance right here. So it's the exact same idea. We just use the Pythagorean theorem. You figure out this distance, which is our change in x, this distance, which is our change in y. This distance squared plus this distance squared is going to equal that distance squared. So let's do it."
Math,"So our change in x, you just take-- you know, it doesn't matter. In general, you want to take the larger x-value minus the smaller x-value, but you could do it either way. So we could write the distance squared is equal to-- what's our change in x? So let's take the larger x minus the smaller x, 1 minus negative 6. 1 minus negative 6 squared plus the change in y. The larger y is here. It's 7. 7 minus negative 4. 7 minus negative 4 squared."
Math,"And I just picked these numbers at random, so they're probably not going to come out too cleanly. So we get that the distance squared is equal to 1 minus negative 6. That is 7, 7 squared, and you'll even see it over here, if you count it. You go, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's that number right here. That's what your change in x is. Plus 7 minus negative 4. That's 11. That's this distance right here, and you can count it on the blocks. We're going up 11."
Math,"We're just taking 7 minus negative 4 to get a distance of 11. So plus 11 squared is equal to d squared. So let me just take the calculator out. So the distance if we take 7 squared plus 11 squared is equal to 170, that distance is going to be the square root of that, right? d squared is equal to 170. So let's take the square root of 170 and we get 13.0, roughly 13.04. So this distance right here that we tried to figure out is 13.04. Hopefully, you found that helpful.."
Math,"He was elected in 1880, and then he became president in 1881. And he did this proof while he was a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives. And what's exciting about that is that it shows that Abraham Lincoln was not the only US politician or not the only US President who was really into geometry. And what Garfield realized is, if you construct a right triangle-- so I'm going to do my best attempt to construct one. So let me construct one right here."
Math,"So let's say this side right over here is length b. Let's say this side is length a, and let's say that this side, the hypotenuse of my right triangle, has length c. So I've just constructed enough a right triangle, and let me make it clear. It is a right triangle. He essentially flipped and rotated this right triangle to construct another one that is congruent to the first one. So let me construct that. So we're going to have length b, and it's collinear with length It's along the same line, I should say."
Math,"They don't overlap with each other. So this is side of length b, and then you have a side of length-- let me draw a it so this will be a little bit taller-- side of length b. And then, you have your side of length a at a right angle. Your side of length a comes in at a right angle. And then, you have your side of length c."
Math,"So the first thing we need to think about is what's the angle between these two sides? What's this mystery angle? What's that mystery angle going to be? Well, it looks like something, but let's see if we can prove to ourselves that it really is what we think it looks like."
Math,"If we look at this original triangle and we call this angle ""theta,"" what's this angle over here, the angle that's between sides of length a and length c? What's the measure of this angle going to be? Well, theta plus this angle have to add up to 90. Because you add those two together, they add up to 90. And then, you have another 90. You're going to get 180 degrees for the interior angles of this triangle. So these two have to add up to 90. This angle is going to be 90 minus theta."
Math,"Well, if this triangle appears congruent-- and we've constructed it so it is congruent-- the corresponding angle to this one is this angle right over here. So this is also going to be theta, and this right over here is going to be 90 minus theta. So given that this is theta, this is 90 minus theta, what is our angle going to be? Well, they all collectively go 180 degrees. So you have theta, plus 90 minus theta, plus our mystery angle is going to be equal to 180 degrees. The thetas cancel out."
Math,"Theta minus theta. And you have 90 plus our mystery angle is 180 degrees. Subtract 90 from both sides, and you are left with your mystery angle equaling 90 degrees. So that all worked out well. So let me make that clear, and that's going to be useful for us in a second. It's going to be useful. So we can now say definitively that this is 90 degrees. This is a right angle. Now, what we are going to do is we are going to construct a trapezoid."
Math,"This side a is parallel to side b down here, the way it's been constructed, and this is just one side right over here. This goes straight up, and now let's just connect these two sides right over there. So there's a couple of ways to think about the area of this trapezoid. One is we could just think of it as a trapezoid and come up with its area, and then we could think about it as the sum of the areas of its components."
Math,"So let's just first think of it as a trapezoid so what do we know about the area of a trapezoid? Well, the area of a trapezoid is going to be the height of the trapezoid, which is a plus b. That's the height of the trapezoid. Times-- the way I think of it-- the mean of the top and the bottom, or the average of the top and the bottom. Since that's this times one half times a plus a plus b. And the intuition there, you're taking the height times the average of this bottom and the top."
Math,"The average of the bottom and the top gives you the area of the trapezoid. Now, how could we also figure out the area with its component parts? Regardless of how we calculate the area, as long as we do correct things, we should come up with the same result. So how else can we come up with this area? Well, we could say it's the area of the two right triangles. The area of each of them is one half a times b, but there's two of them. Let me do that b in that same blue color."
Math,"But there's two of these right triangle. So let's multiply by two. So two times one half ab. That takes into consideration this bottom right triangle and this top one. And what's the area of this large one that I will color in in green? What's the area of this large one? Well, that's pretty straightforward. It's just one half c times c. So plus one half c times c, which is one half c squared. Now, let's simplify this thing and see what we come up with, and you might guess where all of this is going."
Math,"So let's see what we get. So we can rearrange this. Let me rearrange this. So one half times a plus b squared is going to be equal to 2 times one half. Well, that's just going to be one. So it's going to be equal to a times b, plus one half c squared. Well, I don't like these one halfs laying around, so let's multiply both sides of this equation by 2. I'm just going to multiply both sides of this equation by 2. On the left-hand side, I'm just left with a plus b squared. So let me write that."
Math,"And on the right-hand side, I am left with 2ab. Trying to keep the color coding right. And then, 2 times one half c squared, that's just going to be c squared plus c squared. Well, what happens if you multiply out a plus b times a plus b? What is a plus b squared? Well, it's going to be a squared plus 2ab plus 2ab plus b squared. And then, our right-hand side it's going to be equal to all of this business. And changing all the colors is difficult for me, so let me copy and let me paste it."
Math,"So it's still going to be equal to the right-hand side. Well, this is interesting. How can we simplify this? Is there anything that we can subtract from both sides? Well, sure there is. You have a 2ab on the left-hand side. You have a 2ab on the right-hand side. Let's subtract 2ab from both sides. If you subtract 2ab from both sides, what are you left with? You are left with the Pythagorean theorem. So you're left with a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared. Very, very exciting."
Math,"And for that, we have to thank the 20th president of the United States, James Garfield. This is really exciting. The Pythagorean theorem, it was around for thousands of years before James Garfield, and he was able to contribute just kind of fiddling around while he was a member of the US House of Representatives.."
Math,I'm going to draw it tilted at a bit of an angle just because I think it'll make it a little bit easier on me. So let me do my best attempt at drawing something that reasonably looks like a square. You have to bear with me if it's not exactly a tilted square. So that looks pretty good. And I'm assuming it's a square. So this is a right angle. This is a right angle. That's a right angle. That's a right angle. I'm assuming the lengths of all of these sides are the same.
Math,"So let's just assume that they're all of length, c. I'll write that in yellow. So all of the sides of the square are of length, c. And now I'm going to construct four triangles inside of this square. And the way I'm going to do it is I'm going to be dropping. So here I'm going to go straight down, and I'm going to drop a line straight down and draw a triangle that looks like this. So I'm going to go straight down here. Here, I'm going to go straight across."
Math,"And so since this is straight down and this is straight across, we know this is a right angle. Then from this vertex on our square, I'm going to go straight up. And since this is straight up and this is straight across, we know that this is a right angle. And then from this vertex right over here, I'm going to go straight horizontally. I'm assuming that's what I'm doing. And so we know that this is going to be a right angle, and then we know this is going to be a right angle."
Math,"So we see that we've constructed, from our square, we've constructed four right triangles. And in between, we have something that, at minimum, looks like a rectangle or possibly a square. We haven't quite proven to ourselves yet that this is a square. Now the next thing I want to think about is whether these triangles are congruent. So they definitely all have the same length of their hypotenuse. All of the hypot-- I don't know what the plural of hypotenuse is, hypoteni, hypotenuses."
Math,"They have all length, c. The side opposite the right angle is always length, c. So if we can show that all the corresponding angles are the same, then we know it's congruent. If you have something where all the angles are the same and you have a side that is also-- the corresponding side is also congruent, then the whole triangles are congruent. And we can show that if we assume that this angle is theta. Then this angle right over here has to be 90 minus theta because together they are complimentary."
Math,"We know that because they go combine to form this angle of the square, this right angle. And this is 90 minus theta. We know this angle and this angle have to add up to 90 because we only have 90 left when we subtract the right angle from 180. So we know this has to be theta. And if that's theta, then that's 90 minus theta. I think you see where this is going. If that's 90 minus theta, this has to be theta. And if that's theta, then this is 90 minus theta."
Math,"If this is 90 minus theta, then this is theta, and then this would have to be 90 minus theta. So we see in all four of these triangles, the three angles are theta, 90 minus theta, and 90 degrees. So they all have the same exact angle, so at minimum, they are similar, and their hypotenuses are the same. So we know that all four of these triangles are completely congruent triangles. So with that assumption, let's just assume that the longer side of these triangles, that these are of length, b."
Math,"So the longer side of these triangles I'm just going to assume. So this length right over here, I'll call that lowercase b. And let's assume that the shorter side, so this distance right over here, this distance right over here, this distance right over here, that these are all-- this distance right over here, that these are of length, a. So if I were to say this height right over here, this height is of length-- that is of length, a. Now we will do something interesting."
Math,"Well, first, let's think about the area of the entire square. What's the area of the entire square in terms of c? Well, that's pretty straightforward. It's a c by c square. So the area here is equal to c squared. Now, what I'm going to do is rearrange two of these triangles and then come up with the area of that other figure in terms of a's and b's, and hopefully it gets us to the Pythagorean theorem."
Math,"And to do that, just so we don't lose our starting point because our starting point is interesting, let me just copy and paste this entire thing. So I don't want it to clip off. So let me just copy and paste this. Copy and paste. So this is our original diagram. And what I will now do-- and actually, let me clear that out. Edit clear. I'm now going to shift. This is the fun part. I'm going to shift this triangle here in the top left. I'm going to shift it below this triangle on the bottom right."
Math,"And I'm going to attempt to do that by copying and pasting. So let's see how much-- well, the way I drew it, it's not that-- well, that might do the trick. I want to retain a little bit of the-- so let me copy, or let me actually cut it, and then let me paste it. So that triangle I'm going to stick right over there. And let me draw in the lines that I just erased. So just to be clear, we had a line over there, and we also had this right over here."
Math,"And this was straight up and down, and these were straight side to side. Now, so I moved this part over down here. So I moved that over down there. And now I'm going to move this top right triangle down to the bottom left. So I'm just rearranging the exact same area. So actually let me just capture the whole thing as best as I can. So let me cut and then let me paste. And I'm going to move it right over here. While I went through that process, I kind of lost its floor, so let me redraw the floor."
Math,"So I just moved it right over here. So this thing, this triangle-- let me color it in-- is now right over there. And this triangle is now right over here. That center square, it is a square, is now right over here. So hopefully you can appreciate how we rearranged it. Now my question for you is, how can we express the area of this new figure, which has the exact same area as the old figure? I just shifted parts of it around."
Math,"How can we express this in terms of the a's and b's? Well, the key insight here is to recognize the length of this bottom side. What's the length of this bottom side right over here? The length of this bottom side-- well this length right over here is b, this length right over here is a. So the length of this entire bottom is a plus b. Well that by itself is kind of interesting. But what we can realize is that this length right over here, which is the exact same thing as this length over here, was also a."
Math,"So we can construct an a by a square. So this square right over here is a by a, and so it has area, a squared. Let me do that in a color that you can actually see. So this has area of a squared. And then what's the area of what's left over? Well if this is length, a, then this is length, a, as well. If this entire bottom is a plus b, then we know that what's left over after subtracting the a out has to b. If this whole thing is a plus b, this is a, then this right over here is b."
Math,"And so the rest of this newly oriented figure, this new figure, everything that I'm shading in over here, this is just a b by b square. So the area here is b squared. So the entire area of this figure is a squared plus b squared, which lucky for us, is equal to the area of this expressed in terms of c because of the exact same figure, just rearranged. So it's going to be equal to c squared. And it all worked out, and Bhaskara gave us a very cool proof of the Pythagorean theorem.."
Math,"It's a very fancy word for a fairly simple idea, just the longest side of a right triangle or the side opposite the 90 degree angle. And it's just good to know that because someone might say hypotenuse. You're like, oh, they're just talking about this side right here, the side longest, the side opposite the 90 degree angle. Now, what I want to do in this video is prove a relationship, a very famous relationship. And you might see where this is going."
Math,"A very famous relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. So let's say that the length of AC, so uppercase A, uppercase C, let's call that length lowercase a. Let's call the length of BC lowercase b right over here. I'll use uppercases for points, lowercases for lengths. And let's call the length of the hypotenuse, the length of AB, let's call that c. And let's see if we can come up with the relationship between a, b, and c."
Math,"And to do that I'm first going to construct another line or another segment, I should say, between c and the hypotenuse. And I'm going to construct it so that they intersect at a right angle. And you can always do that. And we'll call this point right over here we'll. Call this point capital D. And if you're wondering, how can you always do that? You could imagine rotating this entire triangle like this."
Math,"This isn't a rigorous proof, but it just kind of gives you the general idea of how you can always construct a point like this. So if I've rotated it around. So now our hypotenuse, we're now sitting on our hypotenuse. This is now point B, this is point A. So we've rotated the whole thing all the way around. This is point C. You could imagine just dropping a rock from point C, maybe with a string attached, and it would hit the hypotenuse at a right angle."
Math,"So that's all we did here to establish segment CD into where we put our point D right over there. And the reason why did that is now we can do all sorts of interesting relationships between similar triangles. Because we have three triangles here. We have triangle ADC, we have triangle DBC, and then we have the larger original triangle. And we can hopefully establish similarity between those triangles. And first I'll show you that ADC is similar to the larger one. Because both of them have a right angle."
Math,"ADC has a right angle right over here. Clearly if this angle is 90 degrees, then this angle is going to be 90 degrees as well. They are supplementary. They have to add up to 180. And so they both have a right angle in them. So the smaller one has a right angle. The larger one clearly has a right angle. That's where we started from. And they also both share this angle right over here, angle DAC or BAC, however you want to refer to it. So we can actually write down that triangle."
Math,"I'm going to start with the smaller one, ADC. And maybe I'll shade it in right over here. So this is the triangle we're talking about. Triangle ADC. And I went from the blue angle to the right angle to the unlabeled angle from the point of view of triangle ADC. This right angle isn't applying to that right over there. It's applying to the larger triangle. So we could say triangle ADC is similar to triangle-- once again, you want to start at the blue angle. A. Then we went to the right angle."
Math,"So we have to go to the right angle again. So it's ACB. And because they're similar, we can set up a relationship between the ratios of their sides. For example, we know the ratio of corresponding sides are going to do, well, in general for a similar triangle, we know the ratio of the corresponding sides are going to be a constant. So we could take the ratio of the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle. So the hypotenuse is AC."
Math,"So AC over the hypotenuse over the larger one, which is a AB, AC over AB is going to be the same thing as AD as one of the legs, AD. And just to show that, I'm just taking corresponding points on both similar triangles, this is AD over AC. You could look at these triangles yourself and show, look, AD, point AD, is between the blue angle and the right angle. Sorry, side AD is between the blue angle and the right angle. Side AC is between the blue angle and the right angle on the larger triangle."
Math,"So both of these are from the larger triangle. These are the corresponding sides on the smaller triangle. And if that is confusing looking at them visually, as long as we wrote our similarity statement correctly, you can just find the corresponding points. AC corresponds to AB on the larger triangle, AD on the smaller triangle corresponds to AC on the larger triangle. And we know that AC, we can rewrite that as lowercase a. AC is lowercase a. We don't have any label for AD or for AB."
Math,"Sorry, we do have a label for AB. That is c right over here. We don't have a label for AD. So AD, let's just call that lowercase d. So lowercase d applies to that part right over there. c applies to that entire part right over there. And then we'll call DB, let's call that length e. That'll just make things a little bit simpler for us. So AD we'll just call d. And so we have a over c is equal to d over a. If we cross multiply, you have a times a, which is a squared, is equal to c times d, which is cd."
Math,"So that's a little bit of an interesting result. Let's see what we can do with the other triangle right over here. So this triangle right over here. So once again, it has a right angle. The larger one has a right angle. And they both share this angle right over here. So by angle, angle similarity, the two triangles are going to be similar. So we could say triangle BDC, we went from pink to right to not labeled. So triangle BDC is similar to triangle."
Math,"Now we're going to look at the larger triangle, we're going to start at the pink angle. B. Now we're going to go to the right angle. From pink angle to right angle to non-labeled angle, at least from the point of view here. We labeled it before with that blue. So now let's set up some type of relationship here. We can say that the ratio on the smaller triangle, BC, side BC over BA, BC over BA, once again, we're taking the hypotenuses of both of them. So BC over BA is going to be equal to BD."
Math,"Let me do this in another color. So this is one of the legs. The way I drew it is the shorter legs. BD over BC. I'm just taking the corresponding vertices. Over BC. And once again, we know BC is the same thing as lowercase b. BC is lowercase b. BA is lowercase c. And then BD we defined as lowercase e. So this is lowercase e."
Math,"We can cross multiply here and we get b times b, which, and I've mentioned this in many videos, cross multiplying is really the same thing as multiplying both sides by both denominators. b times b is b squared is equal to ce. And now we can do something kind of interesting. We can add these two statements. Let me rewrite the statement down here. So b squared is equal to ce. So if we add the left hand sides, we get a squared plus b squared. a squared plus b squared is equal to cd plus ce."
Math,"And then we have a c both of these terms, so we could factor it out. So this is going to be equal to-- we can factor out the c. It's going to be equal to c times d plus e. c times d plus e and close the parentheses. Now what is d plus e? d is this length, e is this length. So d plus e is actually going to be c as well. So this is going to be c. So you have c times c, which is just the same thing as c squared. So now we have an interesting relationship."
Math,"We have that a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared. Let me rewrite that. a squared. Well, let me just do an arbitrary new color. I deleted that by accident, so let me rewrite it. So we've just established that a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared. And this is just an arbitrary right triangle. This is true for any two right triangles. We've just established that the sum of the squares of each of the legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse."
Math,"And this is probably what's easily one of the most famous theorem in mathematics, named for Pythagoras. Not clear if he's the first person to establish this, but it's called the Pythagorean Theorem. And it's really the basis of, well, all not all of geometry, but a lot of the geometry that we're going to do. And it forms the basis of a lot of the trigonometry we're going to do. And it's a really useful way, if you know two of the sides of a right triangle, you can always find the third.."
Math,"So I'm going to construct it so that its hypotenuse sits on the bottom. So that's the hypotenuse of my right triangle. Try to draw it as big as possible, so that we have space to work with. So that's going to be my hypotenuse. And then let's say that this is the longer side that's not the hypotenuse. We can have two sides that are equal. But I'll just draw it so that it looks a little bit longer. Let's call that side length a. And then let's draw this side right over here. It has to be a right triangle."
Math,"So maybe it goes right over there. That's side of length b. Let me extend the length a a little bit. So it definitely looks like a right triangle. And this is our 90-degree angle. So the first thing that I'm going to do is take this triangle and then rotate it counterclockwise by 90 degrees. So if I rotate it counterclockwise by 90 degrees, I'm literally just going to rotate it like that and draw another completely congruent version of this one. So I'm going to rotate it by 90 degrees."
Math,"And if I did that, the hypotenuse would then sit straight up. So I'm going to do my best attempt to draw it almost to scale as much as I can eyeball it. This side of length a will now look something like this. It'll actually be parallel to this over here. So let me see how well I can draw it. So this is the side of length a. And if we cared, this would be 90 degrees. The rotation between the corresponding sides are just going to be 90 degrees in every case. That's going to be 90 degrees."
Math,"That's going to be 90 degrees. Now, let me draw side b. So it's going to look something like that or the side that's length b. And this and the right angle is now here. So all I did is I rotated this by 90 degrees counterclockwise. Now, what I want to do is construct a parallelogram. I'm going to construct a parallelogram by essentially-- and let me label. So this is height c right over here. Let me do that white color. This is height c. Now, what I want to do is go from this point and go up c as well."
Math,"Now, so this is height c as well. And what is this length? What is the length over here from this point to this point going to be? Well, a little clue is this is a parallelogram. This line right over here is going to be parallel to this line. It's maintained the same distance. And since it's traveling the same distance in the x direction or in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction, this is going to be the same length. So this is going to be of length a."
Math,"Now, the next question I have for you is, what is the area of this parallelogram that I have just constructed? Well, to think about that, let's redraw this part of the diagram so that the parallelogram is sitting on the ground. So this is length a. This is length c. This is length c. And if you look at this part right over here, it gives you a clue. I'll use this green color. The height of the parallelogram is given right over here. This side is perpendicular to the base."
Math,"So the height of the parallelogram is a as well. So what's the area? Well, the area of a parallelogram is just the base times the height. So the area of this parallelogram right over here is going to be a squared. Now, let's do the same thing. But let's rotate our original right triangle. Let's rotate it the other way. So let's rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. And this time, instead of pivoting on this point, we're going to pivot on that point right over there."
Math,"So what are we going to get? So the side of length c if we rotate it like that, it's going to end up right over here. I'll try to draw it as close to scale as possible. So that side has length c. Now, the side of length of b is going to pop out and look something like this. It's going to be parallel to that. This is going to be a right angle. So let me draw it like that. That looks pretty good. And then the side of length a is going to be out here. So that's a. And then this right over here is b."
Math,"And I wanted to do that b in blue. So let me do the b in blue. And then this right angle once we've rotated is just sitting right over here. Now, let's do the same exercise. Let's construct a parallelogram right over here. So this is height c. This is height c as well. So by the same logic we used over here, if this length is b, this length is b as well. These are parallel lines. We're going the same distance in the horizontal direction. We're rising the same in the vertical direction."
Math,"We know that because they're parallel. So this is length b down here. This is length b up there. Now, what is the area of this parallelogram right over there? What is the area of that parallelogram going to be? Well, once again to help us visualize it, we can draw it sitting flat. So this is that side. Then you have another side right over here. They both have length b. And you have the sides of length c. So that's c. That's c. What is its height? Well, you see it right over here."
Math,"Its height is length b as well. It gives us right there. We know that this is 90 degrees. We did a 90-degree rotation. So this is how we constructed the thing. So given that, the area of a parallelogram is just the base times the height. The area of this parallelogram is b squared. So now, things are starting to get interesting. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy and paste this part right over here, because this is, in my mind, the most interesting part of our diagram."
Math,"Let me see how well I can select it. So let me select this part right over here. So let me copy. And then I'm going to scroll down. And then let me paste it. So this diagram that we've constructed right over here, it's pretty clear what the area of it is, the combined diagram. And let me delete a few parts of it. I want to do that in black so that it cleans it up. So let me clean this thing up, so we really get the part that we want to focus on."
Math,"So cleaning that up and cleaning this up, cleaning this up right over there. And actually, let me delete this right down here as well, although we know that this length was c. And actually, I'll draw it right over here. This was from our original construction. We know that this length is c. We know this height is c. We know this down here is c. But my question for you is, what is the area of this combined shape? Well, it's just a squared plus b squared. Let me write that down."
Math,"The area is just a squared plus b squared, the area of those two parallelograms. Now, how can we maybe rearrange pieces of this shape so that we can express it in terms of c? Well, it might have jumped out at you when I drew this line right over here. I want to do that in white. We know that this part right over here is of length c. This comes from our original construction. Whoops. I lost my diagram. This is of length c. That's of length c. And then this right over here is of length c."
Math,"And so what we could do is take this top right triangle, which is completely congruent to our original right triangle, and shift it down. So remember, the entire area, including this top right triangle, is a squared plus b squared. But we're excluding this part down here, which was our original triangle. But what happens if we take that? So let me actually cut. And then let me paste it. And all I'm doing is I'm moving that triangle down here. So now, it looks like this."
Math,"So I've just rearranged the area that was a squared b squared. So this entire area of this entire square is still a squared plus b squared. a squared is this entire area right over here. It was before a parallelogram. I just shifted that top part of the parallelogram down. b squared is this entire area right over here. Well, what's this going to be in terms of c? Well, we know that this entire thing is a c by c square. So the area in terms of c is just c squared."
Math,"So a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared. And we have, once again, proven the Pythagorean theorem.."
Math,"And then this is the height of my cylinder. This is the bottom right over here. If this was transparent, maybe you could see the back side of the cylinder. So you could imagine this kind of looks like a soda can. And let's say that the height of my cylinder, h, is equal to 8. I'll give it some units. 8 centimeters, that is my height. And then let's say that the radius of one of the top of my cylinder of my soda can, let's say that this radius over here is equal to 4 centimeters."
Math,"So what is the volume here? What is the volume going to be? And the idea here is really the exact same thing that we saw in some of the previous problems. If you can find the surface area of one side and then figure out how deep it goes, you'll be able to figure out the volume. So what we're going to do here is figure out the surface area of the top of this cylinder, or the top of the soda can. And then we're going to multiply it by its height. And that'll give us a volume."
Math,"This will tell us essentially, how many square centimeters fit in this top. And then if we multiply that by how many centimeters we go down, then that'll give us the number of cubic centimeters in this cylinder or soda can. So how do we figure out this area up here? Well the area at the top, this is just finding the area of a circle. You could imagine drawing it like this. If we were to just look at it straight on, that's a circle with a radius of 4 centimeters."
Math,"The area of a circle with a radius 4 centimeters, area is equal to pi r squared. So it's going to be pi times the radius squared, times 4 centimeters squared, which is equal to 4 squared, is 16, times pi. And our units now are going to be centimeters squared. Or another way to think of these are square centimeters. So that's the area. The volume is going to be this area times the height. So the volume is going to be equal to 16 pi centimeters squared, times the height, times 8 centimeters."
Math,"And so, when you do multiplication, the associative property, you can kind of rearrange these things, and the commutative property. It doesn't matter what order you do it if it's all multiplication. So this is the same thing as 16 times 8. Let's see. 8 times 8 is 64. 16 times 8 is twice that. So it's going to be 128 pi. Now you have centimeter squared times centimeters. So that gives us centimeters cubed. Or 128 pi cubic centimeters. Remember, pi is just a number."
Math,"We write it as pi, because it's kind of a crazy, irrational number, that if you were to write it, you could never completely write pi. 3.14159 keeps going on, never a repeat. So we just leave it as pi. But if you wanted to figure it out, you can get a calculator. And this would be 3.14 roughly, times 128. So it would be close to 400 cubic centimeters."
Math,"Now, how would we find the surface area? How would we find the surface area of this figure over here? Well, part of the surface area of the two surfaces, the top and the bottom. So that would be part of the surface area. And then the bottom over here would also be part of the surface area. So if we're trying to find the surface area, it's definitely going to have both of these areas here. So it's going to have the 16 pi centimeters squared twice. This is 16 pi. This is 16 pi square centimeters."
Math,"So it's going to have 2 times 16 pi centimeters squared. I'll keep the units still. So that covers the top and the bottom of our soda can. And now we have to figure out the surface area of this thing that goes around. And the way I imagine it is, imagine if you're trying to wrap this thing with wrapping paper. So let me just draw a little dotted line here. So imagine if you were to cut it just like that. Cut the side of the soda can."
Math,"And if you were to unwind this thing that goes around it, what would you have. Well, you would have something. You would end up with a sheet of paper where this length right over here is the same thing as this length over here. And then it would be completely unwound. And then these two ends-- let me do it in magenta-- these two ends used to touch each other."
Math,"And-- I'm going to do it in a color that I haven't used yet, I'll do it in pink-- these two ends used to touch each other when it was all rolled together. And they used to touch each other right over there. So the length of this side and that side is going to be the same thing as the height of my cylinder. So this is going to be 8 centimeters. And then this over here is also going to be 8 centimeters. And so the question we need to ask ourselves is, what is going to be this dimension right over here."
Math,"And remember, that dimension is essentially, how far did we go around the cylinder. Well, if you think about it, that's going to be the exact same thing as the circumference of either the top or the bottom of the cylinder. So what is the circumference? The circumference of this circle right over here, which is the same thing as the circumference of that circle over there, it is 2 times the radius times pi. Or 2 pi times the radius. 2 pi times 4 centimeters, which is equal to 8 pi centimeters."
Math,"So this distance right over here is the circumference of either the top or the bottom of the cylinder. It's going to be 8 pi centimeters. So if you want to find the surface area of just the wrapping, just the part that goes around the cylinder, not the top or the bottom, when you unwind it, it's going to look like this rectangle. And so its area, the area of just that part, is going to be equal to 8 centimeters times 8 pi centimeters. So let me do it this way."
Math,"It's going to be 8 centimeters times 8 pi centimeters. And that's equal to 64 pi. 8 times 8 is 64. You have your pi centimeters squared. So when you want the surface area of the whole thing, you have the top, you have the bottom, we already threw those there. And then you want to find the area of the thing around. We just figured that out. So it's going to be plus 64 pi centimeters squared. And now we just have to calculate it. So this gives us 2 times 16 pi, is going to be equal to 32."
Math,"That is 32 pi centimeters squared, plus 64 pi. Let me scroll over to the right a little bit. Plus 64 pi centimeters squared. And then 32 plus 64 is 96 pi centimeters squared. So it's equal to 96 pi square centimeters, which is going to be a little bit over 300 square centimeters. And notice, when we did surface area, we got our answer in terms of square centimeters. That makes sense, because surface area, it's a two-dimensional measurement."
Math,"Think about how many square centimeters can we fit on the surface of the cylinder. When we did the volume, we got centimeters cubed, or cubic centimeters. And that's because we're trying to calculate how many one by one by one centimeter cubes can we fit inside of this structure. And so that's why it's cubic centimeters. Anyway, hopefully that clarifies things up a little bit.."
Math,"So I'm going to shade it a little bit so you can tell that it's three-dimensional. They're giving us the diameter. So if we go from one side of the sphere straight through the center of it. So we're imagining that we can see through the sphere. And we go straight through the centimeter, that distance right over there is 14 centimeters. Now, to find the volume of a sphere-- and we've proved this, or you will see a proof for this later when you learn calculus."
Math,"But the formula for the volume of a sphere is volume is equal to 4/3 pi r cubed, where r is the radius of the sphere. So they've given us the diameter. And just like for circles, the radius of the sphere is half of the diameter. So in this example, our radius is going to be 7 centimeters. And in fact, the sphere itself is the set of all points in three dimensions that is exactly the radius away from the center."
Math,"But with that out of the way, let's just apply this radius being 7 centimeters to this formula right over here. So we're going to have a volume is equal to 4/3 pi times 7 centimeters to the third power. So I'll do that in that pink color. So times 7 centimeters to the third power. And since it already involves pi, and you could approximate pi with 3.14. Some people even approximate it with 22/7. But we'll actually just get the calculator out to get the exact value for this volume."
Math,"So this is going to be-- so my volume is going to be 4 divided by 3. And then I don't want to just put a pi there, because that might interpret it as 4 divided by 3 pi. So 4 divided by 3 times pi, times 7 to the third power. In order of operations, it'll do the exponent before it does the multiplication, so this should work out. And the units are going to be in centimeters cubed or cubic centimeters. So we get 1,436. They don't tell us what to round it to."
Math,"So I'll just round it to the nearest 10th-- 1,436.8. So this is equal to 1,436.8 centimeters cubed. And we're done.."
Math,"And it would come to some point. So it looks something like that. You could consider this to be a cone, just like that. Or you could make it upside down if you're thinking of an ice cream cone. So it might look something like that. That's the top of it. And then it comes down like this. This also is those disposable cups of water you might see at some water coolers."
Math,And the important things that we need to think about when we want to know what the volume of a cone is we definitely want to know the radius of the base. So that's the radius of the base. Or here is the radius of the top part. You definitely want to know that radius. And you want to know the height of the cone. So let's call that h. I'll write over here. You could call this distance right over here h.
Math,"And the formula for the volume of a cone-- and it's interesting, because it's close to the formula for the volume of a cylinder in a very clean way, which is somewhat surprising. And that's what's neat about a lot of this three-dimensional geometry is that it's not as messy as you would think it would be. It is the area of the base. Well, what's the area of the base? The area of the base is going to be pi r squared. It's going to be pi r squared times the height."
Math,"And if you just multiplied the height times pi r squared, that would give you the volume of an entire cylinder that looks something like that. So this would give you this entire volume of the figure that looks like this, where its center of the top is the tip right over here. So if I just left it as pi r squared h or h times pi r squared, it's the volume of this entire can, this entire cylinder. But if you just want the cone, it's 1/3 of that. It is 1/3 of that."
Math,"And that's what I mean when I say it's surprisingly clean that this cone right over here is 1/3 the volume of this cylinder that is essentially-- you could think of this cylinder as bounding around it. Or if you wanted to rewrite this, you could write this as 1/3 times pi or pi/3 times hr squared. However you want to view it. The easy way I remember it? For me, the volume of a cylinder is very intuitive. You take the area of the base. And then you multiply that times the height."
Math,"And so the volume of a cone is just 1/3 of that. It's just 1/3 the volume of the bounding cylinder is one way to think about it. But let's just apply these numbers, just to make sure that it makes sense to us. So let's say that this is some type of a conical glass, the types that you might see at the water cooler. And let's say that we're told that it holds 131 cubic centimeters of water. And let's say that we're told that its height right over here-- I want to do that in a different color."
Math,"We're told that the height of this cone is 5 centimeters. And so given that, what is roughly the radius of the top of this glass? Let's just say to the nearest 10th of a centimeter. Well, we just once again have to apply the formula. The volume, which is 131 cubic centimeters, is going to be equal to 1/3 times pi times the height, which is 5 centimeters, times the radius squared. If we wanted to solve for the radius squared, we could just divide both sides by all of this business."
Math,"And we would get radius squared is equal to 131 centimeters to the third-- or 131 cubic centimeters, I should say. You divide by 1/3. That's the same thing as multiplying by 3. And then, of course, you're going to divide by pi. And you're going to divide by 5 centimeters. Now let's see if we can clean this up. Centimeters will cancel out with one of these centimeters. So you'll just be left with square centimeters only in the numerator. And then to solve for r, we could take the square root of both sides."
Math,"So we could say that r is going to be equal to the square root of-- 3 times 131 is 393 over 5 pi. So that's this part right over here. Once again, remember we can treat units just like algebraic quantities. The square root of centimeters squared-- well, that's just going to be centimeters, which is nice, because we want our units in centimeters. So let's get our calculator out to actually calculate this messy expression. Turn it on. Let's see."
Math,"Square root of 393 divided by 5 times pi is equal to 5-- well, it's pretty close. So to the nearest, it's pretty much 5 centimeters. So our radius is approximately equal to 5 centimeters, at least in this example.."
Math,"It's talking about taking a set of coordinates or a set of points, and then changing them into a different set of coordinates or a different set of points. For example, this right over here, this is a quadrilateral we've plotted it on the coordinate plane. This is a set of points, not just the four points that represent the vertices of the quadrilateral, but all the points along the sides too. There's a bunch of points along this."
Math,"You could argue there's an infinite, or there are an infinite number of points along this quadrilateral. This right over here, the point X equals 0, y equals negative four, this is a point on the quadrilateral. Now, we can apply a transformation to this, and the first one I'm going to show you is a translation, which just means moving all the points in the same direction, and the same amount in that same direction, and I'm using the Khan Academy translation widget to do it."
Math,"Let's translate, let's translate this, and I can do it by grabbing onto one of the vertices, and notice I've now shifted it to the right by two. Every point here, not just the orange points has shifted to the right by two. This one has shifted to the right by two, this point right over here has shifted to the right by two, every point has shifted in the same direction by the same amount, that's what a translation is."
Math,"Now, I've shifted, let's see if I put it here every point has shifted to the right one and up one, they've all shifted by the same amount in the same directions. That is a translation, but you could imagine a translation is not the only kind of transformation. In fact, there is an unlimited variation, there's an unlimited number different transformations. So, for example, I could do a rotation."
Math,"I have another set of points here that's represented by quadrilateral, I guess we could call it CD or BCDE, and I could rotate it, and I rotate it I would rotate it around the point. So for example, I could rotate it around the point D, so this is what I started with, if I, let me see if I can do this, I could rotate it like, actually let me see."
Math,"So if I start like this I could rotate it 90 degrees, I could rotate 90 degrees, so I could rotate it, I could rotate it like, that looks pretty close to a 90-degree rotation. So, every point that was on the original or in the original set of points I've now shifted it relative to that point that I'm rotating around. I've now rotated it 90 degrees, so this point has now mapped to this point over here."
Math,"This point has now mapped to this point over here, and I'm just picking the vertices because those are a little bit easier to think about. This point has mapped to this point. The point of rotation, actually, since D is actually the point of rotation that one actually has not shifted, and just 'til you get some terminology, the set of points after you apply the transformation this is called the image of the transformation."
Math,"So, I had quadrilateral BCDE, I applied a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation around the point D, and so this new set of points this is the image of our original quadrilateral after the transformation. I don't have to just, let me undo this, I don't have to rotate around just one of the points that are on the original set that are on our quadrilateral, I could rotate around, I could rotate around the origin. I could do something like that. Notice it's a different rotation now. It's a different rotation."
Math,"I could rotate around any point. Now let's look at another transformation, and that would be the notion of a reflection, and you know what reflection means in everyday life. You imagine the reflection of an image in a mirror or on the water, and that's exactly what we're going to do over here. If we reflect, we reflect across a line, so let me do that. This, what is this one, two, three, four, five, this not-irregular pentagon, let's reflect it."
Math,"To reflect it, let me actually, let me actually make a line like this. I could reflect it across a whole series of lines. Woops, let me see if I can, so let's reflect it across this. Now, what does it mean to reflect across something? One way I imagine is if this was, we're going to get its mirror image, and you imagine this as the line of symmetry that the image and the original shape they should be mirror images across this line we could see that. Let's do the reflection."
Math,"There you go, and you see we have a mirror image. This is this far away from the line. This, its corresponding point in the image is on the other side of the line but the same distance. This point over here is this distance from the line, and this point over here is the same distance but on the other side. Now, all of the transformations that I've just showed you, the translation, the reflection, the rotation, these are called rigid transformations."
Math,"Once again you could just think about what does rigid mean in everyday life? It means something that's not flexible. It means something that you can't stretch or scale up or scale down it kind of maintains its shape, and that's what rigid transformations are fundamentally about. If you want to think a little bit more mathematically, a rigid transformation is one in which lengths and angles are preserved."
Math,"You can see in this transformation right over here the distance between this point and this point, between points T and R, and the difference between their corresponding image points, that distance is the same. The angle here, angle R, T, Y, the measure of this angle over here, if you look at the corresponding angle in the image it's going to be the same angle. The same thing is true if you're doing a translation. You could imagine these are acting like rigid objects."
Math,"You can't stretch them, they're not flexible they're maintaining their shape. Now what would be examples of transformations that are not rigid transformations? Well you could imagine scaling things up and down. If I were to scale this out where it has maybe the angles are preserved, but the lengths aren't preserved that would not be a rigid transformation."
Math,"If I were to just stretch one side of it, or if I were to just pull this point while the other points stayed where they are I'd be distorting it or stretching it that would not be a rigid transformation. So hopefully this gets you, it's actually very, very interesting. When you use an art program, or actually you use a lot of computer graphics, or you play a video game, most of what the video game is doing is actually doing transformations."
Math,"Sometimes in two dimensions, sometimes in three dimensions, and once you get into more advanced math, especially things like linear algebra, there's a whole field that's really focused around transformations. In fact, some of the computers with really good graphics processors, a graphics processor is just a piece of hardware that is really good at performing mathematical transformations, so that you can immerse yourself in a 3D reality or whatever else. This is really really interesting stuff.."
Math,"This would be a translation. So the thing that I'm moving around is a translation of our original triangle. You could have a rotation. So that thing that I translated, I am now rotating it as you see right over there. And you can also have a reflection. The tool that I'm using doesn't make reflection too easy. But that's essentially flipping it over a line. But what we're going to talk about in this video is a non-rigid transformation."
Math,"And what makes something a rigid transformation is that lengths between points are reserved. But in a non-rigid transformation, those lengths do not need to be preserved. So for example, this rotated and translated triangle that I'm moving around right here, in fact I'm continuing to translate it as I talk. I can dilate it. And one way to think about dilation is that we're just scaling it down or scaling it up. So for example, here, I am scaling it down. That is a dilation. Or I can scale it up."
Math,"This is also a dilation or even going off of the graph paper. So the whole point here's just to appreciate that we don't just have the rigid transformations, we can have other types of transformations, and a dilation is one of them in your toolkit that you will often see, especially when you get introduced to the idea of transformation.."
Math,"We're gonna look at reflection, where you flip a figure over some type of a line. And we'll look at dilations, where you're essentially going to either shrink or expand some type of a figure. So with that out of the way, let's think about this question. What single transformation was applied to triangle A to get triangle B? So it looks like triangle A and triangle B, they're the same size, and what's really happened is that every one of these points has been shifted."
Math,"Or another way I could say it, they have all been translated a little bit to the right and up. And so, right like this, they have all been translated. So this right over here is clearly a translation. Let's do another example. What single transformation was applied to triangle A to get to triangle B? So if I look at these diagrams, this point seems to correspond with that one. This one corresponds with that one."
Math,"So it doesn't look like a straight translation because they would have been translated in different ways, so it's definitely not a straight translation. Let's think about it. Looks like there might be a rotation here. So maybe it looks like that point went over there. That point went over there. This point went over here, and so we could be rotating around some point right about here. And if you rotate around that point, you could get to a situation that looks like a triangle B."
Math,"And I don't know the exact point that we're rotating around, but this looks pretty clear, like a rotation. Let's do another example. What single transformation was applied to quadrilateral A to get to quadrilateral B? So let's see, it looks like this point corresponds to that point. And then this point corresponds to that point, and that point corresponds to that point, so they actually look like reflections of each other."
Math,"If you were to imagine some type of a mirror right over here, they're actually mirror images. This got flipped over the line, that got flipped over the line, and that got flipped over the line. So it's pretty clear that this right over here is a reflection. All right, let's do one more of these. What single transformation was applied to quadrilateral A to get to quadrilateral B? All right, so this looks like, so quadrilateral B is clearly bigger. So this is a non-rigid transformation."
Math,"The distance between corresponding points looks like it has increased. Now you might be saying, well, wouldn't that be, it looks like if you're making something bigger or smaller, that looks like a dilation. But it looks like this has been moved as well. Has it been translated? And the key here to realize is around, what is your center of dilation? So for example, if your center of dilation is, let's say, right over here, then all of these things are gonna be stretched that way."
Math,"And so this point might go to there, that point might go over there, this point might go over here, and then that point might go over here. So this is definitely a dilation, where you are, your center where everything is expanding from, is just outside of our trapezoid A.."
Math,"So we want to go five units to the left. So we start right over here. We're gonna go one, two, three, four, five units to the left, and then we're gonna go three units up. So that's going to be one, two, three. And so the image of point P, I guess, would show up right over here, after this translation described this way. Now, there are other ways that you could describe this translation. Here, we described it just in plain English, by five units to the left and three units up."
Math,"But you could, and this will look fancy, but, as we'll see, it's hopefully a pretty intuitive way to describe a translation. You could say, look, I'm gonna take some point with the coordinates x comma y. And the x coordinate tells me what's my coordinate in the horizontal direction to the left or the right. And so I want that to be five less. So I would say x minus five And what do we do to the y coordinate? Well, we're going to increase it by three. We're going to translate three units up, plus three."
Math,"So all this is saying is whatever x and y coordinates you have, this translation will make you take five from the x. That's what, meaning this is, this right over here, is five units to the left. And then this right over here, is saying three units up. Increase your y coordinate by three. Decrease your x coordinate by five. And so let's just test this out with this particular coordinate, with this particular point."
Math,"So at this point right over here, P has the coordinates, its x coordinate is three, and its y coordinate is negative four. So let's see how that works. If I have three comma negative four, and I want to apply this translation, what happens? Well, let me just do my coordinates. And so I started off with three and negative four, and I'm going to subtract five from the three. So subtract five here, we see that right over there, and we're going to add three to the y."
Math,"So notice, well, instead of an x, now I have a three. Instead of an x, now I have a three. Instead of a y, now I have a negative four. Instead of a y, now I have a negative four. And so another way of writing this, we're going from three comma negative four to three minus five is negative two, and negative four plus three is negative one. So what are the coordinates right over here? Well, the coordinate of this point is indeed negative two comma negative one."
Math,"So notice how this, I guess you could say this formula, the algebraic formula that shows how we map our coordinates, how it's able to draw the connection between the coordinates. And so you'll see questions where they'll tell you, hey, plot the image, and they'll describe it like this. Translate x units to the left or the right or three units up or down. You'll sometimes see it like this, but just recognize this is just saying just take your x and subtract five from it, which means move five to the left."
Math,"And this just means take your y coordinate and add three to it, which means move three up. And sometimes they'll ask you, hey, what's the new coordinate? Or sometimes they'll ask you to plot something like that, but just realize that it's all the same underlying idea.."
Math,"Every point here is gonna move positive eight in the x direction. Its x coordinate is going to increase by eight, or the corresponding point in the image, its x coordinate, is going to increase by eight, and the corresponding point in the image's y coordinate is going to decrease by one, so let's do that. And I'll focus on the vertices, whoops, let me drag that to the trash, I didn't mean to do that. I'm going to focus on the vertices well, that's just the easiest thing for my brain to worth with."
Math,"And actually, this is what the tool expects as well. So the point B, is going to move eight to the right, or its corresponding point in the image is going to have an x coordinate eight larger. So right now, the x coordinate is negative four, if you added eight to that, it would be positive four, and its y coordinate is going to be one lower. Right now, point B's y coordinate is eight, one lower than that is seven. So, in the image, the corresponding point of the image would going to be right over there."
Math,"And you see we moved eight to the right, and one down. Let's do that with point C. It's at x equals negative seven, if you move eight to the right, if you increase your x coordinate by eight, you're gonna move to x equals one, and then if you change your y coordinate by negative one, you're gonna move down one, then you're gonna get to that point right over there. Now, let's do it with point A. So point A's x coordinate is negative one."
Math,"If you add eight to it, it's going to be positive seven, and its current y coordinate is two. If you take one away from it, you're gonna get to a y coordinate of one. And so there you have it. Let's see, how do I connect these two? Oh, there you go, and we can check our answer. And we got it right. We have performed the translation.."
Math,"So I'm gonna start with the translation. So it says translate by, and this is gonna say so how much do we translate the x coordinates, and how much do we translate the y coordinates? Let's see, if I want to map, if I want to get point W to correspond to this point right over here, which it seems like it should, I would have to go from x equals two, to x equals negative five. So my x would have to decrease by seven, so let me type that in."
Math,"Negative seven, and then, let's see, on the y side, and we saw that, by just typing in negative seven, here we moved it to the left by seven. And now, in the y axis, I need to move it down by, let's see, one, two, three, four. So my y coordinates, I move it down by four. And let's see. What happens? And it looks like I was able to successfully translate it by translating x by negative seven, every point here, every point on this has been shifted to the left by seven, and has been shifted down by four."
Math,"And I was able to get onto this triangle. I was able to, through the translation, the image is now in kind of that target triangle that they asked me to map to, to translate to. We got it right.."
Math,"This is point P. It's being rotated around the origin (0,0) by 60 degrees. So if originally point P is right over here and we're rotating by positive 60 degrees, so that means we go counter clockwise by 60 degrees. So this looks like about 60 degrees right over here. One way to think about 60 degrees, is that that's 1/3 of 180 degrees. So does this look like 1/3 of 180 degrees? Remember, 180 degrees would be almost a full line."
Math,"So that indeed does look like 1/3 of 180 degrees, 60 degrees, it gets us to point C. And it looks like it's the same distance from the origin. We have just rotated by 60 degrees. Point D looks like it's more than 60 degree rotation, so I won't go with that one. All right, let's do one more of these. So we're told point P was rotated by negative 90 degrees. The center of rotation is indicated. Which point is the image of P? So once again, pause this video and try to think about it."
Math,"All right, so we have our center of rotation, this is our point P, and we're rotating by negative 90 degrees. So this means we are going clockwise. So we're going in that direction. And 90 degrees is easy to spot. It's a right angle. And so it would look like that and it looks like it is getting us right to point A. So this is a negative 90 degree rotation right over here. Gets us to point A.."
Math,"So I'm just gonna think about how did each of these points have to be rotated to go from A to A-prime, or B to B-prime, or from C to C-prime? So let's just start with A. So this is where A starts. Remember we're rotating about the origin. That's why I'm drawing this line from the origin to A. And where does it get rotated to? Well, it gets rotated to right over here. So the rotation is going in the counterclockwise direction, so it's going to have a positive angle."
Math,"So we can rule out these two right over here. And the key question is, is this 30 degrees or 60 degrees? And there's a bunch of ways that you could think about it. One, 60 degrees would be 2/3 of a right angle, while 30 degrees would be 1/3 of a right angle. A right angle would look something like this. So this looks much more like 2/3 of a right angle, so I'll go with 60 degrees. Another way to think about is that 60 degrees is 1/3 of 180 degrees, which this also looks like right over here."
Math,"And if you do that with any of the points, you would see a similar thing. So just looking at A to A-prime makes me feel good that this was a 60-degree rotation. Let's do another example. So we are told quadrilateral A-prime, B-prime, C-prime, D-prime, in red here, is the image of quadrilateral ABCD, in blue here, under rotation about point Q. Determine the angle of rotation. So once again, pause this video, and see if you can figure it out. Well, I'm gonna tackle this the same way."
Math,"I don't have a coordinate plane here, but it's the same notion. I can take some initial point and then look at its image and think about, well, how much did I have to rotate it? I could do B to B-prime, although this might be a little bit too close. So I'm going from B to, let me do a new color here, just 'cause this color is too close to, I'll use black, so we're going from B to B-prime right over here. We are going clockwise, so it's going to be a negative rotation. So we can rule that and that out."
Math,"And it looks like a right angle. This looks like a right angle, so I feel good about picking negative 90 degrees. We could try another point and feel good that that also meets that negative 90 degrees. Let's say D to D-prime. So this is where D is initially. This is where D is, and this is where D-prime is. And once again, we are moving clockwise, so it's a negative rotation. And this looks like a right angle, definitely more like a right angle than a 60-degree angle."
Math,"And so this would be negative 90 degrees, definitely feel good about that.."
Math,"And so its reflection is going to be four units to the left of l. So if we go one, two, three, four, that would be the image of point A. We could maybe denote that as A prime. So if you're doing this on the Khan Academy exercise, you would actually just click on a point right over there, and it would show up. But this would be the reflection of point A across the line l. Let's do another example. So here we're asked plot the image of point B under a reflection across the x-axis."
Math,"Alright, so this is point B, and we're going to reflect it across the x-axis right over here. So to go from B to the x-axis, it's exactly five units below the x-axis. One, two, three, four, five. So if we were to reflect across the x-axis, essentially create its mirror image, it's going to be five units above the x-axis. One, two, three, four, five. So that's where the image would be. Maybe we could denote that with a B prime. We are reflecting across the x-axis. Let's do another example."
Math,"So here they tell us point C prime is the image of C, which is at the coordinates negative four comma negative two, under a reflection across the y-axis. What are the coordinates of C prime? So pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. So there's several ways to approach it. It doesn't hurt to do a quick visual diagram. So that could be my x-axis. This would be my y-axis. And it's the point negative four comma negative two, so that might look like this. Negative four, negative two."
Math,"So this is the point C right over here. And we wanna reflect across the y-axis. So we wanna reflect across the y-axis, which I am coloring it in red right over here. So let's see. The point C is four to the left of the y-axis. So its reflection is going to be four to the right of the y-axis. So let me do it like this. So instead of being four to the left, we wanna go four to the right, so plus four. So where would that put our C prime? So our C prime would be right over there."
Math,"And what would its coordinates be? Well, it would have the same y-coordinate, so C prime would have a y-coordinate of negative two. But what would its x-coordinate be? Well, instead of it being negative four, it gets flipped over the y-axis, so now it's gonna have a x-coordinate of positive four. So the coordinates here would be four comma negative two. Four comma negative two. You might've been able to do this in your head."
Math,"Although, for me, even if I try to do it in my head, I would still have this visualization going on in my head. Negative four comma negative two. I'm sitting there in the third quadrant. If I'm flipping over the y-axis, my y-coordinate wouldn't change, but my x-coordinate would become the opposite and I would end up in the fourth quadrant, and that's exactly what happened."
Math,"Y-coordinate did not change, but then my x-coordinate, since I'm flipping over the y-axis, it became the negative of this, so the opposite of negative four which is positive four.."
Math,"And we have our little tool here on Khan Academy where we can construct a quadrilateral. And we need to construct a reflection of triangle A, And so what we can do is, let me scroll down a little bit. So we can see the entire coordinate axis. We want to find the reflection across the X axis. So I'm gonna reflect point by point. And actually, let me just move this whole thing down here so that we can so that we can see what is going on a little bit clearer."
Math,"So let's just first reflect point let me move this a little bit out of the way. So let's first reflect Point A. So we're gonna reflect across the X axis. A is four units above the X axis. One, two, three, four. So, its image, A prime we could say, would be four units below the X axis. So, one, two, three, four. So let's make this right over here A, A prime. I'm having trouble putting the let's see if I move these other characters around. Okay, there you go. So this is gonna be my A prime. Now let me try B."
Math,"B is two units above the X axis. So B prime is gonna have the same X coordinate but it's gonna be two units below the X axis. So let's make this our B. So this is our B right over here. Now let's make this our C. C, right here, has the X coordinate of negative five. A d a Y coordinate of negative four. Now C prime would have the same X coordinate but instead of being four units below the X axis, it will be four units above the X axis. So it would have the coordinates negative five comma positive four."
Math,"So this is going to be our C here. So this goes to negative five, one, two, three, positive four. And then last but not least, D. And so let's see, D right now is at negative two comma negative one. If we reflect across the X axis instead of being one unit below the X axis, we'll be one unit above the X axis. And we'll keep our X coordinate of negative two. And so, there you have it. We have constructed the reflection of ABCD across the X axis."
Math,"And what's interesting about this example is that, the original quadrilateral is on top of the X axis. So you an kind of see this top part of the quadrilateral gets reflected below it. And this bottom part of the quadrilateral gets reflected above it. And then you can see that indeed do they indeed do look like reflections flipped over the X axis.."
Math,"But let's see if we can actually construct a horizontal line where it does actually look like the line of reflection. So let's see, C and C prime, how far apart are they from each other? So if we go one, two, three, four, five, six down. So they are six apart. So let's see if we just put this three above C prime and three below C, let's see if this horizontal line works as a line of reflection. So C, or C prime is definitely the reflection of C across this line."
Math,"C is exactly three units above it, and C prime is exactly three units below it. Let's see if it works for A and A prime. A is one, two, three, four, five units above it. A prime is one, two, three, four, five units below it. So that's looking good. Now let's just check out B. So B, we can see it's at the y-coordinate here is seven. This line right over here is y is equal to one."
Math,"And so what we would have here is, let's see, this looks like it's six units above this line, and B prime is six units below the line. So this indeed works. We've just constructed the line of reflection that reflects the blue triangle, triangle ABC, onto triangle A prime B prime C prime.."
Math,"And I encourage you to pause this video and see if you can figure out the answers to these questions on your own before I work through them. So the first question they say is well, what's A prime C prime? This is really what's the length of segment A prime C prime? So they want the length of this right over here. How do we figure that out? Well, the key realization here is a reflection is a rigid transformation. Rigid transformation, which is a very fancy word."
Math,"But it's really just saying that it's a transformation where the length between corresponding points don't change. If we're talking about a shape like a triangle, the angle measures won't change, the perimeter won't change, and the area won't change. So we're gonna use the fact that the length between corresponding points won't change. So the length between A prime and C prime is gonna be the same as the length between A and C."
Math,"So A prime C prime is going to be equal to AC, which is equal to they tell us right over there. That's this corresponding side of the triangle. That has a length of three. So we answered the first question. And maybe that gave you a good clue. And so I encourage you to keep pausing the video when you feel like you can have a go at it. Alright, the next question is what is the measure of angle B prime? So that's this angle right over here. And we're gonna use the exact same property."
Math,"Angle B prime corresponds to angle B. It underwent a rigid transformation of a reflection. This would also be true if we had a translation, or if we had a rotation. And so right over here, the measure of angle B prime would be the same as the measure of angle B. But what is that going to be equal to? Well, we can use the fact that if we call that measure, let's just call that X. X plus 53 degrees, we'll do it all in degrees, plus 90 degrees, this right angle here."
Math,"Well, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. And so what do we have? We could subtract, let's see, 53 plus 90 is X, plus 143 degrees is equal to 180 degrees. And so subtract 143 degrees from both sides. You will get X is equal to, let's see, 180 minus 40 would be 40. 80 minus 43 would be 37 degrees. X is equal to 37 degrees, so that is 37 degrees. If that's 37 degrees, then this is also going to be 37 degrees."
Math,"Next, they ask us what is the area of triangle ABC? Well, it's gonna have the same area as A prime B prime C prime. And so a couple of ways we could think about it. We could try to find the area of A prime B prime C prime based on the fact that we already know that this length is three and this is a right triangle. Or we can use the fact that this length right over here, four, from A prime to B prime is gonna be the same thing as this length right over here, from A prime to B prime, which is four."
Math,"And so the area of this triangle, especially this is a right triangle, it's quite straightforward, it's the base times the height times 1/2. So this area is gonna be 1/2 times the base, four, times the height, three, which is equal to 1/2 of 12, which is equal to six square units. And then last but not least, what's the perimeter of triangle A prime B prime C prime? Well, here we just used the Pythagorean Theorem to figure out the length of this hypotenuse."
Math,"And we know that this is a length of three based on the whole rigid transformation and lengths are preserved. And so you might immediately recognize that if you have a right triangle where one side is three and the other side is four, that the hypotenuse is five. Three four five triangles. Or you could just the Pythagorean Theorem. You say three squared plus four squared, four squared is equal to let's just say the hypotenuse squared. Well, three squared plus four squared, that's nine plus 16."
Math,"25 is equal to the hypotenuse squared. And so the hypotenuse right over here will be equal to five. And so they're not asking us the length of the hypotenuse. They wanna know the perimeter. So it's gonna be four plus three plus five, which is equal to 12. The perimeter of either of those triangles, because it's just one's the image of the other under a rigid transformation. They're gonna have the same perimeter, the same area. The perimeter of either of the triangles is 12."
Math,The area of either of the triangles is six. And we're done..
Math,"So for example, let's say we take this circle A, it's centered at Point A. And we were to rotate it around Point P. Point P is the center of rotation. And just for the sake of argument we rotate it clockwise a certain angle. So let's say we end up right over so we're gonna rotate that way. And let's say our center ends up right over here. So our new circle, the image after the rotation might look something like this. And I'm hand drawing it."
Math,"So you got to forgive that it's not that well hand drawn of a circle. But the circle might look something like this. And so, the clear things that are preserved or maybe it's not so clear, we're gonna hope we make them clear right now. Things that are preserved under a rigid transformation like this rotation right over here. This is clearly a rotation. Things that are preserved well, you have things like the radius of the circle. The radius length, I could say, to be more particular."
Math,"The radius here is two. The radius here is also is also two, right over there. You have things like the perimeter. Well, if the radius is preserved the perimeter of a circle which we call a circumference well, that's just a function of the radius. We're talking about two times pi times the radius. So the perimeter, of course, is going to be preserved. In fact, that follows from the fact that the length of the radius is preserved."
Math,"And of course, if the radius is preserved and then the area is also going to be preserved. The area is just pi times the radius squared. So they have the same radius. They're gonna have all of these in common. And you could also that feels intuitively right. So what is not preserved? Not preserved. And this is in general true of rigid transformations is that they will preserve the distance between corresponding points if we're transforming a shape they'll preserve things like perimeter and area."
Math,"And this case, I can set a perimeter. I can say circumference. Circumference. So they'll preserve things like that. They'll preserve angles. We don't have clear angles in this picture. But, they'll preserve things like angles. But what they won't preserve is the coordinates. Coordinates corresponding points. They might sometimes, but not always. So for example, the coordinate of the center here is for sure, going to change. We go from the coordinate negative three comma zero."
Math,"To here we went to the coordinate we went to the coordinate negative one comma two. So the coordinates are not preserved. Coordinates of the center. Let's do another example with a non-circular shape. And we'll do a different type of transformation. In this situation let us do a reflection. So, we have a quadrilateral here. Quadrilateral ABCD. And we want to think about what is preserved, or not preserved as we do a reflection across the line L. So let me write that down."
Math,We're gonna have a reflection in this situation. And we can even think about this without even doing the reflection ourselves. But let's just do the reflection really fast. So we're reflecting across the line XYZ equal to X. So what it essentially does to the coordinates is it swaps the X and Y coordinates. But you don't have to know that for the sake of this video. B prime would be right over here. A prime would be right over there. D prime would be right over here.
Math,"And since C is right on the line now its image, C prime, won't change. And so our new when we reflect over the line L. And you don't have to know for the sake of this video, exactly how I did that fairly quickly. I really just want you to see what the reflection looks like. The real appreciation here is think about, well, what happens with rigid transformations. So, it's gonna look something like this. The reflection. The reflection looks something like this."
Math,"So what's preserved? And in general, this is good to know for any rigid transformation what's preserved. Well, side lengths. That's actually one way that we even use to define what a rigid transformation is. A transformation that preserves the lengths between corresponding points. Angle measures. Angle measures. So, for example, this angle here, the angle A, is gonna be the same as the angle A prime over here."
Math,"Side lengths, the distance between A and B is going to be the same as the distance between A prime and B prime. Perimeter. If you have the same side lengths and the same angles, the perimeter and area are also going to be preserved. Just like we saw with the rotation example. These are rigid transformations. These are the types of things that are preserved. Well, what is not preserved? Not preserved. And this just goes back to the example we just looked at. Well, coordinates are not preserved."
Math,"So as we see, the image of A A prime has different coordinates than A. B prime has different coordinates than B. C prime, in this case, happens to have the same coordinates as C because C happens to sit on our, the line that we're reflecting over. But D prime definitely does not have the same coordinates as D. So, most or let me say, coordinates of AB Coordinates D not preserved. After transformation, or their images don't have the same coordinates. transformation."
Math,"The one coordinate that happened to be preserved here coordinates. Because it was right on the line of reflection. And you can also look at other properties so how it might relate how different segments might relate to lines that would not be that were not being transformed. So, for example, right over here before transformation, CD is parallel to the Y axis. You see this right over here. But after the transformation C prime D prime. So this could be C prime D prime is no longer parallel to the Y axis."
Math,"In fact, now it is parallel to the X axis. So, when you have the relationship to things outside of the things we're transformed that relationship might not. Those relationships may no longer be true after the transformation.."
Math,"Which of the following sequences of transformations maps triangle PQR onto triangle ABC? So we have four different sequences of transformations, and so why don't you pause this video and figure out which of these actually does map triangle PQR, so this is PQR, onto ABC, and it could be more than one of these. So pause this video and have a go at that. All right, now let's do this together. So let's first think about Sequence A, and I will do Sequence A in this purple color."
Math,"So remember, we're starting with triangle PQR. So first it says a rotation 90 degrees about the point, about the point R, so let's do that. And then we'll do the rest of this sequence. So if we rotate this 90 degrees, so one way to think about it is, a line like that is then going to be like that. So we're going to go like that. And so R is going to stay where it is. You're rotating about it. But P is now going to be right over here."
Math,"One way to think about it is to go from R to P, we went down one and three to the right. Now when you do the rotation, you're going to go to the right one and then up three. So P is going to be there and you can see that. That's the rotation. So that side will look like this. So that is P. And then Q is going to go right over here. It's going to, once again, also do a 90-degree rotation about R. And so after you do the 90-degree rotation, PQR is going to look like this. So that is Q."
Math,"So we've done that first part. Then a translation six units to the left and seven units up. So each of these points are going to go six units to the left and seven up. So if we take point P, six to the left, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven units up, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. It'll put it right over there, so that is point P. If we take point R, we take six units to the left, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven up, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
Math,"It gets us right over there. And then point Q, if we go six units to the left, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven up is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Puts us right over there. So this looks like it worked. Sequence A is good. It maps PQR onto ABC. This last one isn't an R, this is a Q right over here. So that worked, Sequence A. Now let's work on Sequence B. I'll do this in different color. A translation eight units to the left and three up, so let's do that first."
Math,"So if we take point Q eight to the left and three up, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, three up, one, two, three. So this'll be my red Q for now. And now if I do this point R, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Let me make sure I did that right. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, three up, one, two, three. So my new R is going to be there."
Math,"And then last but not least, point P, eight to the left, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, three up, one, two, three, goes right there. So just that translation will get us to this point. It'll get us to that point, so we're clearly not done mapping yet, but there's more transformation to be done. So it looks something like that. Says then a reflection over the horizontal line through point A. So point A is right over here. The horizontal line is right like that."
Math,"So if I were to reflect, point A wouldn't change. Point R right now is three below that horizontal line. Point R will then be three above that horizontal line. So point R will then go right over there. Just from that, I can see that this sequence of transformations is not going to work. It's putting R in the wrong place. So I'm going to rule out Sequence B. Sequence C, let me do that with another color. I don't know, I will do it with this orange color. A reflection over the vertical point through point Q."
Math,"Sorry, a reflection over the vertical line through point Q. So let me do that. So the vertical line through point Q looks like this, just gonna draw that vertical line. So if you reflect it, Q is going to be, it's going to stay in place. R is one to the right of that, so now it's going to be one to the left once you do the reflection. And point P is four to the right, so now it's gonna be four to the left. One, two, three, four, so P is going to be there after the reflection."
Math,"And so it's going to look something like this after that first transformation, and this is getting a little bit messy. But this is what you'll probably have to go through as well, so I'll go through it with you. All right, so we did that first part, the reflection. Then a translation four to the left and seven units up. So four to the left and seven up. So let me try that. So four to the left, one, two, three, four, seven up, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So it's putting Q right over here."
Math,"I'm already suspicious of it because Sequence A worked where we put P right over there. So I'm already suspicious of this, but let's keep trying. So four to the left and seven up, one, two, three, four, seven up, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So R is going to the same place as Sequence A put it. And then point P, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Actually, it worked. So it works because this is actually an isosceles triangle. And so this one actually worked out."
Math,"We were able to map PQR onto ABC with Sequence C. So I like, I like this one as well. And then last but not least, let's try Sequence D. I'll do that in black so that we can see it. So first we do a translation eight units to the left and three up. Eight to the left and three up. So we'll start here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, three up, one, two, three. So I'll put my black Q right over there."
Math,"So eight to the left, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, three up, one, two, three. I'll put my black R right over there. It's actually exactly what we did in Sequence B the first time. So P is going to show up right over there. So after that translation, sequence, that first translation in Sequence D gets us right over there. Then it says a rotation -270 degrees about point A. So this is point A right over here. And -270 degrees, it's negative, so it's going to go clockwise."
Math,"And let's see, 180 degrees, let's say if we were to take this line right over here, if we were to go 180 degrees, it would go to this line like that. And then if you were to go another 90 degrees, it actually does look like it would, it would map onto that. So this is actually looking pretty good."
Math,"If you were to, this line right over here will then, if you go -270 degrees, will map onto this right over here, and then that point R will kinda go along for the ride is one way to think about it, and so it'll go right over there as well. So I'm actually liking Sequence D as well. So all of these work except for Sequence B.."
Math,"So however far A is from point P, it's going to be three times further under the dilation. Three times further in the same direction. So how do we think about that? Well, one way to think about it is to go from P to A you have to go one down and two to the left, so minus one and minus two. And so if you dilate it with a factor of three, then you're going to want to go three times as far down. So minus three, and three times as far to the left, so you'll go minus six."
Math,"So one, let me do this, so negative one, negative two, negative three, negative four, negative five, negative six. So you will end up right over there. And you can even see it, that this is indeed three times as far from P in the same direction. So we could call the image of point A, maybe we call that A prime, and so there you have it. It has been dilated with a scale factor of three. And so you might be saying, wait, I'm used to dilating being stretching or scaling."
Math,"How have I stretched or scaled something? Well imagine a bunch of points here that represents some type of picture and if you push them all three times further from point P, which you could do as your center of dilation, then you would expand the size of your picture by a scale factor of three. Let's do another example with a point."
Math,"So, here we're told, plot the image of point A under a dilation about the origin with a scale factor of 1/3 so first of all we don't even see the point A here, so it's actually below the fold. So let's see, there we go, that's our point A. We want it to be about the origin, so about the point zero zero. This is what we want to, the dilation about the origin with a scale factor of 1/3, scale is 1/3. Scale factor, I should say."
Math,"So how do we do this? Well here, however far A is from the origin we now want to be in the same direction, but 1/3 as far. So one way to think about it, to go from the origin to A you have to go six down and three to the right. So 1/3 of that would be two down and one to the right. Two is 1/3 of six and one is 1/3 of three, so you will end up right over here. That would be our A prime."
Math,"So notice, you are 1/3 away from the origin as we were before because once again, this is point A under a dilation about the origin with a scale factor of 1/3.."
Math,"So for example we could look at the distance between point A and point B right over here. What is our change in y? Our change in, or even what is our distance? Our change in y is our distance because we don't have a change in x. Well this is one, two, three, four, five, six. So this length right over here is equal to six."
Math,"Now what about the corresponding side from A' to B'? Well this length right over here is equal to two, and so you can see we went from having a length of six to a length of two, so you would have to multiply by 1/3. So our scale factor right over here is 1/3. Now you might be saying okay that was pretty straightforward because we had a very clear, you could just see the distance between A and B."
Math,"How would you do it if you didn't have a vertical or a horizontal line? Well one way to think about it is, the changes in y and the changes in x would scale accordingly. So if you looked at the distance between point A and point E, our change in y is negative three right over here, and our change in x is positive three right over here. And you can see over here between A' and E', our change in y is negative one, which is 1/3 of negative three, and our change in x is one, which is 1/3 of three."
Math,"So once again you see our scale factor being 1/3. Let's do another example. So we are told that pentagon A'B'C'D'E' is the image, and they don't, they haven't drawn that here, is the image of pentagon ABCDE under a dilation with a scale factor of 5/2. So they're giving us our scale factor. What is the length of segment A'E'? So as I was mentioning while I read it, they didn't actually draw this one out."
Math,"So how do we figure out the length of a segment? Well I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it. Well they give us the scale factor, and so what it tells us, the scale factor is 5/2. That means that the corresponding lengths will change by a factor of 5/2. So to figure out the length of segment A'E', this is going to be, you could think of it as the image of segment AE. And so you can see that the length of AE is equal to two."
Math,"And so the length of A'E' is going to be equal to AE which is two times the scale factor, times 5/2, this is our scale factor right over here. And of course what's two times 5/2? Well it is going to be equal to five, five of these units right over here. So in this case we didn't even have to draw A'B'C'D'E'. In fact they haven't even given us enough information. I could draw the scale of that, but I actually don't know where to put it because they didn't even give us our center of dilation."
Math,"But we know that corresponding sides, or the lengths between corresponding points, are going to be scaled by the scale factor. Now with that in mind, let's do another example. So we are told that triangle A'B'C', which they depicted right over here, is the image of triangle ABC, which they did not depict, under a dilation with a scale factor of two."
Math,"What is the length of segment AB? Once again they haven't drawn AB here, how do we figure it out? Well it's gonna be a similar way as the last example, but here they've given us the image and they didn't give us the original. So how do we do it? Well the key, and pause the video again and try to do it on your own."
Math,"Well the key realization here is that if you take the length of segment AB and you were to multiply by the scale factor, so you multiply it by two, then you're going to get the length of segment A'B'. The image's length is equal to the scale factor times the corresponding length on our original triangle. So what is the length of A'B'? Well this is straightforward to figure out. It is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
Math,"So this right over here is eight, so we have two times the length of segment AB is equal to eight. And then you get the length of segment AB, just divide both sides by two, is equal to four. And we're done.."
Math,"So if we're centering a dilation at P and its scale factor is 1 and 2/3, that means once we perform the dilation, every point is going to be 1 and 2/3 times as far away from P. Well P is 0 away from P, so its image is still going to be at P. So let's put that point right over there. Now point C is going to be 1 and 2/3 times as far as it is right now. So let's see, right now it is 6 away. It's at negative 3. And P, its x-coordinate is the same, but in the y direction, P is at 3. C is at negative 3."
Math,"So it's 6 less. We want to be 1 and 2/3 times as far away. So what's 1 and 2/3 of 6? Well, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so it's going to be 6 plus 4. You're going to be 10 away. So 3 minus 10, that gets us to negative 7. So that gets us right over there. Now point A, right now it is 3 more in the horizontal direction than point P's x-coordinate. So we want to go 1 and 2/3 as far. So what is 1 and 2/3 times 3? Well that's going to be 3 plus 2/3 of 3, which is another 2. So that's going to be 5."
Math,"So we're going to get right over there. Then we could complete the rectangle. And notice point B is now 1 and 2/3 times as far in the horizontal direction. It was 3 away in the horizontal direction, now it is 5 away from P's x-coordinate. And in the vertical direction, in the y direction, it was 6 below P's y-coordinate. Now it is 1 and 2/3 times as far. It is 10 below P's y-coordinate. So then let's answer these questions. The length of segment AB-- well, we already saw that."
Math,"That is, we're going from 3 to negative 3. That is 6 units long. And its image, well it's 1 and 2/3 as long. We see it over here. We're going from 3 to negative 7. 3 minus negative 7 is 10. It is 10 units long. We got it right.."
Math,"So one way to think about it is the points that will correspond to points D, E, and F are going to be half as far away from the origin, because our scale factor is 1/2 in either direction. So for example, let's think about point D first. Point D is at negative 8. So if we have a scale factor of 1/2, what point D will map to is going to be at negative 4 on the x direction. And on the y direction, D is at negative 9, so this is going to be at negative 4.5. Half of that."
Math,"So that is going to be right over there. That's where point D is going to be, or the image of point D after the scaling. Now let's think about point E. E is 2 more than the origin in the x direction. So it's only going to be 1 more once we scale it by 1/2. And it's 7 more in the y direction, so it's going to be at 3 and 1/2. 7 times 1/2 is 3 and 1/2. So we're going to stick it right over there. And then finally F, its x-coordinate is 6 more than the origin. Its y-coordinate is 6 less."
Math,"So its image after scaling is going to be 3 more in the x direction and 3 less in the y direction. So it's going to be right over there. So we've plotted the images of the points. So if you were to connect these points, you would essentially have dilated down DEF, and your center of dilation would be the origin. So let's just write these coordinates. Point D-- and point D, remember, was the point negative 8, negative 9. That's going to map to-- take 1/2 of each of those. So negative 4 and negative 4.5."
Math,"Point E maps to-- well, E was at 2, 7. So it maps to 1, 3.5. And then finally, point F was at 6, negative 6, so it maps to 3, negative 3. So the important thing to recognize is the center of our dilation was the origin. So in each dimension, in the x direction or in the y direction, we just halved the distance from the origin, because the scale factor was 1/2. We got it right.."
Math,"We can see under an arbitrary dilation here, the coordinates are not preserved. The point that corresponds to D now has a different coordinate. The vertices, the vertex that corresponds to A now has different coordinates. Same thing for B and C. The corresponding points after the dilation now sit on a different part of the coordinate plane. So in this case, the coordinates of the vertices are not preserved. Now, the next question, let me go back to where we were."
Math,"So the next question, the corresponding line segments after dilation, are they sitting on the same line and so let me dilate again and so you can see if you consider this point B prime 'cause it corresponds to point B, the segment B prime C prime, this does not sit on the same line as BC but the segment D prime, the corresponding line segment to line segment AD, that does sit on the same line and if you think about why that is, well, if we originally draw a line that, if we look at the line that contains segment AD, it also goes through point P and so as we expand out, this segment right over here is going to expand and shift outward along the same lines but that's not going to be true of these other segments because they don't, because the point P does not sit on the line that those segments sit on and so let's just expand it again so you see that right over there."
Math,"Now, the next question, are angle measures preserved? Well, it looks like they are and this is one of the things that is true about a dilation is that you're going to preserve angle measures. This angle is still a right angle. This angle here, I guess you can call it angle, the measure of angle B is the same as the measure of angle B prime and you can see it with all of these points right over there and then the last question."
Math,"Are side lengths, perimeter and area preserved? Well, we can immediately see as we dilate outwards, for example, the segment corresponding to AD has gotten longer. In fact, if we dilate outwards, all of the segments, the corresponding segments are getting larger and if they're all getting larger then the perimeter's getting larger and the area's getting larger. Likewise, if we dilate in like this, they're all getting smaller. So side lengths, perimeter and area are not preserved."
Math,"Now, let's ask the same questions with another dilation and this is going to be interesting because we're going to look at a dilation that is centered at one of the vertices of our shape. So let me scroll down here and so I have the same tool again and now here we have a triangle, triangle ABC and we're gonna dilate about point C. So first of all, do we think the vertices, the coordinates of the vertices are going to be preserved? Let's dilate out. Well, you can see point C is preserved."
Math,"When it gets mapped after the dilation, it sits in the exact same place but the things that correspond to A and B are not preserved. You could call this A prime and this definitely has different coordinates than A and B prime definitely has different coordinates than B. Now, what about corresponding line segments? Are they on the same line? Well, some of them are and some of them aren't."
Math,"So for example, when we dilate, so let's look at the segment AC and the segment BC, when we dilate, we can see, whoops, when we dilate, we can see the corresponding segments, you could call this A prime C prime or B prime C prime, do still sit on that same line and that's because the point that we are dilating about, point C, sat on those original segments. So we're essentially just lengthening out on the point that is not the center of dilation."
Math,"We're lengthening out away from it or if the dilation is going in, we would be shortening along that same line but some of the segments are not overlapping on the same line. So for example, A prime B prime does not sit along the same line as AB. Now, what about the angle measures? Well, we already talked about it. Angle measures are preserved under dilations. The measure of angle C here, this is the exact same angle and so is the measure of angle you could call this A prime and B prime right over here."
Math,"And then finally, what about side lengths? Well, you can clearly see that when I dilate out, my side lengths increase or if I dilate in, my side lengths decrease and so side lengths are not preserved and if side lengths are not preserved then the perimeter is not preserved and also the area is not preserved. You could view area as a function of the side lengths. As we dilate out like this, the perimeter grows and so does the area. If we dilate in like this, the perimeter shrinks and so does the area.."
Math,"So what I want you to do is pause this video and think about, is Kason correct that they are not congruent, because you can not map ABC, triangle ABC onto triangle GFE with rigid transformations? All right, so the way I think about it, he was able to do the rotation that got us right over here, so it is rotation about point C, and so this point right over here, let me make sure I get this right, this would've become B prime, and then this is A prime, and then C is mapped to itself, so C is equal to C prime."
Math,"But he's not done, there's another rigid transformation he could do, and that would be a reflection about the line FG. So if he reflects about the line FG, then this point is going to be mapped to point E, just like that. And then if you did that, you would see that there is a series of rigid transformations that maps triangle ABC onto triangle GFE. So Kason is not correct, he missed one more transformation he could've done, which is a reflection.."
Math,"This is circle M, this circle right over here. It looks like at first, she translates it. The center goes from this point to this point here. After the translation, we have the circle right over here. Then she dilates it. The center of dilation looks like it is point N. She dilates it with some type of a scale factor in order to map it exactly onto N. That all seems right."
Math,"Brenda concluded, ""I was able to map circle M ""onto circle N using a sequence ""of rigid transformations, ""so the figures are congruent."" Is she correct? Pause this video and think about that. Let's work on this together. She was able to map circle M onto circle N using a sequence of transformations. She did a translation and then a dilation. Those are all transformations, but they are not all rigid transformations. I'll put a question mark right over there. A translation is a rigid transformation."
Math,"Remember, rigid transformations are ones that preserve distances, preserve angle measures, preserve lengths, while a dilation is not a rigid transformation. As you can see very clearly, it is not preserving lengths. It is not, for example, preserving the radius of the circle. In order for two figures to be congruent, the mapping has to be only with rigid transformations."
Math,"Because she used a dilation, in fact, you have to use a dilation if you wanna be able to map M onto N because they have different radii, then she's not correct. These are not congruent figures. She cannot make this conclusion.."
Math,"What error if any, did Shui make in her conclusion? Pause this video and try to figure this out on your own. All right, so let's just remind ourselves one definition of similarity that we often use on geometry class, and that's two figures are similar is if you can through a series of rigid transformations and dilations, if you can map one figure onto the other. Now, when I look at these two figures, you could try to do something. You could say okay, let me shift it so that K gets mapped onto H."
Math,"And if you did that, it looks like L would get mapped onto G. But these sides KN and LM right over here, they seem a good bit longer. So, and then if you try to dilate it down so that the length of KN is the same as the length of HI well then the lengths of KL and GH would be different. So it doesn't seem like you could do this. So it is strange that Shui concluded that they are similar. So let's find the mistake."
Math,"I'm already, I'll already rule out C, that it's a correct conclusion 'cause I don't think they are similar. So let's see. Is the error that a rigid transformation, a translation would map HG onto KL? Yep, we just talked about that. HG can be mapped onto KL so the quadrilaterals are congruent, not similar. Oh, choice A is making an even stronger statement because anything that is congruent is going to be similar. You actually can't have something that's congruent and not similar."
Math,"And so, choice A does not make any sense. So our deductive reasoning tells us it's probably choice B. But let's just read it. It's impossible to map quadrilateral GHIJ onto quadrilateral LKNM using only rigid transformations and dilations so the figures are not similar. Yeah, that's right. You could try, you could map HG onto KL, but then segment IJ would look something like this, IJ would go right over here."
Math,"And then, if you tried to dilate it, so that the length of HI and GJ matched KN or LM, then you're gonna make HG bigger as well. So, you're never gonna be able to map them onto each other even if you can use dilations. So I like choice B.."
Math,"So for example, B right over here has the same y-coordinate as P, but its x-coordinate is three more. So we want to be twice as far. So if this maps to point B, we just want to go twice as far. So we're at 3 away, we want to go 6 away. So point P's x-coordinate is at 3, now we're at 9. Likewise, point C is 3 below P. Well we want to go twice as far, so we'll go 3 more. And point A is 4 above P. Well we want to go 4 more. We want to go twice as far-- one, two, three, four. And we get right over there."
Math,"Then they ask us, what are the lengths of side AB and its image? AB right over here, let's see, we might have to apply the distance formula. Let's see, it's the base right over here. The change in x between the two is 3 and the change in y is 4, so this is actually a 3, 4, 5 right triangle. 3 squared plus 4 squared is equal to 5 squared. So AB is 5 units long. Essentially just using the Pythagorean theorem to figure that out. And its image, well it's image should be twice as long."
Math,"And let's see whether that actually is the case. So this is a base right over here that's of length 6. This has a height, or this change in y, I could say. Because I'm really just trying to figure out this length, which is the hypotenuse of this right triangle. I don't have my drawing tool, so I apologize. But this height right here is 8. So 8 squared is 64, plus 6 squared is 36, that's 100, which is 10 squared. So notice, our scale factor of 2, the corresponding side got twice as long."
Math,Each of these points got twice as far away from our center of dilation..
Math,"And let's see, they give us a couple of rows here. This is the class. Then they give us the period of the day that the class happened. And then they give us the average score on an exam. And we have to be a little careful with the study-- maybe there's some correlation depending on what subject is taught during what period. But let's just use her data, at least, just based on her data, see if-- well, definitely do what they're asking us, plot a scatter plot, and then see if there is any connection."
Math,"So let's see. On the horizontal axis, we have Period. And on this investigation, this exploration she's doing, she's trying to see, well, does the period of the day somehow drive average score? So that's why Period is on the horizontal axis. And the thing that's driving is on the horizontal, the thing that's being driven is on the vertical. So let's plot each of these points. Period 1, average score 93-- right over there. Period 6, 87."
Math,"Oh, that's not the right place, and then we can move it if we want-- 87, right over there. Period 2, 70. Period 4, 62-- right over there. Period 4 and 86, that's right over there. Period 1, 73. Period 3, average score of 73 as well. Period 1, 80, average score of 80. And then Period 3, average score of 96. So there we go. And it doesn't really seem like there's any obvious trend over here. So let's make sure that we got this right. And we did.."
Math,"Which of the following plots suits the above description? So let's see, this looks like a negative linear association. As the years go by, you have a smaller percentage of smokers. This one does too. As years go by, you have the number of smokers go down and down. This one down here also looks like that, although it's not as smooth. If you were to fit a line here, it looks like you have a few outliers. Well, this is a positive correlation. So we can definitely rule out Graph 4."
Math,"Now, the other thing that they told us is that there are no outliers, suggests a negative linear association with no outliers. If you were to try to fit a line to Graph 3, you could fit a line pretty reasonably. That would go someplace like that. But it would have this outlier right over here. It looks like it's 12 or 13 years after 1967. So that would be 1980. It looks like an outlier there. But they said it didn't have any outliers. So we would rule out Graph 3."
Math,"And so we have to pick between Graph 1 and Graph 2. So the other hint they give us or piece of data they give us is that the percent drops by 0.5% each year. So here's what's happening. In 1967, it looks like we're at about 55%. And then 10 years go by. We are roughly at around 45, a little under 45%. So we dropped 10% in 10 years. That seems to be how much this is dropping, roughly 10% in 10 years. Another 10 years go by. We go from 45, a little more than 10% in 10 years."
Math,"And so that would mean that we're dropping, on average, more than one percentage point per year. That seems more than what's going on here. Now, let's look over here. Over here, we're starting, it looks like, at around 42%. And then after 10 years, it looks like we're at 37%. So it looks like we've dropped about 5% in 10 years, which is consistent with this. If you drop 5% in 10 years, that means you drop half a percent per year. So we'll go with Graph 2.."
Math,"It seems like it kind of approximates this trend, although this doesn't seem like a great trend. And if we ignored these two points right over, we could do something like maybe something like that. But we can't just ignore points like that. So I would say that there's actually no good line of best fit here. So let me check my answer. Let's try a couple more of these. Find the line of best-- well, this feels very similar."
Math,"It really feels like there's no-- I mean, I could do that, but I'm ignoring these two points. I could do something like that, then I'd be ignoring these points. So I'd also say no good best fit line exists. So let's try one more. So here it looks like there's very clearly this trend. And I could try to fit it a little bit better than it's fit right now. So it feels like something like that fits this trend line quite well. I could maybe drop this down a little bit, something like that."
Math,Let's check my answer. A good best fit line exists. Let me check my answer. We got it right..
Math,"The horizontal axis here, they say years since 1965. So at this point right over here, this is 0 years since 1965. So this really represents 1965. And we see it looks like around-- let's see, if I were to eyeball it, it looks like it's around 42% of Americans, just looking at this graph. I know that's not an exact number. Roughly 41% or 42% of Americans smoked in 1965 based on this graph. And then five years later, this would be 1970. 10 years later, that would be 1975."
Math,"And they don't sample the data, or we don't have data from every given year. This is just from some of the years that we happen to have. But what is clear, it looks like we have a negative linear relationship right over here, that it would not be difficult to fit a line. So let me try to do that. So I'm just going to eyeball it and try to fit a line to this data. So our line might look something like that. So it looks like a pretty strong negative linear relationship."
Math,"When I say it's a negative linear relationship, we see that as time increases, the percentage of smokers in the US is decreasing. So that's what makes it a negative relationship. Now, what are they asking? They want to estimate the percentage of American adults who smoked in 1945. Well, 1945 would be to the left of 0. So we could even think of it as if 1945 is 20 years before 1965. So let me see if I can draw that. So 20 years before 1965."
Math,"Let's see, this would be 5 years before 1965, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years before 1965. So I could even put that as negative 20 right over here. Negative 20 years since 1965 you could view as 20 years before 1965. So that would represent 1945 right over there. And one thing that we could do is very roughly just try to extend this negative linear relationship backwards. And they allow us to do that by saying assuming the trend shown on the data has been consistent. So the trend has been consistent."
Math,"This line represents the trend. So let's just keep going backwards, keep going backwards at the same rate, so something like that. I want to make sure that it looks like it's the same rate right over here. And you could just try to eyeball it. You could say, well, let's see, 20 years ago, 1945. If I were to extend that line backwards, it looks like there were about 52% of the population was smoking. It seems like we're about 52% right over here."
Math,"Another way to think about it would be to actually try to calculate the rate of decline. And let's say we do it over every 20 years, because that will be useful because we're going 20 years back. So if we go 20 years from this point, so this is 1965, you go 20 years in the future. So that is 10 years, and then that is 20 years. So my change in the horizontal is 20 years. What's the change in the vertical? Well, it looks like we have a decrease of a little bit more than 10%."
Math,"It looks like it's 11% or 12% decrease. So I'll just say minus 11% right there. And let's see if that's consistent. If we were to go another 20 years. So if we go another 20 years, it looks like once again we've gone down by about 10%. So that looks like roughly 10%. If we're following the line, it should actually be the same number. So let me write it this way. It's approximately down 10%. So that little squiggly line, I'm just saying approximately negative 10% every 20 years."
Math,"So if you go back 20 years, you should increase your percentage by 20%. So this should go up by-- or you should increase your percent by 10%, I should say. So if we started at 41% or 42%, once again, this was what we saw when we just eyeballed it, you should get to 51% or 52%. So my estimate of the percentage of American adults who smoked in 1945 would be 51% or 52%.."
Math,"They don't tell us how the line was fit, but this actually looks like a pretty good fit if I just eyeball it. Which of these linear equations best describes the given model? So this, you know, this point right over here, this shows that some student at least self-reported they studied a little bit more than half an hour, and they didn't actually do that well on the test, looks like they scored a 43 or a 44 on the test."
Math,"This right over here shows, or like this one over here is a student who says they studied two hours, and it looks like they scored about a 64, 65 on the test. And this over here or this over here looks like a student who studied over four hours, or they reported that, and they got, looks like a 95 or a 96 on the exam. And so then, and these are all the different students, each of these points represents a student, and then they fit a line."
Math,"And when they say which of these linear equations best describes the given model, they're really saying which of these linear equations describes or is being plotted right over here by this line that's trying to fit to the, that's trying to fit to the data. So essentially, we just want to figure out what is the equation of this line? Well, it looks like the y-intercept right over here is 20. And it looks like all of these choices here have a y-intercept of 20, so that doesn't help us much."
Math,"But let's think about what the slope is. When we increase by one, when we increase along our x-axis by one, so change in x is one, what is our change in y? Our change in y looks like, let's see, we went from 20 to 40. It looks like we went up by 20. So our change in y over change in x for this model, for this line that's trying to fit to the data, is 20 over one. So this is going to be our slope. And if we look at all of these choices, only this one has a slope of 20."
Math,"So it would be this choice right over here. Based on this equation, estimate the score for a student that spent 3.8 hours studying. So we would go to 3.8, which is right around, let's see, this would be, 3.8 would be right around here. So let's estimate that score. So if I go straight up, where do we intersect our model? Where do we intersect our line? So it looks like they would get a pretty high score. Let's see, if I were to take it to the vertical axis, it looks like they would get about a 97."
Math,"So I would write that my estimate is that they would get a 97 based on this model. And once again, this is only a model. It's not a guarantee that if someone studies 3.8 hours, they're gonna get a 97, but it could give an indication of what maybe, might be reasonable to expect, assuming that the time studying is the variable that matters."
Math,"But you also have to be careful with these models because it might imply if you kept going that if you get, if you study for nine hours, you're gonna get a 200 on the exam, even though something like that is impossible. So you always have to be careful extrapolating with models, and take it with a grain of salt. This is just a model that's trying to fit to this data. And you might be able to use it to estimate things or to maybe set some form of an expectation, but take it all with a grain of salt.."
Math,"Assuming the line is correct, what does the line slope of 15 So let's see. The horizontal axis is time studying in hours. The vertical axis is scores on the test. And each of these blue dots represent the time and the score for a given student. So this student right over here spent-- I don't know, it looks like they spend about 0.6 hours studying. And they didn't do too well on the exam. They look like they got below a 45, looks like a 43 or a 44 on the exam."
Math,"This student over here spent almost 4 and 1/2 hours studying and got, looks like, a 94, close to a 95 on the exam. And what Shira did is try to draw a line that tries to fit this data. And it seems like it does a pretty good job of at least showing the trend in the data. Now, slope of 15 means that if I'm on the line-- so let's say I'm here-- and if I increase in the horizontal direction by 1-- so there, I increase the horizontal direction by 1-- I should be increasing in the vertical direction by 15."
Math,"And you see that. If we increase by one hour here, we increase by 15% on the test. Now, what that means is that the trend it shows is that, in general, along this trend, if someone studies an extra hour, then if we're going with that trend, then, hey, it seems reasonable that they might expect to see a 15% gain on their test. Now, let's see which of these are consistent. In general, students who didn't study at all got scores of about 15 on the test. Well, let's see."
Math,"This is neither true-- these are the people who didn't study at all, and they didn't get a 15 on the test. And that's definitely not what this 15 implies. This doesn't say what the people who didn't study at all get. So this one is not true. That one is not true. Let's try this one. If one student studied for one hour more than another student, the student who studied more got exactly 15 more points on the test. Well, this is getting closer to the spirit of what the slope means."
Math,"But this word ""exactly"" is what, at least in my mind, messes this choice up. Because this isn't saying that it's a guarantee that if you study an hour extra that you'll get 15% more on the test. This is just saying that this is the general trend that this line is seeing. So it's not guaranteed. For example, we could find this student here who studied exactly two hours. And if we look at the students who studied for three hours, well, there's no one exactly at three hours."
Math,"But some of them-- so this was, let's see, the student who was at two hours. You go to three hours, there's no one exactly there. But there's going to be students who got better than what would be expected and students who might get a little bit worse. Notice, there's points above the trend line, and there's points below the trend line. So this ""exactly,"" you can't say it's guaranteed an hour more turns into 15%. Let's try this choice."
Math,"In general, studying for one extra hour was associated with a 15-point improvement in test score. That feels about right. In general, studying for 15 extra hours was associated with a 1-point improvement in test score. Well, no, that would get the slope the other way around. So that's definitely not the case. So let's check our answer. And we got it right.."
Math,"While this one right over here is chocolate on the outside and it has coconut on the inside. While this one, whoops, I didn't want to do that, while this one right over here does not have chocolate on the outside, but it does have coconut on the inside. This one right over here has neither chocolate nor coconut. What I want to think about is ways to represent this information that we are looking at. One way to do it is using a Venn diagram. So let me draw a Venn diagram."
Math,"So Venn diagram is one way to represent it. The way it's typically done, the convention, is that you would make a rectangle to represent the universe that you care about, in this case it would be all the chocolates. All the numbers inside of this should add up to the number of chocolates I have. So it should add up to 12. So that's our universe right over here. Then I'll draw circles to represent the sets that I care about. So say for this one I care about the set of the things that have chocolate."
Math,"So I'll draw that with a circle. You could draw them to scale, but I'm not going to draw them to scale. So that is my chocolate set, chocolate. That is my chocolate set. Then I want to have a coconut set. So coconut. Once again, not drawn to scale. I drew them roughly the same size, but you can see the chocolate set is bigger than the coconut set in reality. Coconut set. Now we can fill in the different sections."
Math,"So how many of these things have chocolate but no coconut? Let's see, we have one, two, three, four, five, six have chocolate but no coconut. Let me do that in a different color because I think the colors are important. So let me do it in green. So one, two, three, four, five, and six. So this section right over here is six. Once again, I'm not talking about the whole brown thing, I'm talking about just this area that I've shaded in green. Now how many have chocolate and coconut? Chocolate and coconut."
Math,"Well that's going to be one, two, three. So three of them have chocolate and coconut. Notice that's this section here that's in the overlap between. Three of them go into both sets, both categories. These three have coconut and they have chocolate. How many total have chocolate? Well six plus three, nine. How many total have coconut? Well we're going to have to figure that out in a second. So how many have coconut but no chocolate? Well there's only one with coconut and no chocolate."
Math,"So that's that one right over there, and that represents this are that I'm shading in in white. So how many total coconut are there? Well one plus three, or four, and you see that. One, two, three, four. The last thing we'd want to fill in, because notice, six plus three plus one only adds up to 10. What about the other two? Well the other two are neither chocolate nor coconut. Actually, let me color this. So that's one, two, these are neither chocolate nor coconut. I could write these two right over here."
Math,"These are neither chocolate nor coconut. So that's one way to represent the information of how many chocolates, how many coconuts, and how many chocolate and coconuts, and how many neither. But there's other ways that we could do it. Another way to do it would be with a two way table. Two way table. On one axis, say the vertical axis, we could say, let me write this, so has chocolate, I'll write choc for short, and then I'll write no chocolate, choc for short. Then over here I could write coconut."
Math,"I want to do that in white. I got new tools and sometimes the color changing isn't so easy. So this is coconut and then over here I'll write no coconut. Then let me make a little table. Make it clear what I'm doing here. So a line there and a line there and why not add a line over here as well. Then I can just fill in the different things. This cell, this square, this is going to represent the number that has coconut and chocolate."
Math,"Well we are already looked into that, that's one, two, three, that's these three right over here. So that's those three right over there. This one right over here, it has chocolate, but it doesn't have coconut. Well that's this six right over here. It has chocolate, but it doesn't have coconut. So let me write this is that six right over there. Then this box would be it has coconut, but no chocolate. Well how many is that? Well coconut no chocolate that's that one there."
Math,"Then this one is going to be no coconut and no chocolate. We know what that's going to be. No coconut and no chocolate is going to be two. If we wanted to, we could even throw in totals over here. We could write, actually let me just do that just for fun. I could write total, I could write total, and if I total it vertically, so three plus one this is four, six plus two is eight. So this four is the total number that have coconut that has chocolate and doesn't have chocolate. That's three plus one."
Math,"This eight is the total that does not have coconut. No coconut. So the total of no coconut, and that of course is going to be the six plus this two. We could total horizontally. Three plus six is nine. One plus two is three. What's this nine? That's the total amount of chocolate, six plus three. What's this three? This is the total amount no chocolate. That's this one plus two. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting. This is just different ways of representing the same information.."
Math,"Complete the following two-way table of column relative frequencies. So that's what they're talking here, this is a two-way table of column relative frequencies. If necessary, round your answers to the nearest hundredth. So, let's see what they're saying. They're saying, let's see... Of the accidents within the last year, 28 were the people were driving an SUV, a Sport Utility Vehicle and 35 were in a Sports car. Of the No accidents in the last year, 97 were in SUV and a 104 were in sports cars."
Math,"Another way you could think of it, of the Sport utility vehicles that were driven and the total, let's see it's 28 plus 97 which is going to be 125. Of that 125, 28 had an accident within the last year and 97 did not have an accident within the last year. Similarly, you could say of the 139 Sports cars 35 had an accident in the last year, 104 did not have an accident in the last year. So what they want us to do is put those relative frequencies in here. So the way we could think about it."
Math,"One right over here, this represents all the Sport utility vehicles. So one way you could think about, that represents the whole universe of the Sport Utility Vehicles, at least the universe that this table shows. So, that's really representative of the 28 plus the 97. And so, in each of these we want to put the relative frequencies. So this right over here is going to be 28 divided by the total. So over here is 28, but we want this number to be a fraction of the total."
Math,"Well the fraction of the total is gonna be, 28 over 97 plus 28. Which of course is going to be 125. Actually let me just write them all like that first. This one right over here is going to be 97 over 125. And of course, when you add this one and this one, it should add up to one. Likewise, this one's going to be 35 over 139. 35 plus 104. So, 139. And this is going to be 104 over 104 plus 35. Which is 139. So, let me just calculate each of them using this calculator. Let me scroll down a little bit."
Math,"And so, if I do 28 divided by 125, I get 0.224. They said round your answers to the nearest hundredth. So this is 0.22. No accident within the last year, 97 divided by 125. So 97 divided by 125 is equal to, see here if I rounded to the nearest hundredth I'm gonna round up. 0.78, so this is 0.78. Then, 35 divided by 139. 35 divided by 139, is equal to, round to the nearest hundredth, 0.25. And then 104 divided by 139. 104 divided by 139, gets me if I round to the nearest hundredth, 0.75."
Math,"0.75, then I can check my answer. And I got it right. But the key thing here is to make sure we understand what's going on here. So, we could- One way to think about this is 22% of the Sport utility vehicles had an accident within the last year. Or you could say .22 of them. And you could say 78% or 0.78 of the Sport utility vehicles had no accidents. Likewise, you could say 25% of the Sports cars had an accident within the last year. And 75% did not have an accident last year."
Math,"So, it allows you think more in terms of the relative frequencies, the whole, the percentages, however you want to think about it. While this gives you the actual numbers.."
Math,"So for example this column right over here is Men. The column total is 1.00, or you could say 100 percent. And we can see that 0.42 of the Men or 42 percent of the Men voted for Obama. We can see 52% of the Men or 0.52 of the Men voted for Romney. And we can see that the Other, neither Obama, 6 percent went for neither Obama nor Romney. And for Women, 52 percent went for Obama, 43 percent went for Romney and 5 percent went for Other."
Math,"And then these, this 52 plus 43 plus 5 will add up to 100 percent of the women. During the 2012 United States presidential election, were male voters more likely to vote for Romney than female voters? So let's see. If we, there are a couple of ways you could think about it. Well, actually, let's go this way. Male voters, if you were a man, 52 percent of them voted for Romney. While for the Women, 43 percent of them voted for Romney. So a man was more likely."
Math,"If you randomly picked a man who voted, there was a 52 percent chance they voted for Romney, while if you randomly picked a woman, there was a 43 percent, of women who voted, there was a 43 percent chance that she voted for Romney. So yes, male voters were more likely to vote for Romney than female voters. So the answer is Yes. And we're done.."
