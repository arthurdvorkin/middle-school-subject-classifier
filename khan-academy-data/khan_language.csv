subject,text
Language,"Understanding the plot of a story is essential to writing about it. You can't write about a story if you can't express what happened in it. So what I want to do today is talk about creating objective summaries of texts. Summaries that are free of opinion, or non biased. If you're summarizing a book, you wanna get across the events of the story. Objectivity is hard and weird and has a very specific purpose. You use it to build the bones of your analysis."
Language,"Once you've got the structure in place, bring opinions back. Here are the facts and now here's what I think about those facts. Let me be clear, opinions are good. Opinions are where analysis lives. The whole field of literary criticism would be awfully boring if nobody ever held opinions but all that criticism rests on a basis of objectively summarized texts. So let's talk about how to do just that, how to objectively summarize a text. Here's what you need to do."
Language,"Step one, read the thing you want to summarize. You can't do one without the other. Step two, ask yourself, what are the important parts of this story? Not the interesting parts, not the cool parts, but the most essential parts of the story. Remember we're trying to be objective here so it's not about including the parts you especially liked. So who are the main characters, where does the story take place, what happens in the plot? Step three, pare it down."
Language,"Look at all those important parts you listed, and cut out everything that isn't absolutely essential. Major characters only, setting, conflict, climax, resolution. Step four, put it in order. Write it all out as sentences in the order the plot happened in. The idea is to be able to summarize a whole story in a handful of sentences, like a single five sentence paragraph. And you're gonna wanna paraphrase here."
Language,"Whatever you need to say, say it in your own words so you can get it across as quickly as possible. Ordinarily, I'd say quoting from the text is an important skill but this is one time you won't use it. All right so, those are the four steps. To demonstrate, I'm gonna take a fiction piece from a Khan Academy exercise and I'll go through that process with you. Step one, let's read it all, read this little story chunk. ""'Wilky!' Captain Martello bellowed below deck."
Language,"""'We need your help!' I climbed the ladder quickly ""and was astonished that I hadn't awakened on my own. ""Usually I could sense a storm brewing ""hours before it arrived. ""Captain Martello noticed my look of surprise. ""'She's coming on quick, this one. Here, grab the rope, ""Help me pull down the sail.' ""Overboard, the waters had changed. ""No longer were they an inviting green hue, ""they were dark, foreboding."
Language,"""The moon above tried to peek through the angry sky ""but the clouds kept hijacking her hopeful glow. ""Suddenly, a giant slow rolling wave ""forced my side of the vessel to dip into the water. ""I tried to hang on but the lurching wave was tugging at me. ""Captain Martello grabbed my leg ""and managed to yank me onto Adelina's salt sprayed deck. ""'You're safe,' he said firmly, 'for now.'"" Okay step two, what are the important parts of the story? Okay so Wilky comes on deck when Captain Martello asks him to."
Language,"They're on a boat. And note here that I'm just sort of scribbling down notes, these aren't even sentences. There's a storm coming that Wilky didn't predict. The captain tells Wilky to help him strike the sail. The water is a scary color, a wave nearly washes Wilky overboard but the captain saves him. Oh and the ship is called the Adelina. I think that's a neat name for a ship. All right step three, pare it down. So the fact that I think that Adelina is a neat name for a ship is opinion and not relevant."
Language,"It's also not super relevant that Wilky didn't predict the storm. Or that the water is a spooky color. So do we have all the important details in here? The name of the ship, check. The name of Wilky and Captain Martello, the fact that there is a storm. So part of this is relevant but not the prediction part and Wilky nearly being tossed overboard but saved by the captain. So step four, let's take all of that, put it in order. Start afresh, full sentences, okay."
Language,"Captain Martello calls Wilky up to the deck of the Adelina to help him prepare the ship for a sudden storm. Wilky is nearly washed overboard by a big wave but Martello saves them. That's our strategy, you see? Boil down the story to its essentials, strip away unnecessary detail and rephrase events in your own words in the order that they happened in. Once you've got that squared away, you're ready to back up that great big dump truck full of opinions. All right bring her in."
Language,"(truck backing up beeping) Let them have it, fellows. (crashing) You love to see it. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Understanding what characters do is key to your success as a reader. The way characters behave towards themselves, towards others, towards objects, can tell us a lot about them and can give us clues to the larger messages in a story. Character actions are what drive a story forward. Let my co-worker Kim read you a story in which nobody takes any actions. -    Once upon a time, there was a magical kingdom in which nobody ever did anything."
Language,"Nobody baked bread or called their friends on the phone or played video games or soccer or basketball or wrote books or ate yogurt. They didn't even nap. They just sat there. (Kim yawns) It was a very boring kingdom. -    Why, thank you, Kim. Without character action, there is no story. Let's try that again. I'll blow the horn of action and Kim you do that again, but this time let's throw in some character decisions. All right, lights, camera, horn of action."
Language,"(horn blares) -    The magical kingdom of Belchantry was abuzz with activity. Bakers baked, ballers shot hoops, yogurt smiths made yogurt. The young princess Lulabell practiced her swordplay. And on a great tower on the outskirts of town an evil wizard put the finishing touches on a spell that would bring terrible darkness to the land. -    See, now that's a story I wanna hear. Character actions and decisions have to drive the story."
Language,"It's about what characters choose to do, not just about the world around them. There could be a big, scary storm, but that's not character action. It's about how the characters react to the storm that matters, that shapes the story. What do characters do in times of trouble or when their friends need help? That's when you can learn the most about them. Actions speak louder than words, after all."
Language,"What motivates these characters? Why do they act the way they act? What are the values or beliefs that drive them? What are their goals? And what does that tell us about the message of the story? Sometimes characters don't behave in the way that we expect, like villainous characters may seem nice in order to do evil things. If we think about ""The Three Little Pigs."" If the Big Bad Wolf is going door to door and saying, ""Hello, little pig. ""It's me, your new neighbor, the Small Nice Wolf."
Language,"""And I brought you some cookies."" If you're the pig looking out the window, you should open the door, right? Heek no! The wolf is trying to trick you, lock the door. What's interesting about looking at character actions is they can help us see how characters change throughout a story. In the film ""Moana,"" the demi-god character Maui begins as a selfish tricky character, but by the end of the movie he's changed and he cares about Moana and helps her. We can see that because of his actions."
Language,"He begins by stealing Moana's boat and stranding her on an island, and he ends by sacrificing his magic fish hook to help her. Sorry for ""Moana"" spoilers. Characters in stories can be complex, just like real people. The way they behave might surprise you. And if it does, ask yourself, why is this a surprise? Why is this character behaving in this way? Look for evidence throughout a text to help you understand the way characters act."
Language,"If you've insight into their thoughts or feelings, that can be a great place to start. But, for now, I'm going to take action by ending this video. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,You could be missing out on a wealth of information and added detail. Good readers use pictures to help them understand stories even better. And let's talk about why that is. Pictures can help describe the mood of a story or how a story makes you feel.
Language,"If I'm telling a story about a girl and her dad going for a walk in the woods, but then when you see an image of those woods and the trees are all spindly and black and the sky is a leaden gray, what does that tell you about the mood of the story? It's grim, it's creepy, it's a scary walk in some scary woods. The way the story feels can be expressed through the illustrations. Pictures can help describe the events of a story."
Language,"Maybe the story's a little unspecific, say, for instance, we're talking about Little Red Riding Hood, and it says, ""The big bad wolf swallows Granny up ""and disguises himself as her."" But it doesn't go into further detail. Well, what does that mean? What does his disguise look like? And we can look at an illustration like this and say: Okay, that big bulge in the wolf's stomach is where Granny is, and the wolf's got on Granny's bonnet and little glasses and all. So that's his disguise."
Language,"It is not very convincing to me, but what do I know? And pictures can help fill in important details. I can look at a character's expression as I'm reading to help me answer questions I might have about how that character feels. What's going on there with the face of the wolf? Is that a smile, is that a grimace? The text can give me a clue, but then the picture can tell me the rest of the story. We can use our knowledge of how real life people are or behave to help understand pictures in a story."
Language,"The wolf, for example, the face he's making with his eyes narrowed and his brows knit like that and that smile creeping across his features, to me, that's a scheming face. That's the face someone makes when they're talking to themselves and planning something nasty. He's also putting on Granny's bonnet and glasses. We know these aren't things wolves are known to wear. And he seems very pleased with himself. So he's eaten Granny, he's putting on her clothes."
Language,"He seems really happy about it, but in an evil way, and we can use that to inform the way we read the story. This wolf isn't satisfied with eating an old woman. He wants to eat her grandkid for dessert. So greedy, what a greedy, mean little beast! The point is that pictures in stories are really useful. Read them the same way you read words. Understanding images will make you a stronger reader, and if you can learn that, why then, you can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Hey, what's up readers? David here. I'm taking advantage of the cold that I have by doing my serious detective voice in order to teach you about inferences. (phone ringing) Hold on, let me get that. Hi, this is David. I'm in the middle of doing a video. Now isn't a great time. - [Man On Phone] Hello, I have information about what an inference is. -    Oh, oh that's great. Cool, follow me over to the next screen."
Language,"What is an inference, please? - [Man On Phone] An inference is a conclusion that you make based on clues given in a piece of writing. It's more than a guess, but it's not just an observation either. -    Great, thank you. Was that all you needed? - [Man On Phone] Yeah, that was my only thing. -    All right, thanks, bye. - [Man On Phone] Goodbye. -    So an inference is a conclusion that you draw from writing."
Language,"It's an idea that you pull from a sentence or a passage that isn't literally printed there. It's the detective work of reading, finding clues that help you make sense of what's being said. I feel like we're kind of getting bogged down in theory land so let's take a look at an example. I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. There's my snow fort. It's a D on the flag to represent me. There's me little hot cocoa, couple marshmallows floating in there, my Khan Academy mug."
Language,"They don't make Khan Academy mugs. I want a Khan Academy mug. Okay, so what conclusions can we draw from these two sentences? I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. Beautiful, brilliant, enormous. Then I came inside and had a big mug of hot chocolate. Same deal, brilliant, beautiful, enormous. What conclusions can I draw about this situation? Well if you're making things out of snow and then you're coming inside and having hot chocolate, it's probably not the height of summer."
Language,"One inference that I can draw from these two sentences together is that it is winter time when this sentence takes place. Where I live, these are not activities that one pursues in the height of summer outside. I'm looking for clues within the text. Snow fort, I'm outside, I came inside and then I had hot chocolate which is not traditionally a beverage that is consumed when it's warm out. Let's take a look at another example."
Language,"This paragraph is part of a longer passage that is about a young ballet dancer named Michaela. Michaela danced so wonderfully that she was awarded a scholarship to attend the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School at the American Ballet Theater. That was only the beginning of her dancing success. When she was 17, Michaela danced with the Dance Theater of Harlem professional company. Later, she joined the Dutch National Junior Company. Today, Michaela is a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet."
Language,"So very quickly without getting bogged down in this passage, what are some conclusions, what are some inferences that we can draw about Michaela? Who is Michaela? What do we know about her? We know that she's a dancer. We know that she's very good at it, right? She danced so wonderfully that she got a scholarship. So I'm gonna say Michaela is very talented and we know that her talent led to success because her getting the scholarship was only the beginning of her dancing success."
Language,"We can see from the passage that she was part of at least three different dance companies, the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Dutch National Junior Company, and as a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet today. So I'm gonna say that Michaela is a very hard worker. Now notice no where in the passage does it say Michaela is a very talented, hard working dancer. Just like in the previous example, it didn't say, it was winter outside so I made a snow fort."
Language,"What the skill of inference is requires you to be a detective and take your magnifying glass to the passage to discover clues. Imagine you're a detective like this dog. He's wearing a little deer stalker cap. Let's call him, let's call him Sherlock Bones, the famous dog detective that I just made up. I feel like Sherlock Holmes is always smoking a pipe so I'm gonna give this dog like a, I don't know a bone or a piece of rawhide or something."
Language,"Imagine that you are a detective or a dog detective if you like and every time you read a text, let's say a book, that you are searching for clues within it. What you're doing when you make an inference is you are taking the information that you already know about the world and the places and people in it and how they behave and what they look like and what they do and you're applying that knowledge to the text."
Language,"When do people build snowmen? When do people build snow forts? When do they drink hot cocoa? In the winter time. An important thing to remember though is that inferring is not guessing. Any time you make an inference, you have to be pulling it directly from the text. That's your jumping off point. It can't just be a wild guess out of no where. It comes from information that you've got there on the page. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go eat my weight in cough drops."
Language,"You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Wait, what? Oh, hello squirrel. - [Squirrel] You heard me, big legs. What's the big idea? Were you tromping all over my patch of forest without so much as a how do you do? -    I'm sorry. How do you do? - Hello. -    How can I make it up to you? - [Squirrel] Well, okay. I'm working on a school assignment. -    Squirrels have school? - Yeah. - All right, all right. Sorry, go on. - [Squirrel] So I've got this newspaper article, and Mr. Badgerton says I have to draw out what the main idea is."
Language,"How is that different from a summary? -    Okay, a summary is all of the key details of an article or a story, but a main idea is bigger than details. It's what those details add up to. A main idea is the key information that the author wants you to know after you've finished reading the text."
Language,"So, for example, what's going on in your article? - [Squirrel] It's about the creek in the forest, and how everyone wants to drink from it, but the otters wanna swim in it, the bears wanna fish in it, and the beavers wanna build a dam in it and turn the whole thing into a pond. -    Not as peaceful of a forest as I thought, huh? - [Squirrel] Not so much, no. -    What you just told me is a summary of the events of the news story."
Language,"But the big idea there is that there's a conflict or fight over who has access to the creek. - [Squirrel] So you just zipped all the supporting details out of my summary, and made it more about the ideas? -    Yeah, exactly. The main idea is that different animals wanna use the creek. - [Squirrel] Can you give me a more complicated example? -    I would love to. Why don't we take a look at this text about brain growth? So here's a passage about training your brain."
Language,"I'm going to read it, I'm gonna make notes, and then I'm gonna summarize each paragraph. And then, I'll take all those summaries, put 'em together, and that'll help us come up with a main idea. So, here we go. Your brain gets stronger when you exercise it, just like muscles get stronger when you exercise them. Training your brain isn't always easy or comfortable. In fact, your brain uses up 20% of the oxygen and blood in your body because it works so hard."
Language,"Okay, so, your brain can get stronger, but it's not easy. Here are some examples of how your brain grows when you learn new things. Learning math strengthens the parts of the brain that are linked to memory, thought, and action. Imagine that! Remember when you first learned how to add and subtract? You got faster and faster with more practice. That's because your neurons, those are brain cells, your neurons were learning how to work with each other, and then your memory improved."
Language,"But memory is useful for more than just math. I'm gonna underline more than just math. That same part of your brain helps you remember basketball plays, dance routines, and even nice memories with your friends and family. So it's not just about math. Learning and practicing things helps your brain work faster. Learning or practicing anything, yes anything! Learning and practicing helps strengthen and change our brains."
Language,"Your brain is changing and creating new neural pathways, which is just another way of saying brain connections, right? Neural is similar to neuron. So it's like, having to do with brain cells. Your brain is changing and creating new neural pathways when you struggle to learn something new. So struggle is important. In other words, there's a lot happening in your brain when you're learning."
Language,"All learning can build new information pathways, but learning things that are challenging for you can supercharge your brain growth. In other words, the more you're challenged, the faster you learn. So here are my paragraph summaries. Your brain can get stronger, but it's not easy. Learning and practicing helps your brain work faster. And the more you're challenged, the faster you learn."
Language,"Putting those three things together, I would say that the main idea of this passage is that learning new information can strengthen your brain. Let's get our little thinky pinky back in there. What I did was I took something from each paragraph and found what they all had in common. There were some details, for example, about math or dance practice, that are important, but aren't so important that they need to be included in the main idea."
Language,"All of that can just sort of be pushed into this broader idea of learning new information makes your brain stronger, can strengthen your brain. - [Squirrel] So how should I be thinking about main ideas? -    All right. So, are you familiar with the expression, ""You can't see the forest for the trees""? - [Squirrel] David, I live in a forest. Of course I'm familiar. -    So it means, right, don't get so hung up on details that you can't see the big picture."
Language,"The trees, one by one, are all part of the forest. They make up the forest. Right, you with me? - Yes. -    A summary of the forest is all the important details. There's a stream here, there's a birch tree here, a Douglas fir tree here, a red oak tree here, a rock there. But the main idea is this is a forest. All of those things together add up to the idea of a forest. - [Squirrel] But do they add up to you doing my homework assignment? -    They do not. - [Squirrel] Aw, nuts."
Language,"-    You can learn anything. David, out.."
Language,"And as readers, we use those examples to grab hold of those ideas and better understand them. If I tell you that I have weird hobbies, I need to back up that statement with some examples. I need to illustrate just how weird they are. So if I say my hobbies include going for walks, reading books, and drinking tea, those are very ordinary interests, they're not weird at all. Not a good example. I need to be more selective and better support my claim that my hobbies are strange."
Language,"So instead, I could say my hobbies include puppeteering, making bubble tea from scratch, and learning to read Middle English. Well, now we're getting somewhere, right? Now you're starting to understand just how much of a weirdo this David guy is."
Language,"What is the function of an example? What does it do? When you come across an example, ask yourself, what purpose does this example serve? Why did the author introduce this detail here? How does this example connect to the text overall? Does it form a pattern with other details? And if so, what does that pattern tell me? And finally we ask ourselves, does this example raise other questions? Let's look at a text and evaluate its examples. Here's an excerpt from a piece about the author J.M."
Language,"Barrie, the creator of ""Peter Pan"". ""Barrie didn't have just one version ""of the ""Peter Pan"" story, ""he made changes along the way. ""For example, he learned ""that children were copying Peter Pan ""and trying to jump out of their beds to fly. ""Some of them were getting badly injured! ""So Barrie added the rule that in order to fly, ""you had to have fairy or pixie dust ""blown on you first. ""By adding this rule, ""J.M."
Language,"Barrie was trying to help children understand ""that flying is magical, ""so that they wouldn't try to do it themselves and get hurt."" So the author is saying that J.M. Barrie changed ""Peter Pan"" and then he gives an example of the change. Let's zero in on that example and ask those questions that we just went over. So for this example, what is its purpose? Well, it does a couple of things. It shows us that J.M. Barrie was willing to make changes to his story after it was initially published."
Language,"It shows us that the author wants to portray Barrie as a responsible person. He heard about children injuring themselves by copying his story and so he made an effort to prevent that by changing a detail in the story. It's also a pretty specific example that I can picture. I can imagine kids jumping off of tall things and getting hurt, and Barrie feeling worried about that. And because I can picture it, I can better understand it, which helps me better understand the overall text."
Language,"I only excerpted a small portion of this text. So I'm not gonna ask how it connects to the text overall. But this example does raise other questions for me, like what other children's fiction accidentally encourages people to do dangerous stunts at home? Like jumping off your bed? Examples are really powerful! They can shape a reader's impression of a topic. As a writer, employ them tactically to help develop someone's understanding."
Language,"Recognize that when a series of examples comes in sequence, it tells a story, and story is an incredibly powerful tool. Use it responsibly. As a reader, understand the power that examples have and pay attention to how they're being used. A well-chosen example or two can create a false narrative. As readers, we are engaged in a push and pull with writers, especially when they are trying to convince us of something. Make a writer work to convince you. Read with a skeptical attitude."
Language,"And if you can do that, you can learn anything. David, out.."
Language,"And sometimes that purpose will be harder to see. As readers, our job is to consider the author's purpose as we read. How is it influencing the information the author shares? How is it influencing my understanding of the topic? Is what I think the same as what the author thinks? Do I agree with them? Do I disagree? You may be familiar with the memory device of P.I.E., persuade, inform, entertain, as three categories of purpose. But I'd like to go deeper than that."
Language,"I live in Washington, D.C., which is home to an entire professional class of what are called lobbyists, people whose job it is to advocate to Congress on behalf of a special interest, for example, the oil industry or the cheese industry. This isn't always bad. You can learn more about lobbyists and advocates in Khan Academy's Government and Politics course. But frequently, it takes the form of someone from an industry trying to convince Congress to give them a competitive advantage over other industries."
Language,"Now, let's pull real-world politics out of this and pretend for the purposes of this lesson that there are two warring lobbying groups in D.C. One that represents the cake industry, and another that represents the pie industry. An age-old conflict. So hold that conflict in your mind for a second, cake versus pie. Now, when we read informational text, we should be learning new information. But the author's opinions can shape the text to the point where the information becomes biased or misleading."
Language,"When you read informational text, maintain an air of healthy skepticism. Ask yourself the following questions constantly. What's the author's opinion? What information did they include, or what information did they leave out? And if so, was that on purpose? What's the connotation of the author's word choice? You know, how do the words feel? And what's the overall tone of the piece? So now we have these questions to ask ourselves, let's return to our pie versus cake lobby fight in Washington."
Language,"So imagine you're reading ""The Washington Post,"" and you see this opinion column. ""Cake Connected to Cavities ""and Poor Dental Health, Study Finds."" ""A recent study by the American Dental Association ""connected the consumption of cake or similar foods ""with a 30% increased risk of tooth decay, ""cavities, and gingivitis. ""People who reported having consumed cake ""in the previous 60 days were significantly more likely ""to experience problems related to dental health ""than those people who did not."
Language,"""Cake is dangerous. ""Cake, which rarely contains fruit, will rot your teeth."" And then if we squint down at the very bottom of the column, it'll say in small text, ""The author is the CEO ""of Circular Solutions, a pie-advocacy network."" And now let's ask ourselves those same questions again while acknowledging that this is a fake story that I made up for the purposes of this video. There is nobody named Wendell Apricotjam, although I wish there were, that'd be a great name."
Language,"So, what's the author's opinion? Well, it seems to me that the author really thinks cake is dangerous and poses a threat to the nation's dental health. We know this because they literally say ""cake is dangerous."" They want people to buy and eat fewer cakes. What information did the author choose to include? Well, so this is interesting."
Language,"The author talks about the results of this study and the big takeaways about the danger of cake or similar foods, and then they go on to mention incidentally that cake rarely contains fruit. That's a curious thing to say. It's almost like they're saying, ""Pie, which has fruit in it, is better for you than cake,"" without actually saying it."
Language,"What information did the author choose to leave out? Well, notice that the piece says ""cake or similar foods."" I would be hard-pressed to come up with a definition of foods similar to cake that does not also include desserts like pie. But the way that this piece is written, it swerves out of its way to avoid pinning the same tooth decay risks on pie the way that it blames cake."
Language,"I think it would be reasonable to assume that if we read the underlying study that this opinion piece is based on, it would include pies and cakes in the same category of sugary desserts that are associated with bad dental outcomes. Why would the author do this? Well, they want you to buy pie instead of cake. But they don't want you to think too hard about it because if you did, you would buy and eat both less cake and less pie. And the pie lobby doesn't want that."
Language,"What's the connotation or the feeling of the author's word choices? Well, they're citing a scientific study by dentists, so they want you to take their warning seriously, and they're using words like risk and danger, rot and problems. They want you to make an association between eating cake and bad tooth health. They want you to associate scientific language with trustworthiness. So I'm gonna put down scientific authority here. What's the overall tone? It's negative."
Language,"The author does not want you to eat cake. They want you to think it's bad, and they've planted a little hint here that fruity foods are better. And what's a fruity food? Can they say pie is safer? No, not without lying outright. Now, I wanna be clear about two things. Sometimes an author's purpose really will just be to inform straightforwardly. Not everything has to be a tug-of-war between you and the author over the truth."
Language,"Sometimes a writer just wants you to know the lifecycle of a butterfly, or how to make egg salad, or the order the U.S. presidents came in. But most of the time, there's a purpose, an opinion, behind the text. Now, the second thing I wanna be super clear about is that I made up this whole thing. I made up the article, the statistics, Wendell, you know, all of that's fake. I like both pie and cake very much."
Language,"And now that I've said that, I'm sure you're wondering, ""Oh, is David in the pocket of big dessert?"" And the answer is no. I'm in the pocket of big free education for everyone everywhere. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Definitely, consult your parent or guardian. But in the film, you witness four distinct accounts from four separate people. And each person remembers what happened very differently. The stories contradict each other. And by the end of the film, it's still not completely clear who did what to whom. Now, this raises an interesting philosophical question."
Language,"What is the truth? How does a person's perspective their point of view, their background, and their beliefs change the way they interpret events or ideas? As readers, it's our job to engage with that question by reading and synthesizing multiple accounts of events. When we read multiple accounts, we grow closer to understanding a fuller picture of what happened. Now, we've talked before about the distinction between firsthand and secondhand accounts. So in 1912, the Titanic sank."
Language,"Someone was aboard and survived to tell their story has a firsthand account. A historian who writes an account of the Titanic has a secondhand account and can incorporate multiple perspectives. But even among the firsthand accounts, you can have wildly different stories. Compare someone who was working in the ship's boiler room to a rich passenger in a fancy suite. They would've had very different experiences of surviving or, ugh, not surviving, a shipwreck."
Language,"And it's important to get in a range of perspectives in order to get that full picture. If you ever watched any kind of sports game, you've probably seen an argument like this. That's a baseball player arguing with an umpire. Umpires and referees have one perspective on a sports game, ""You were out!"" And the players have another, ""I was safe!"" They both saw the same event, the same play, but they see it differently because their perspectives are so different."
Language,"Now, we can take this understanding to the texts that we read. Who's the author of a text? What's their perspective? And what informs that perspective? The baseball player wants to be declared safe, the umpire wants to adhere to the rules as strictly as possible, but maybe there also an umpire that likes to call players out because they like having that power over people. Let's go back to the example of the crime scene from the beginning of the video. Imagine there's been a car crash."
Language,"Now, below are two different accounts of the same crash. From the driver's perspective, ""I was driving along, hands on the wheel, ""eyes on the road, when suddenly, ""out of nowhere, this kid on a bike ""comes racing out in front of me! ""I swerve to avoid them ""and ran my car into this tree. ""It's the biker's fault my car is wrecked!"" Now, here's the cyclist's perspective. ""I was biking along, in the bike lane, ""when I look over and this driver is texting, ""not looking where they're going."
Language,"""They were weaving into the bike lane, ""so I moved out into the road ""to keep from being hit. ""They must have panicked because they crashed ""their car right into a tree. ""I'm lucky the driver didn't hit me! ""They should pay attention when they drive"" Same situation, very different perspectives. Now, if we only had an additional eye witness to tell us what they saw. That might clear things up. The more accounts you have, the more confident you can feel in the accuracy of the facts."
Language,"So ask yourself who's writing the text. Are they a fancy passenger on a cruise ship or are they shoveling coal in the boiler room? Are they a baseball player or a baseball umpire? It is only by comparing multiple accounts that we'll get to the bottom of things. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"using details from a text to make inferences, aren't you? - [Sherlock Bones] Yes, my boy! It's simplicity itself. But first, let me deduce a few things about you, shall I? -    Well, Mr. Bones, we're trying to do this about writing, not about people, so... - [Bones] Give me your hand. -    Waugh! - [Bones] Ah, you like to cook, you have a nervous disposition and you work for Khan Academy."
Language,"-    Now how did you know that? - [Bones] You have a callus on your finger from how you hold a knife, your fingernails are bitten, not clipped and your messenger bag says Khan Academy. -    Well and I told you who I was before I showed up. - [Bones] That too. -    But what does this have to do with reading a book? - [Bones] I correctly deduced several truths about your person based on clues, my good David. Indeed, all inference is making sense of clues."
Language,"When you read a story, you are constantly making inferences. -    I see. Okay, I'll read a passage and then see what I can make of it. An hour later, thick smoke poured up the stairs. The smoke detector screamed and I could hear Uncle Paleo stumbling around with the fire extinguisher. When he came upstairs afterward, his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. He was a wreck, broken glasses, black smudges on his face and singed hair."
Language,"Okay, so I can surmise that there was some kind of fire or explosion downstairs, where the character Uncle Paleo was. - [Bones] Hm, how do you know? -    Well his hair was singed, that's another word for burned and his face was covered in black smudges like you get from soot from a fire and there was all the smoke and the smoke detector went off. - [Bones] And there is also the matter of the fire extinguisher. -    Also that. - [Bones] I see something else in that passage too."
Language,"-    What's that, Mr. Bones? - [Bones] Uncle Paleo was exhausted by putting out the fire. -    How can you tell? Where does it say that? - [Bones] Well, it doesn't. That's inference, my lad. Note here how it said his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. Why might that be? -    He stepped in something sticky. No, oo, he's wearing shoes made of lead. - [Bones] Well, those are indeed possible explanations but you want to think of the most likely option."
Language,"-    He was running around to put the fire out and it made him tired. - [Bones] So, you were reading between the lines, were you? Drawing conclusions from the text? -    I was. So we know for sure Uncle Paleo was tired, right? - [Bones] WE DO NOT, SIR. -    Oh!! - [Bones] An inference is only one possible conclusion but is not the only conclusion. -    So what are we to do? - [Bones] The more clues you discover, the stronger your inferences will become."
Language,"You have to look at what you already know about a character, about the setting of the story, the events of a story's plot and piece it together from there. You know that fires create lots of black dust or soot so it strengthens your argument in favor of a fire. And it's background knowledge like that, about the way the world works that will serve you as a reader and as a maker of inferences. Apply what you know to the world of the story and make inferences based on that."
Language,"-    And then, I can become the world's greatest consulting detective? - [Bones] You can become like the world's 50th greatest consulting detective, top of the heap's rather full, I'm afraid. -    Well, thank you for your time today, Mr. Bones. Best of luck with your case work. - [Bones] Thank you; I shan't need it. (barks) -    You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"At the time of this recording, I'm 31 and I run into new and confusing words every day. I read a lot and it's always a fun challenge to run into words like, I don't know, glabrous or limned or nacreous. I know a lot about language and even I have trouble figuring out what those words mean on their own. So it's important to rely on context, the language that surrounds the word. Let's say you're reading a text and you come across a sentence that has a word in it you don't recognize."
Language,"Here's a bit from a passage about the famous chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. ""Jane Goodall arrived at Tanzania's ""Gombee Stream National Park in 1960. ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers. ""After all, she had not yet been to college."" So let's pause on unconventional. What does that word mean? Well, let me give you some ideas, that's the memory aid I use to keep it straight."
Language,"IDEAS, it stands for inference, definition, example, antonym, synonym, I-D-E-A-S, IDEAS, which are all different kinds of context clues. Every word will have a different context, so you might need to vary your approach. The way this snippet is written let's try inference first, then I'll rewrite the sentence a few times to show you the other methods. Okay, the I in IDEAS, inference. We can draw conclusions from the context."
Language,"If we don't know what unconventional means, we can take a look at the rest of the sentence or other nearby sentences to figure it out. Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal."
Language,"And because I'm making an inference about this word's meaning I wanna keep an eye out for it in other places to see if I can confirm or revise that working definition later. D - definition. Context clues like these will just give you the definition of the word in question. So a good example of that would be: ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers."
Language,"""She hadn't been to college yet, ""and this made her different and unexpected."" Different and unexpected is a great definition for the word unconventional. This style of context clue occurs when the author expects a word to be unfamiliar to you and builds in a guide for you right there in the text. The E in IDEAS stands for example, and this is somewhere between inference and definition. If the author describes Goodall as unconventional, they'll go on to talk about something unconventional that Goodall did."
Language,"""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among animal researchers. ""For one thing, she hadn't been to college yet."" So this is very similar to that initial sentence, except for the transition phrase for one thing, which is a way to set up examples. Antonym - an antonym is a word whose meaning is the opposite of another word, like how night is the opposite of day, or how love is the opposite of hate."
Language,"So if there's an example in the text of what Jane Goodall was not, we can use that to figure out what she was. So let's say the passage said: ""Goodall was unconventional. ""She didn't conform, and she wasn't ordinary."" There we have two antonyms and our answer. Similarly, synonym just means write another word with the same meaning similar to a definition. ""Jane Goodall was unconventional. ""She was a nonconformist."
Language,"""She went against the grain."" You can see that I had to rewrite the sentences each time to apply to each context clue strategy, which shows me that you won't find all five context clues every time you need to search for a word's meaning. You need to find the approach that makes the most sense in context. See what I did there, ah huh? And failing that, you can always look up an unfamiliar word in a dictionary. I love to do that."
Language,"I think that's great, but I also feel a sense of victory when I correctly figure out what a new word means, when I've put it together from context. And maybe if I'm still curious, I look it up later and then I turn out to be right, and I'm all like ""Victory at sea, I did it!"" Oh, and if you were curious, glabrous means smooth and hairless like a leaf or the skin of a frog. Nacreous means shiny and rainbow colored like the inside of an oyster shell."
Language,"And to limn something means to draw the outline of or to be highlighted in light. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I don't literally mean that I've got a bear. That would be extremely sweet. Love a bear, love bear's whole thing with the snacking and the sleeping and the eating of fish, but no. A bear of is a figurative expression that means something difficult. So a bear of a lesson is a difficult lesson and that's what we're talking about today. Not bears, sorry, but non-literal uses of language, which we call figurative language or figures of speech. Figurative language says one thing but means another."
Language,"I could say that my colleague Allison is an eagle-eyed editor and when I say that I don't mean that she literally has an eagle's eyes in her head. That would be a terrifying achievement of medical science. No, I'm saying that she is sharp and attentive in the same way that an eagle is. So I'm saying something that is not literally true in order to express something that is true, that Allison is good at editing. Would you call that a lie? I'm not sure I would."
Language,"It's just a non-literal way of expressing myself. So, having gotten the question of whether or not I'm a dirty rotten liar out of the way, let's talk about some different varieties of figurative language. First, the simile. A simile is a comparison between two things that uses like or as. If I were really hungry, I could say that my stomach was gurgling like a tar pit or that I was as hungry as a ravenous wolf, and again, neither of these things are literally true."
Language,"If my stomach were making actual tar pit noises, I would probably need to go to a hospital. But what do those examples tell you about the way that I, the speaker, think about my hunger? Animals and people get stuck in tar pits, they're gloppy, they pull things into them, they slow things down. Sorry T-Rex. Therefore, I'm saying that my hunger is slowing me down. Or, if I'm comparing myself to a wolf, you can imagine me looking lean and desperate, saliva dripping from my jaws at the mere thought of food."
Language,"I could really go for a cheese danish come to think of it. So that's simile. The second figure of speech I wanna talk about today is the metaphor. And what's a metaphor? Cows and sheep! Sorry, I couldn't help it. No, a metaphor is not a meadow for. Metaphors are another way of comparing two things, but this time there's no like or as. We're walking this language tightrope without a net now."
Language,"You aren't signaling with like or as that you're making a figurative comparison, so you have to use context to communicate clearly. At the beginning of this video I said this was going to be a bear of a lesson. That's a metaphor. There's a Linda Ronstadt country song from the 70s, called ""Love is a Rose,"" which is all about how to take care of a relationship through the metaphor of tending a flower with thorns on it."
Language,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person."
Language,"To say that differently, it's ascribing human characteristics to non-living things. The wind howled through the mountains. The car grumbled as I threw it into gear. The storm raged. These are things that people do, but I'm applying that language to inanimate things, like wind and cars and storms in order to express the way these things are behaving. The car is not literally grumbling, ""Aw man, I can't believe David has to drive me today."" It's making noises that I am choosing to identify as unhappy."
Language,"The greatest kind of figurative language in the entire universe is hyperbole. By exaggerating, I'm expressing emphasis and importance. This summer, I'm going to read a million books and eat a literal actual ton of hot dogs. This is not true. In fact, this is impossible. That is too many hot dogs, those are too many books, each of which are sentences I never expected to say, but I'm trying to express my enthusiasm for both books and encased meats, and I'm doing that by being, you know, extra."
Language,"The final kind of expressive language I wanna talk about today isn't exactly figurative language, it's the language of allusions and references. Where you make comparisons to characters or events from literature, or movies, or culture. Also note that it's allusion with an A, as opposed to illusion with an I. An illusion with an I is like a magic trick. Here are some examples of allusions. Oh, you'd have to be Superman to lift that fallen tree. Or, you have a Gollum-like obsession with that stuffed animal."
Language,"Now these comparisons only work if the person you're talking to understands the reference. Superman has super strength, Gollum, from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" can't stop talking about how much he loves this one object, the ring. If you don't know the reference, then it's all just noise. One tip is to read up on mythology. You'd be surprised how many times ancient gods, like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo come up as you read. So that's what we're working with here. Simile, love is like a rose."
Language,"Metaphor, love is a rose. Personification, my car grumbled. Hyperbole, my mom grounded me for eight trillion years. And allusion, I feel mightier than Hercules. That's figurative language folks. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"How do we know that though? How did J. R. R. Tolkien, as an author, develop that theme in the text? How can we go deeper, beyond that headline of the Ring equals the dangers of absolute power? Good readers can look at a whole text from beginning to end and identify where the author purposefully chose words, included details, or directed action that develops or reveals the overall theme."
Language,"It's not just that characters say, ""Oh, no, the Ring's super-dangerous."" In fact, I believe in ""The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf says, ""No, with that power, ""I should have power too great and terrible. ""And over me, the Ring could gain a power ""still greater and more deadly. ""Do not tempt me!"" The characters say that, they do, but it's also about how they behave around the thing."
Language,"It's how the plot is shaped around this object and how a group of people come together to identify this Ring as a dangerous, magical artifact that needs to be destroyed for the good of the world. It's not just dialogue. It's also descriptions by the author and actions taken by the characters."
Language,"So let's go through some of the ways that an author can develop theme within a story, with the important caveat that you won't always be able to detect a theme in a text until you're already finished reading it for the first time. This, to me, is one of the great pleasures of rereading. You've already worked hard to get an understanding of the text, so now you can go back and pick up all the stuff you might not have noticed the first time."
Language,"So one way to develop theme is through the repeated use of a symbol or an object. The Ring in ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great example because characters are always talking about it. But it could really be anything, a design, an object, an animal. Imagine a story about a child who wants to grow up to be an engineer that develops airplanes. And throughout this story, birds keep showing up, birds on the protagonist's windowsill, her favorite teacher's bird earrings, maybe she has a best friend named Robin."
Language,"And from that, we can see the idea of flight is a theme in this story, and all of these bird-related things go back to this character's desire to take flight. Changes in setting are a fine way to develop themes. How is a location portrayed? How does it match with the way characters feel or behave when they appear in these locations? Imagine a character who desperately wants to be alone. So at a tense portion in the story, she flees to a distant mountaintop."
Language,"When she gets there, what's the weather like? Is it cold, snowy, and forbidding on the mountain? Is it an active volcano, bubbling with lava? Is it clear, peaceful, full of snowdrops and mountain goats? What would an author be trying to say with those decisions? How should we, the reader, feel about that character's solitude? If it's snowy and forbidding, is it a symbol of the character's coldness, of their hardening up? Does the volcano reflect the character's explosive potential? Or does the beauty of the lonely mountaintop mean this was the right decision for the character to take? Dialogue that repeatedly references a similar idea can be a way to develop theme."
Language,"When characters mention something a lot, it's probably because the author is thinking about it and maybe wanted to build it intentionally into the story. Imagine a teenager in Ancient Rome who's preoccupied with honor and his family name and how he's worried he won't live up to the achievements of his ancestors. If that's something that he's insecure about, he might think about it often or talk about the concept of honor or the social standing of his family."
Language,"You can also see this presented as explicit lessons by a sage character, usually older and wise. Think of Moana's grandmother or of Yoda. They'll say something explicit like, ""Go do the thing your heart wants, Moana,"" or, ""Trust that the energy of the universe ""will make you a really good space wizard, Luke."" I'm paraphrasing here. Or think of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" saying, ""There's no place like home."" She says it again and again. The words are so powerful that they're used as a magic spell."
Language,"And words so powerful that they become magic is really just another way to say theme. It doesn't need to be said aloud to be thematic. Some of the most powerful moments in storytelling come from action, not just dialogue. Momentous character decisions, like Maui giving up his powers to save Moana or Harry Potter's climactic battle with Voldemort, are chock-full of themes, self-sacrifice, the power of love, the importance of honesty. Some of these themes can be expressed without speaking a single word."
Language,"And I should be clear. Sometimes you need to finish the story before you can look back on it and understand how parts of it contribute to the theme. You might need to get some distance before you can see how all of the pieces fit together. If something really sticks with me, sometimes I like to go back and reread parts of a book once I've gotten a sense of its theme, to see how the author has threaded theme through the text."
Language,"Now, if you look very closely at the videos I make here at Khan Academy, if you really squint your eyes and listen carefully, you'll notice that all of them share the same theme, which is you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"When you read, or when you interact with any kind of fiction, watch carefully for how characters change over time."
Language,"How do characters in a text interact with each other? Does the way a character react to events change over the course of the story? What's changed and why? One of my favorite pieces of fiction of all time is ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" and while he isn't the main character, I think the character of Prince Zuko has one of the best illustrations of character change across the course of the show."
Language,"So spoilers ahoy! But Zuko goes from being an antagonist in the first few seasons, to officially joining the protagonists, the good guys, in the final season of the show. I appreciate how the creators of the show map Zuko's growth and change, because we can see him unlearning old, bad habits and taking on new, more productive ways of behaving as the show progresses."
Language,"He fundamentally changes as a person, and it's the result of a lot of hard work on his part and a lot of love and patience from the people who care about him. Zuko is what is called a dynamic character, which is to say that he changes throughout the story. This is the opposite of a static character, who does not change."
Language,"There's a running gag in the ""Avatar"" series about this one hapless cabbage merchant who keeps on showing up in various cities only to have the protagonists knock his cabbage cart over again and again. Pretty much the only thing he says in the course of the whole show is his catchphrase, ""My cabbages!"" He doesn't learn, he doesn't grow, he only suffers. Cabbage guy, static character, Zuko, dynamic character."
Language,"Many main characters are dynamic, but secondary and background characters, like the cabbage guy are static. So what causes character change in stories? Other people and events. Let's take a look at an example from our website, ""Oscar's Musical Odyssey."" Oscar begins the story by telling his friends on the soccer team that he can't hang out with them that night, he's gotta go to the symphony with his parents."
Language,"His teammates mock him and he feels bad: Oscar was hesitant to say it out loud, as he knew exactly what would happen when his friends found out where he was going. ""I have to go to the symphony tonight,"" he said quietly. The water in Kevin's mouth exploded into the air, propelled by the laughter that closely followed. ""The symphony, hey fellas,"" Kevin exclaimed, as his voice rose to address everyone within ear shot."
Language,"""Guess where El Capitan Rico over here is going? ""He's gonna go sip tea and listen to the symphony!"" Instantly the other soccer guys joined in mocking Oscar. ""I didn't know you had a thing for old gringo music,"" laughed Lorenzo. ""What's next, bro,"" shouted Juan, ""watching the evening news in your bathrobe?"" ""What kind of soccer player goes to the symphony?"" said Javier. Oscar sighed. He knew this would happen."
Language,"although he loved the camaraderie he had with the guys on the soccer team, the amount of grief he was going to get over a stupid night out with his parents was going to be rough, very rough. While Oscar almost always felt tight with this group, this was stirring up some feelings of isolation within him. So this is how Oscar reacts. He's hesitant, he's embarrassed because of how his friends feel about his symphony plans. They're not even his plans, his parents are making him go."
Language,"Good readers ask themselves how do characters treat each other? Oscar's friends think listening to classical music is something for old white dudes or fancy tea-drinking nerds, but whatever it is, it's definitely not for soccer players. But then Oscar attends the symphony and he is bewitched by what he hears. The experience changes him."
Language,"So we can ask how do events change how characters behave? Well, let's return to the text: On the way home Oscar's mom said, ""I know this wasn't what you would have chosen for tonight, ""but I hope you enjoyed it."" ""I thought it was great,"" said Oscar, ""I had no idea, I was so wrapped up in what the guys ""were saying about me that I didn't give it a chance. ""I bet they would love this music,"" he said. ""Maybe,"" said his dad, ""but if they don't, does it matter?"" And that's when Oscar understood something."
Language,"His whole identity didn't have to be defined by only one or two things. Who he was could be a mix, in interwoven harmony of many things. We can look to the text to provide evidence of Oscar's change. He has this moment of clarity in the car after the symphony. He realizes he doesn't have to be either a soccer player or a guy who enjoys symphonies, he can be both at once."
Language,"So when you're evaluating a character, ask yourself for specific choices that characters make, dialogue exchanges, or interactions with other characters, or responses to story events. Compare similar events at different points of the story. Does a character react in the same way at the story's beginning versus how they might react in the middle or near the end of it? If no, what's changed and why? If you can answer those questions, congratulations! You've identified the dynamic character."
Language,You can learn anything. David out. My cabbages!.
Language,"So science fiction is a genre, fairy tales are a genre, mysteries are a genre. Each one of these types of stories has certain elements that you gradually come to expect from them. Fantasy stories have magic spells and imaginary creatures. Romance stories have lots of smooching. Mystery stories have a crime and a person who tries to solve it. You can call these tropes, you can call these style elements but certain genres have certain expectations embedded in them."
Language,"The more you read of a genre, the more your expectations are shaped for that genre. When a story begins with the phrase, ""Once upon a time,"" and ends with ""and they lived happily ever after,"" you know you're looking at a fairy tale. We all carry with us a unique collection of impressions and expectations. It's your background knowledge, your schema. If you think of your brain as a closet, then schema is the hooks and clothes hangers inside that closet."
Language,"You can put a new shirt on a clothes hanger, you can hang pants or a skirt on a clothes hanger, but if you wanted to hang up a dress, you might need one of those fabric-covered hangers so it doesn't slip. And if you wanna store shoes in your closet, you might need to get a shoe rack or one of those hanging shoe organizers."
Language,"Just as different clothing items require different, you know, closet infrastructure like hangers or shoe racks, your schema, your background knowledge, informs the sort of literature you know how to read. That's a weird sentiment to express, I think, but it's true. The first time you read a book in a particular genre, you're forming an impression of that genre. And that impression gets refined or revised with every similar book you read after the first."
Language,"Reading widely across many genres of fiction expands your brain closet. But let's be clear here. Not every book is connected with every other book. And when you try to apply something you learned in one story to another story, it may not work. For example, in 20th century detective fiction, there is a recurring theme or trope that dates to the 1930s: the butler did it, which is to say that if there's a murder that takes place at a fancy manor house, there's a good chance that the butler is the murderer."
Language,"But if you go into every mystery set at a fancy manor house assuming that the butler is the guilty party, you'll be wrong a lot. Famously, in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, everyone did it. Every suspect in the mystery is responsible in some way for the murder in the title."
Language,"It's an enormous conspiracy, and Christie plays with the readers' assumptions as we go through the story, knowing that you, as a person who has probably read a mystery before, or who is at least familiar with the form, has an expectation that there are only one or two culprits, only one or two people that did the murder to the guy on the train."
Language,"And look, I apologize for spoilers for a story from 1934, but you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs, you know what I mean? Anyway, it's neat to look at the way that an author can play with the expectations of genre, how an author might anticipate a reader's schema and play with that. Something that blew my mind when I was in school was the idea that Star Wars was a western, or at least takes many of its cues from classic pulp western movies. Let's draw a little Venn diagram."
Language,"All right, so over here, we've got Star Wars and over here we've got the western movie genre. Here are some things that Star Wars has that westerns don't have. Space wizards like the Jedi and Sith, magic like the force, or space ships. Here's some things that western movies have that Star Wars movie's don't, by and large, have. Western movies have horses, they tend to have cowboys, and then tend to take place in settings like the western United States and Mexico."
Language,"But here's our overlap, all right, so both Star Wars and western movies have bar fights, both Star Wars and western movies have bounty hunters, and both the Star Wars films and western films tend to have a lot of desert settings. That could be the desert planet of Tatooine from Star Wars, or Monument Valley in the US state of Texas, or the Mexican state of Durango in western films."
Language,"Mind you, you could also make a separate Venn diagram between Star Wars and samurai movies because Star Wars also borrows liberally from those. This is a great activity for analysis. Take two stories that you love and compare their theme, settings, and characters, and see if there's something you can find in common between them. You may discover connections you didn't expect. As I've mentioned before, good readers read widely."
Language,"They read lots of books and they let what they know about one genre, their schema of the genre, help them anticipate and make connections when they read a new book. The more you read, the more schema you build, the easier and more interesting those connections will become. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Hey, what's up readers? David here. I'm taking advantage of the cold that I have by doing my serious detective voice in order to teach you about inferences. (phone ringing) Hold on, let me get that. Hi, this is David. I'm in the middle of doing a video. Now isn't a great time. - [Man On Phone] Hello, I have information about what an inference is. -    Oh, oh that's great. Cool, follow me over to the next screen."
Language,"What is an inference, please? - [Man On Phone] An inference is a conclusion that you make based on clues given in a piece of writing. It's more than a guess, but it's not just an observation either. -    Great, thank you. Was that all you needed? - [Man On Phone] Yeah, that was my only thing. -    All right, thanks, bye. - [Man On Phone] Goodbye. -    So an inference is a conclusion that you draw from writing."
Language,"It's an idea that you pull from a sentence or a passage that isn't literally printed there. It's the detective work of reading, finding clues that help you make sense of what's being said. I feel like we're kind of getting bogged down in theory land so let's take a look at an example. I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. There's my snow fort. It's a D on the flag to represent me. There's me little hot cocoa, couple marshmallows floating in there, my Khan Academy mug."
Language,"They don't make Khan Academy mugs. I want a Khan Academy mug. Okay, so what conclusions can we draw from these two sentences? I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. Beautiful, brilliant, enormous. Then I came inside and had a big mug of hot chocolate. Same deal, brilliant, beautiful, enormous. What conclusions can I draw about this situation? Well if you're making things out of snow and then you're coming inside and having hot chocolate, it's probably not the height of summer."
Language,"One inference that I can draw from these two sentences together is that it is winter time when this sentence takes place. Where I live, these are not activities that one pursues in the height of summer outside. I'm looking for clues within the text. Snow fort, I'm outside, I came inside and then I had hot chocolate which is not traditionally a beverage that is consumed when it's warm out. Let's take a look at another example."
Language,"This paragraph is part of a longer passage that is about a young ballet dancer named Michaela. Michaela danced so wonderfully that she was awarded a scholarship to attend the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School at the American Ballet Theater. That was only the beginning of her dancing success. When she was 17, Michaela danced with the Dance Theater of Harlem professional company. Later, she joined the Dutch National Junior Company. Today, Michaela is a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet."
Language,"So very quickly without getting bogged down in this passage, what are some conclusions, what are some inferences that we can draw about Michaela? Who is Michaela? What do we know about her? We know that she's a dancer. We know that she's very good at it, right? She danced so wonderfully that she got a scholarship. So I'm gonna say Michaela is very talented and we know that her talent led to success because her getting the scholarship was only the beginning of her dancing success."
Language,"We can see from the passage that she was part of at least three different dance companies, the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Dutch National Junior Company, and as a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet today. So I'm gonna say that Michaela is a very hard worker. Now notice no where in the passage does it say Michaela is a very talented, hard working dancer. Just like in the previous example, it didn't say, it was winter outside so I made a snow fort."
Language,"What the skill of inference is requires you to be a detective and take your magnifying glass to the passage to discover clues. Imagine you're a detective like this dog. He's wearing a little deer stalker cap. Let's call him, let's call him Sherlock Bones, the famous dog detective that I just made up. I feel like Sherlock Holmes is always smoking a pipe so I'm gonna give this dog like a, I don't know a bone or a piece of rawhide or something."
Language,"Imagine that you are a detective or a dog detective if you like and every time you read a text, let's say a book, that you are searching for clues within it. What you're doing when you make an inference is you are taking the information that you already know about the world and the places and people in it and how they behave and what they look like and what they do and you're applying that knowledge to the text."
Language,"When do people build snowmen? When do people build snow forts? When do they drink hot cocoa? In the winter time. An important thing to remember though is that inferring is not guessing. Any time you make an inference, you have to be pulling it directly from the text. That's your jumping off point. It can't just be a wild guess out of no where. It comes from information that you've got there on the page. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go eat my weight in cough drops."
Language,"You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"And as readers, we use those examples to grab hold of those ideas and better understand them. If I tell you that I have weird hobbies, I need to back up that statement with some examples. I need to illustrate just how weird they are. So if I say my hobbies include going for walks, reading books, and drinking tea, those are very ordinary interests, they're not weird at all. Not a good example. I need to be more selective and better support my claim that my hobbies are strange."
Language,"So instead, I could say my hobbies include puppeteering, making bubble tea from scratch, and learning to read Middle English. Well, now we're getting somewhere, right? Now you're starting to understand just how much of a weirdo this David guy is."
Language,"What is the function of an example? What does it do? When you come across an example, ask yourself, what purpose does this example serve? Why did the author introduce this detail here? How does this example connect to the text overall? Does it form a pattern with other details? And if so, what does that pattern tell me? And finally we ask ourselves, does this example raise other questions? Let's look at a text and evaluate its examples. Here's an excerpt from a piece about the author J.M."
Language,"Barrie, the creator of ""Peter Pan"". ""Barrie didn't have just one version ""of the ""Peter Pan"" story, ""he made changes along the way. ""For example, he learned ""that children were copying Peter Pan ""and trying to jump out of their beds to fly. ""Some of them were getting badly injured! ""So Barrie added the rule that in order to fly, ""you had to have fairy or pixie dust ""blown on you first. ""By adding this rule, ""J.M."
Language,"Barrie was trying to help children understand ""that flying is magical, ""so that they wouldn't try to do it themselves and get hurt."" So the author is saying that J.M. Barrie changed ""Peter Pan"" and then he gives an example of the change. Let's zero in on that example and ask those questions that we just went over. So for this example, what is its purpose? Well, it does a couple of things. It shows us that J.M. Barrie was willing to make changes to his story after it was initially published."
Language,"It shows us that the author wants to portray Barrie as a responsible person. He heard about children injuring themselves by copying his story and so he made an effort to prevent that by changing a detail in the story. It's also a pretty specific example that I can picture. I can imagine kids jumping off of tall things and getting hurt, and Barrie feeling worried about that. And because I can picture it, I can better understand it, which helps me better understand the overall text."
Language,"I only excerpted a small portion of this text. So I'm not gonna ask how it connects to the text overall. But this example does raise other questions for me, like what other children's fiction accidentally encourages people to do dangerous stunts at home? Like jumping off your bed? Examples are really powerful! They can shape a reader's impression of a topic. As a writer, employ them tactically to help develop someone's understanding."
Language,"Recognize that when a series of examples comes in sequence, it tells a story, and story is an incredibly powerful tool. Use it responsibly. As a reader, understand the power that examples have and pay attention to how they're being used. A well-chosen example or two can create a false narrative. As readers, we are engaged in a push and pull with writers, especially when they are trying to convince us of something. Make a writer work to convince you. Read with a skeptical attitude."
Language,"And if you can do that, you can learn anything. David, out.."
Language,"It's like a series of jumps. Listening to myself say that, it doesn't feel very clear to me. At least it's certainly less clear than this moving image of a galloping horse. Sometimes the most efficient way to express information is to present it visually, to see it in order to best understand it. And so we're going to talk today about graphs and charts, your friends and mine. This video is no longer about horses. I apologize if I gave that impression."
Language,"I did give a pretty obvious title when I said quantitative information in texts. But to those of you who I've misled, I'm sorry. Now, graphs are one of many ways we can make visual representations of data, information you can see, news you can use. And I guess a question that follows from that is why do it? Why make a graph and a chart? What does that have to do with writing? Well, visualizing data can make an argument stronger."
Language,"Let's say my neighborhood is having a bake sale to raise money for, I don't know, a carnival. And some of my neighbors have peanut allergies, so I want to write to the neighborhood council to say let's make sure that the baked goods don't have peanuts in them so the whole neighborhood can participate without fear of having an allergic attack. That's supposed to be a peanut. I realize it kinda looks like a dog treat, but let's pretend that's a peanut."
Language,"Now, good readers know that data is important to informational text, so as a writer, I wanna make sure that I'm backing up my claims with a chart. Here's the text of the letter I'd send to my neighborhood council: Dear Neighborhood Council, I'm writing to ask that you officially ban peanuts and tree nuts from the baked goods on offer during our upcoming carnival bake sale. Over a fifth of residents surveyed reported some kind of food allergy. Please see attached graph."
Language,"If we want to have their full participation in this fundraiser, we cannot permit foods that will send them to the hospital. All my best, David. Now, let's take a look at that graph. These are made-up numbers in a made-up situation. But let's say I interviewed 50 of my neighbors, and 40 of them here report no allergies, but 10 of them do. So we can have this bar graph that breaks down those allergies by type. One person is allergic to strawberries. Two people are allergic to peanuts."
Language,"Four people are allergic to tree nuts, like pecans or walnuts. And three people have multiple food allergies. And then we have this bar here that shows all the folks that don't have food allergies. That's the other 40. To put it another way, here's a pie chart of that same data set showing just how many people in the neighborhood have allergies in total. It's just a different way of looking at it."
Language,"This is all the same data, but we can see that the percentage of people surveyed who have allergies adds up to 20% of the total. Something that's in the letter but not the graphs is the idea that these are very serious allergies. If the wrong person ate a peanut, they could have a medical emergency. If the council were to look at just the graph alone, they might say, ""Eh, it's not that many people. ""Peanuts are great, let's include them."" But combined with the text, the stakes become more clear."
Language,And they may better understand the consequences of having nuts at the bake sale. And something that's in the graph that isn't in the letter is the breakdown of allergies by type. Maybe the council could decide that the one person with a strawberry allergy is an acceptable risk and that strawberry baked goods are kind of obvious-looking and easy to avoid in a way that brownies with walnuts in them aren't.
Language,"This visual information allows the neighborhood council to get my point more efficiently than just the words alone. It helps me express a sort of complicated idea that peanuts and other allergens in the bake sale might constitute too much of a risk to my neighbors and that they shouldn't be allowed. Now, there are other questions like is this a representative data set? But that's a question that can be better answered by our statistics course. For now, think about it this way."
Language,"As a reader, your job is to look at everything that is on the page, not just the text. Then think about what both the data and the words do for your understanding. Data and informational text are two great tastes that go great together. One can support the other and vice versa, you know, like chocolate and peanut butter. Oh, no, sorry, bad example, like chocolate and sunflower butter. You know what I mean. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Definitely, consult your parent or guardian. But in the film, you witness four distinct accounts from four separate people. And each person remembers what happened very differently. The stories contradict each other. And by the end of the film, it's still not completely clear who did what to whom. Now, this raises an interesting philosophical question."
Language,"What is the truth? How does a person's perspective their point of view, their background, and their beliefs change the way they interpret events or ideas? As readers, it's our job to engage with that question by reading and synthesizing multiple accounts of events. When we read multiple accounts, we grow closer to understanding a fuller picture of what happened. Now, we've talked before about the distinction between firsthand and secondhand accounts. So in 1912, the Titanic sank."
Language,"Someone was aboard and survived to tell their story has a firsthand account. A historian who writes an account of the Titanic has a secondhand account and can incorporate multiple perspectives. But even among the firsthand accounts, you can have wildly different stories. Compare someone who was working in the ship's boiler room to a rich passenger in a fancy suite. They would've had very different experiences of surviving or, ugh, not surviving, a shipwreck."
Language,"And it's important to get in a range of perspectives in order to get that full picture. If you ever watched any kind of sports game, you've probably seen an argument like this. That's a baseball player arguing with an umpire. Umpires and referees have one perspective on a sports game, ""You were out!"" And the players have another, ""I was safe!"" They both saw the same event, the same play, but they see it differently because their perspectives are so different."
Language,"Now, we can take this understanding to the texts that we read. Who's the author of a text? What's their perspective? And what informs that perspective? The baseball player wants to be declared safe, the umpire wants to adhere to the rules as strictly as possible, but maybe there also an umpire that likes to call players out because they like having that power over people. Let's go back to the example of the crime scene from the beginning of the video. Imagine there's been a car crash."
Language,"Now, below are two different accounts of the same crash. From the driver's perspective, ""I was driving along, hands on the wheel, ""eyes on the road, when suddenly, ""out of nowhere, this kid on a bike ""comes racing out in front of me! ""I swerve to avoid them ""and ran my car into this tree. ""It's the biker's fault my car is wrecked!"" Now, here's the cyclist's perspective. ""I was biking along, in the bike lane, ""when I look over and this driver is texting, ""not looking where they're going."
Language,"""They were weaving into the bike lane, ""so I moved out into the road ""to keep from being hit. ""They must have panicked because they crashed ""their car right into a tree. ""I'm lucky the driver didn't hit me! ""They should pay attention when they drive"" Same situation, very different perspectives. Now, if we only had an additional eye witness to tell us what they saw. That might clear things up. The more accounts you have, the more confident you can feel in the accuracy of the facts."
Language,"So ask yourself who's writing the text. Are they a fancy passenger on a cruise ship or are they shoveling coal in the boiler room? Are they a baseball player or a baseball umpire? It is only by comparing multiple accounts that we'll get to the bottom of things. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I legitimately wrote a book about this a few years ago, and to research this book about the world's deadliest animals, I read a lot of other books and sources. So I wanna use this experience to show you why it's important to read more than one source on a subject. Okay, so why do it? Why not say all right, I read one text about the Pacific Blue-ringed octopus. Why do I need to read two or three or 20? There are a couple reasons. Let's start with the first, expert knowledge."
Language,"If you wanna know all about octopuses, you can't just look at a single piece of writing say, ""Bam, got it, know all I need to know ""I am the knower of octopus facts."" No, you can't do it. If you want to become an expert, you need to be able to say well, this book says the Pacific octopus toxin can stop your heart. But this one says that you can tell whether or not an octopus is frightened by its color. Reason number two to read multiple sources, helping to determine or know what's true."
Language,"Sometimes people get things wrong. It helps to read more than one text to make sure you're getting as many perspectives or ideas as you can. Sometimes information from an old book might be outdated or information from a new book hasn't yet been proven to be true. Reading different texts can help you decide what you think about a topic, or even whether or not something is true."
Language,"We can answer questions like, what is the deadliest animal? Or how do we even define deadliest? Reason number three, to read multiple texts on the same topic, supporting an argument. The more information you can get about a topic, the more support you can give to your own opinions or arguments. I think that this animal is the most dangerous because I've read a bunch of different works about dangerous animals and I can support it with evidence, you would say."
Language,"If I were to say that bears are more dangerous than I don't really know what I drew, I thought I was trying to draw a sheep but I think it's a hedgehog. If I were to try to argue that bears are more dangerous than hedgehogs, I would use multiple sources to provide evidence for those claims. Bears are taller, bears are heavier, bears have sharper teeth, bears are stronger. Hedgehogs or sheep are cuter and cuddlier sorry to bears."
Language,"It's important to recognize that different books have different arguments in them. Every book has a different angle, right? Sometimes it's obvious like a book with the title, ""Deadly animals and how to hunt them"" versus a book called ""Deadly animals and how to protect their habitats."" People have opinions and people make books. So, that means that books can have opinions too."
Language,"Are these animals cool or terrifying? Should they be hunted or protected? Reading one text on a subject doesn't give you the full story. It's important to be able to read more than one text, compare them and then decide what you think from that. It helps to have a purpose in mind too as you read. Oh, and to answer your unspoken question, the deadliest animals on earth are definitely human beings but in a close second place is hippos. Those guys will bite you in half. So you know, watch out for hippos."
Language,You can learn anything. David out..
Language,"At the time of this recording, I'm 31 and I run into new and confusing words every day. I read a lot and it's always a fun challenge to run into words like, I don't know, glabrous or limned or nacreous. I know a lot about language and even I have trouble figuring out what those words mean on their own. So it's important to rely on context, the language that surrounds the word. Let's say you're reading a text and you come across a sentence that has a word in it you don't recognize."
Language,"Here's a bit from a passage about the famous chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. ""Jane Goodall arrived at Tanzania's ""Gombee Stream National Park in 1960. ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers. ""After all, she had not yet been to college."" So let's pause on unconventional. What does that word mean? Well, let me give you some ideas, that's the memory aid I use to keep it straight."
Language,"IDEAS, it stands for inference, definition, example, antonym, synonym, I-D-E-A-S, IDEAS, which are all different kinds of context clues. Every word will have a different context, so you might need to vary your approach. The way this snippet is written let's try inference first, then I'll rewrite the sentence a few times to show you the other methods. Okay, the I in IDEAS, inference. We can draw conclusions from the context."
Language,"If we don't know what unconventional means, we can take a look at the rest of the sentence or other nearby sentences to figure it out. Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal."
Language,"And because I'm making an inference about this word's meaning I wanna keep an eye out for it in other places to see if I can confirm or revise that working definition later. D - definition. Context clues like these will just give you the definition of the word in question. So a good example of that would be: ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers."
Language,"""She hadn't been to college yet, ""and this made her different and unexpected."" Different and unexpected is a great definition for the word unconventional. This style of context clue occurs when the author expects a word to be unfamiliar to you and builds in a guide for you right there in the text. The E in IDEAS stands for example, and this is somewhere between inference and definition. If the author describes Goodall as unconventional, they'll go on to talk about something unconventional that Goodall did."
Language,"""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among animal researchers. ""For one thing, she hadn't been to college yet."" So this is very similar to that initial sentence, except for the transition phrase for one thing, which is a way to set up examples. Antonym - an antonym is a word whose meaning is the opposite of another word, like how night is the opposite of day, or how love is the opposite of hate."
Language,"So if there's an example in the text of what Jane Goodall was not, we can use that to figure out what she was. So let's say the passage said: ""Goodall was unconventional. ""She didn't conform, and she wasn't ordinary."" There we have two antonyms and our answer. Similarly, synonym just means write another word with the same meaning similar to a definition. ""Jane Goodall was unconventional. ""She was a nonconformist."
Language,"""She went against the grain."" You can see that I had to rewrite the sentences each time to apply to each context clue strategy, which shows me that you won't find all five context clues every time you need to search for a word's meaning. You need to find the approach that makes the most sense in context. See what I did there, ah huh? And failing that, you can always look up an unfamiliar word in a dictionary. I love to do that."
Language,"I think that's great, but I also feel a sense of victory when I correctly figure out what a new word means, when I've put it together from context. And maybe if I'm still curious, I look it up later and then I turn out to be right, and I'm all like ""Victory at sea, I did it!"" Oh, and if you were curious, glabrous means smooth and hairless like a leaf or the skin of a frog. Nacreous means shiny and rainbow colored like the inside of an oyster shell."
Language,"And to limn something means to draw the outline of or to be highlighted in light. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I'm not gonna say that you need to be able to speak modern Greek or read ancient Latin in order to understand English but many complicated words are made up of little language building blocks that we can break apart, using the power of understanding! (explosion) That was cool right? I'm cool? I'm cool. I'm gonna introduce some vocabulary about vocabulary now, so brace yourselves. There's this idea of a root word. Take the word dent, which is Latin for tooth."
Language,"From that root word, we can get the adjective dental, which means about teeth, or the noun dentist, which means a person who specializes in teeth, or the noun dentures, which are false teeth. That's what a root is. Now you can also combine roots to make words. The word phot is Greek for light, the root graph comes from the Greek for writing. You put those together, you get photograph or writing with light. It's kind of poetic, isn't it? To this understanding, let us add the idea of an affix."
Language,"Affixes aren't words or roots but they are word particles that convey meaning. Maybe you've heard of prefixes and suffixes, if you have, these are both types of affixes. Prefixes attach at the front end of a word, whereas suffixes attach at the back end. An example of a suffix would be logy, meaning the study of or the science of."
Language,"So we can make a bunch of words with logy, like biology, that's supposed to be a little amoeba; cetology, the study or science of whales; anthropology, the study of human beings; cosmology, the study of the universe. So if you see a logy, it's going to be some kind of science or specialized area of study. A good example of a prefix would be the Greek para, which means alongside."
Language,"So a paralegal is someone who works alongside lawyers, a paramedic works alongside doctors and if your house is haunted, you don't need a normal pest control expert to get rid of the ghost, you need a paranormal pest control expert, one that is alongside but not within normalcy and thus, you call the Ghostbusters. So what does all of this mean for you as a reader? Well when I encounter a word I don't understand, it's like I had been walking down a hallway and was suddenly confronted with a locked door."
Language,"It's frustrating but the magic, the power of studying roots, prefixes and suffixes is that when you master a small handful of them, you suddenly become the proud owner of a ring of keys. Doors fling themselves open for you, you can go anywhere, you can understand any concept, any piece of vocabulary. An army of locked doors fall off their hinges all at once when you approach. Don't believe me? I'll show you. While excavating the foundation for a geothermal plant, my companion Neha found a fossil."
Language,"Upon closer inspection, she realized it was a pterodactyl. Wow, lot of big words in that little paragraph. Now, watch this. Excavating, so hollowing out. Foundation, bottom-making. Geothermal, Earth heat. Companion, so this is someone you would eat bread with, so bread together, who do we eat bread together with? Our friends. Inspection, looking in or closer and pterodactyl, pter means wing, dactyl means finger, it is a prehistoric winged reptile."
Language,"So while she was digging in the ground to prepare the bottom of a plant that gets electricity from the heat of the Earth, my friend Neha found a fossil. When she looked at it closely, she realized it was a flying reptile with fingery wings. Do you see what I mean about keys? Studying roots and affixes gives me the power to look at those words and crack them apart. You're not so big now, vocabulary word. You have no power over me! Studying roots, prefixes and suffixes will give you that same power."
Language,"I promise you it is awesome, like, literally it fills me with a sense of awe. The power is yours for the taking. You can learn anything, David out. Okay are we doing those fun history reasons though? Okay, the short version is that first the Romans then some Vikings, then some French Vikings invaded the island of Great Britain a bunch of times over the last 1500 years, shaping the language and making what I like to call French-shaped dents in the Germanic structure of English."
Language,"English is a Germanic language, French is a Romance language, meaning not that it is full of love but that it is an offshoot of Latin or you know, Roman. French took root in 11th Century English and merged with it, grafting an enormous amount of Greek and Latin vocabulary on to a German root stock. We often reach for Latin and Greek compounds when we compose new words, which is why we say television in English, which comes from the Greek tele, meaning far away, and the Latin vire, meaning to see."
Language,"If we reached for Germanic roots to make new words, we'd call a television a farseer because indeed, that's what the word is in German, fernsehen. So why do we have Greek and Latin in our vocabulary? Because England was colonized by French speakers almost a thousand years ago. Imagine what English will sound like in another thousand years. Anyway, thanks for coming on this tangent with me. David out for real this time, bye.."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word. This is distinct from denotation, which is more like the dictionary definition of a word. Companion and buddy both have similar denotations. They both mean friend, but companion is a much more formal sounding word than buddy. Which originated as a piece of slang from the 19th century."
Language,"So even though their denotation or their literal definition is the same, they feel different. The connotation of companion is formal while the connotation of buddy is friendly and casual. Good readers pay close attention to the words the author chose to use. They picked those words for a reason. How do those words make you feel? What is the author trying to imply? How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"(tense big band music) Friday was a very straightforward, almost relentless, character and the catchphrase associated with his character was ""Just the facts."" ""All we want are the facts, ma'am,"" was the sort of thing that he would say. And that's what we're talking about today: just the facts. There's this idea called objectivity. That you can talk about something without inserting any opinions which are personal thoughts or beliefs."
Language,"Doing this, being objective, is very difficult; opinions want to creep in. So what does it mean for a summary to be objective? It means it isn't influenced by feelings or opinions, it's not written in the first person, it's about the text, not me, and it's not a judgment or a review of the information. Let's be clear here; it's not bad to have opinions. In my opinion, it is good to have opinions, but they do not have a place in summaries. You can put opinions to use when you analyze or evaluate something."
Language,"When you're looking at summaries and you're trying to determine whether one is objective or not, look for words that cast judgment. Does the writer say something is good or terrible or useful or useless? Let's do this together. I'll take this text and summarize it without any opinions. Polar bears hunt for seals on thick sea ice in the Arctic. As the Earth grows warmer, though, sea ice gets thinner."
Language,"With less stable ground, some hungry polar bears search for food inland, often dangerously close to human environments. Although polar bears usually keep to themselves, a very scared or angry one could attack, and even eat, a human. Several villages have set up polar bear patrols as a result. The patrollers zoom around on snowmobiles, using bright lights and loud noises to scare away polar bears. Hopefully, the polar bears find another snack later on."
Language,"Here's my summary: Climate change causes polar bears to encroach on human habitats to search for food. As a consequence, these villages have set up polar bear patrols to frighten them away. As a person who cares about climate change, as well as the wellbeing of bears and human beings, I have all sorts of opinions about this, but for the purposes of summarizing that paragraph, I have to put them aside. Just the facts, ma'am."
Language,"(Dragnet theme) If you get good enough at making objective summaries, you'll start noticing when opinion creeps into things you expect to be objective. And it won't be obvious like bears are terrible and humans are right to scare them away or climate change ravages bear habitats, sending defenseless bears into the jaws of doom: human villages. But it might be in the way a story is framed. Like, there's a difference between bears move into human habitats and bears are forced into human habitats."
Language,"What causes them to move? Forced by whom or by what? Sometimes what's not in a text can be as important as what's in it. Experiment with this a little. Try summarizing some news articles and see if you can restate the facts of the stories without inserting any opinions. It's a fun challenge and it may expose an opinion where you didn't expect to see it. Objectively, you can learn anything. David out. Constant vigilance!."
Language,"""This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why."" Argument does not sneak, it does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories: data, fact, observable reality. There is a place for pure subjective opinion, and it is the realm of the movie and the restaurant review."
Language,"""I did not like this movie because I didn't laugh at its jokes."" ""I did not enjoy the hamburger I got because I found it too dry for my liking."" This is not what we're talking about today. Obviously, argument is rooted in opinion and subjective personal preferences, but those opinions need to be backed up with evidence. Let's compare arguments for and against a tax on soda."
Language,"Now, this writer argues that sugar contributes to obesity, and therefore, people should be prevented from buying soda, which is full of sugar on the grounds that it is bad for them, let's take a look. The soda tax could alter many people's behavior, causing them to stop buying sugary drinks. Some foods are necessities like milk, eggs, and bread. People will buy them even if the prices increase. Sugary drinks aren't necessary."
Language,"If the price goes up, people will buy fewer sugary drinks and they won't be consuming as much sugar, therefore, the obesity rate will go down. Whereas this author counters that people have a right to make what they see as unhealthy decisions. Soda and other sugary drinks have been targeted because they lack nutrition and are basically just liquid sugar. Most people would agree that proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
Language,"However, do legislators have the right or responsibility to regulate people's sugar intake in order to improve their health? I say, no. All right, let's evaluate these claims. For the first argument in favor of the soda tax, how do we know this is true? What evidence does this author give that this tax will alter people's behavior? What evidence does this author give that sugary drinks aren't seen to be as essential as milk? After all, not everyone can or does drink milk."
Language,"In the piece, the evidence that the author gives us is this table, which shows how much sugar is in soda per serving, but it doesn't use evidence to connect sugar consumption to unhealthy outcomes. All this says is, soda has a lot of sugar. I wanna see evidence, I wanna see studies. How do we know this tax would change behavior? Good readers think through the impacts of an argument."
Language,"If this tax went into effect, what would the consequences be? Are there faults in the author's logic? It might stop some people from buying soda, but in an unfair way. Here's how I'm processing this as a reader. If you take a bottle of soda that previously costs, say $2, and the tax makes it $10, that will make it more difficult to purchase. But to a millionaire, the difference between $2 and $10 is basically nothing. Whereas to a poor or middle class person, that $8 difference adds up pretty quickly."
Language,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary."
Language,"So now I'm asking, whose responsibility is it to determine how much sugar is in a drink? Why is sugar so inexpensive to begin with? Do legislators have a responsibility there? Now we know it's not legal to bottle rat poison and sell it as tea, but whose responsibility is that? What isn't this author saying, and how does not saying it serve their argument? They're not saying what the government could or should do, only what it shouldn't do."
Language,"And this is why I want you to be skeptical whenever you read anyone's argument about anything. You need to figure out what the terms of the debate are. What does the argument assume as a given? What's a problem worth fixing? What are the trade offs that the writer thinks are acceptable? So when you encounter an argument in text, look for the claims, and then look to see if those claims are backed up with data-supported reasoning."
Language,"Is the author using evidence and logic? Do they anticipate objections to their arguments and push back on or incorporate those critiques? Above all else, I want you to remain skeptical. Everyone's selling something, even me. It's just the thing I'm trying to sell you is the fundamental idea that you can learn anything. You've got this, Readers. David out.."
Language,"You should be skeptical of all informational writing until the writer gives you a reason to trust them. Honestly, you should be skeptical of me until I give you a reason to trust me. Who am I, after all? Just some stranger on the internet. Well, that's a little unfair, actually. You probably knew about Khan Academy well before you watched this video, which means you have a sense that the information we teach is reputable or trustworthy."
Language,"So, maybe I'm already at an advantage for you trustworthinesswise, because you associate me with an institution you already have good feelings about. When an author writes for informational purposes, they want you to believe that they're telling the truth, but you can't just accept that on faith. No human being is so important that they can't be bothered to explain themselves. Now, let's be clear, that doesn't mean that everyone you disagree with personally owes you an explanation."
Language,"It just means that you don't have to swallow their arguments hook, line, and sinker. So, how do we move forward? We can't just go around in a nightmarish swirl of misinformation, never knowing whom to trust. That's no good. Society couldn't function. Imagine looking at the weather report and saying, ""I don't believe you!"" And then, walking outside your home in shorts when the forecast calls for snow. That would be terrible, for you."
Language,"The key is to ask yourself, ""Why should you trust the weather forecast?"" forecasters are scientists, specifically meteorologists. Their job is to study weather patterns and make predictions. And that doesn't mean they always get it right, because they're making what amounts to educated guesses about the weather. But their expertise and their access to weather monitoring equipment make them likelier to know what the weather's going to do than the average person would."
Language,"And this is basically the test you should bring to all informational writing. Good readers look for clues to establish trustworthiness, to establish that the author knows what they're talking about, that they've done the research, that they're an expert worth listening to. Someone who hops on YouTube and says, ""Here's why your teachers are lying to you ""about the goblins who live in the moon,"" is someone that warrants some skepticism, a little side-eye."
Language,"Also, how awesome would it be if there were moon goblins? And why would anyone want that information to be kept secret? Okay, when you look at a text, you have to wrap your head around three big things. One, the main idea or the claim. What is the author trying to say, explain or convince you of? Two, the evidence for that claim? What are the facts, details, or other pieces of information that tell us that that claim is true or accurate? And three, the reasoning."
Language,"How the evidence prove that the claim is true? Okay, so let's imagine that this conspiracy guy on YouTube is trying to make the case about those goblins. Let's listen in on his argument. - [YouTuber] I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't! It's actually the tip of an enormous goblin moon base."
Language,"How do I know that? The goblins told me so. I have a special phone line from my house to the moon goblins. And through me, they can answer any questions you've got. Our moon door is always open, the goblins tell me. -    All right, so, what's the claim? Goblins live inside the moon. What's his proof? What we think is a crater on the moon is actually a goblin moon base. What's his reasoning? What backs that up? He says the goblins told him so."
Language,"Now, is that evidence? Or is that just something he's telling us? Well, one way we can know he's probably full of baloney is that only he can talk to the moon goblins. Right, he says he's got a special phone line. They can answer questions through him. We can't talk to the goblins. We can't have access to any of their information. He's behaving like the information is freely out there for anyone, but it isn't. You have to go through him."
Language,"So, can the stuff he's saying be independently verified? That is to say, can anyone other than this person prove that there are moon goblins or that that crater is a moon base? Are there photos or video from those goblins? And if not, why not? This doesn't pass the smell test for me. There's proof, but only I get to see it, is not proof. That's just made up. When it comes to making arguments, you have to show your work. A good writer has to earn the trust of their audience."
Language,"And a good reader has to make a writer work for that trust. ""What does that look like?"" I hear you asking. Excellent question. Let's take a look at a piece that does its homework. Okay, let's read. ""There are some conspiracy theorists ""that claim that NASA's moon landing missions ""in the late 60s and 70s never happened, ""despite the mountain of evidence to the contrary."
Language,"""They claim that the photographs were faked, ""the mission recordings were scripted, ""and the moon rocks were nothing more ""than ordinary earth rocks. ""Perhaps you are among these conspiracists. ""If so, let me prove to you ""that the moon landings took place. ""Perhaps you are skeptical of the US government, ""which was in the middle of the Cold War ""with the Soviet Union and a shooting war in Vietnam. ""Perhaps you believe that any information from NASA ""is therefore suspicious."
Language,"""Fortunately for you, ""there is plenty of third-party evidence ""that Americans traveled to and landed on the moon. ""An observatory in the UK that previously observed ""the Russian launch of the Sputnik probe ""used its radio telescope ""to observe the 1969 moon landing. ""The Bochum Observatory, this one in Germany, ""also confirms that mission."
Language,"""Finally, present-day photos ""from many different space agencies around the world ""have confirmed the presence of footprints, rover tracks, ""and the lunar rovers themselves. ""In order for a moon landing to have been faked, ""the rocket scientist James Michael Longuski ""estimates that more than 400,000 people ""who worked on the projects in some capacity ""would have had to keep the conspiracy a secret."
Language,"""In his 2006 book 'The Seven Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist,' ""Longuski suggests that given how complicated it would be ""to fake such a project, ""it might actually be easier to just go ahead ""and do the moon landing in the first place."" So, if you don't believe the US government, this writer is saying, let's look at some other sources. How do we know those sources are real? Well, we have some names to look into to independently verify it. We've got this rocket scientist."
Language,"We have the name of this German observatory. We could look into and verify these statements. It's not just one guy asserting that there's goblins on the moon. It's someone saying here are some non-NASA sources that can confirm that Americans landed on the moon. Be careful out there. It's a wild world of people who wanna bend your brains and turn you against your neighbors. Use your brain, your heart, and your reading skills to fend them off, as you develop your principles. You've got this, readers."
Language,You can learn anything. David out..
Language,"How do we know that though? How did J. R. R. Tolkien, as an author, develop that theme in the text? How can we go deeper, beyond that headline of the Ring equals the dangers of absolute power? Good readers can look at a whole text from beginning to end and identify where the author purposefully chose words, included details, or directed action that develops or reveals the overall theme."
Language,"It's not just that characters say, ""Oh, no, the Ring's super-dangerous."" In fact, I believe in ""The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf says, ""No, with that power, ""I should have power too great and terrible. ""And over me, the Ring could gain a power ""still greater and more deadly. ""Do not tempt me!"" The characters say that, they do, but it's also about how they behave around the thing."
Language,"It's how the plot is shaped around this object and how a group of people come together to identify this Ring as a dangerous, magical artifact that needs to be destroyed for the good of the world. It's not just dialogue. It's also descriptions by the author and actions taken by the characters."
Language,"So let's go through some of the ways that an author can develop theme within a story, with the important caveat that you won't always be able to detect a theme in a text until you're already finished reading it for the first time. This, to me, is one of the great pleasures of rereading. You've already worked hard to get an understanding of the text, so now you can go back and pick up all the stuff you might not have noticed the first time."
Language,"So one way to develop theme is through the repeated use of a symbol or an object. The Ring in ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great example because characters are always talking about it. But it could really be anything, a design, an object, an animal. Imagine a story about a child who wants to grow up to be an engineer that develops airplanes. And throughout this story, birds keep showing up, birds on the protagonist's windowsill, her favorite teacher's bird earrings, maybe she has a best friend named Robin."
Language,"And from that, we can see the idea of flight is a theme in this story, and all of these bird-related things go back to this character's desire to take flight. Changes in setting are a fine way to develop themes. How is a location portrayed? How does it match with the way characters feel or behave when they appear in these locations? Imagine a character who desperately wants to be alone. So at a tense portion in the story, she flees to a distant mountaintop."
Language,"When she gets there, what's the weather like? Is it cold, snowy, and forbidding on the mountain? Is it an active volcano, bubbling with lava? Is it clear, peaceful, full of snowdrops and mountain goats? What would an author be trying to say with those decisions? How should we, the reader, feel about that character's solitude? If it's snowy and forbidding, is it a symbol of the character's coldness, of their hardening up? Does the volcano reflect the character's explosive potential? Or does the beauty of the lonely mountaintop mean this was the right decision for the character to take? Dialogue that repeatedly references a similar idea can be a way to develop theme."
Language,"When characters mention something a lot, it's probably because the author is thinking about it and maybe wanted to build it intentionally into the story. Imagine a teenager in Ancient Rome who's preoccupied with honor and his family name and how he's worried he won't live up to the achievements of his ancestors. If that's something that he's insecure about, he might think about it often or talk about the concept of honor or the social standing of his family."
Language,"You can also see this presented as explicit lessons by a sage character, usually older and wise. Think of Moana's grandmother or of Yoda. They'll say something explicit like, ""Go do the thing your heart wants, Moana,"" or, ""Trust that the energy of the universe ""will make you a really good space wizard, Luke."" I'm paraphrasing here. Or think of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" saying, ""There's no place like home."" She says it again and again. The words are so powerful that they're used as a magic spell."
Language,"And words so powerful that they become magic is really just another way to say theme. It doesn't need to be said aloud to be thematic. Some of the most powerful moments in storytelling come from action, not just dialogue. Momentous character decisions, like Maui giving up his powers to save Moana or Harry Potter's climactic battle with Voldemort, are chock-full of themes, self-sacrifice, the power of love, the importance of honesty. Some of these themes can be expressed without speaking a single word."
Language,"And I should be clear. Sometimes you need to finish the story before you can look back on it and understand how parts of it contribute to the theme. You might need to get some distance before you can see how all of the pieces fit together. If something really sticks with me, sometimes I like to go back and reread parts of a book once I've gotten a sense of its theme, to see how the author has threaded theme through the text."
Language,"Now, if you look very closely at the videos I make here at Khan Academy, if you really squint your eyes and listen carefully, you'll notice that all of them share the same theme, which is you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"If ordinary writing is like talking, then poetry is like singing. Poetry is a way of making art with language. Poems can express huge ideas or feelings. They can be about the sound or rhythm of language, or they can be goofy, little jokes. It's like any other kind of writing. Poems can be about everything or they can be about nothing at all. They can be funny, or sad, or sweet. They can rhyme. They can very much not rhyme. And all of that is, in my opinion, absolutely wonderful."
Language,"I think of some poems as condensed ideas that contain a lot of ideas in small amounts of text. So every word matters a lot. There's a little light bulbs representing ideas. So I'm gonna look at a couple of poems today in order to describe some parts of a poem. Let's begin with the poem ""Cat"" by Marilyn Singer. It goes like this. I prefer warm fur, a perfect fire to lie beside a cozy lap, where I can nap, an empty chair when she's not there. I want heat on my feet, on my nose, on my hide."
Language,"No cat I remember dislikes December inside. So the person who wrote this poem, Marilyn singer, is the poet for stories. The person who writes the poem is an author, but for poems, the writer is a poet, but who is telling the poem? Who's speaking? The person whose voice we hear in a poem is called the speaker, which is another thing I like about poetry. When you're having trouble understanding a poem, read it aloud. Part of the pleasure of poetry for me is hearing the words bounce around as you say them."
Language,"And then this poem, I'm pretty sure the speaker is a cat. Now you'll notice there are only three sentences in this poem, but they're separated into 15 lines. You can see these lines have anywhere from one to four words in them. Lines can be as long or as short as a poet likes, but here the poet is creating these line breaks to indicate pauses and rhythms, right? Like normally we wouldn't start a new line here, if this were prose, which is what we call all other forms of writing."
Language,"Prose uses normal sentences and paragraphs, right? The poet is choosing to create line breaks in order to change the way the sentence or the line looks on the page. Poetry is not just about how it sounds. Sometimes it's about how it looks as it's written. Now, in addition, the poet is also using spaces to scoot these three phrases over as well as this word inside. The words themselves are scooted in. They're curled up and feeling cozy, like a cat by a fire in the middle of December."
Language,"You'll also notice that some but not all of the lines rhyme with each other. And let's take a moment to think for a second. What is rhyming really? One way to think about it is when the ending sound of a word matches the other ending sound of a word like lap and nap, or when a bunch of sounds match each other throughout a pair of words like remember, and December, I want to be super clear about this part because I was already out of high school before I learned this thing, but poems don't have to rhyme."
Language,"They can, but they definitely don't have to. I have one more poem part to describe to you. And to do it, I wanna use Billy Collins poem ""Litany"" which sounds like a fancy poem at first, but then becomes much more conversational. I'll end by reading the first three stanzas, which are these paragraph looking things. Not all poems are broken into stanzas, but this one is. So those are some parts of the poem. To review, a poet writes lines."
Language,"The place where each line ends is called a line break and a group of lines together in a paragraph is called a stanza. The voice that tells us the poem, the poem's narrator is called the speaker. Some poems rhyme, others don't. Here's a snippet of ""Litany"" by Billy Collins. Litany. You are the bread and the knife, the crystal goblet and the wine. You are the dew on the morning grass and the burning wheel of the sun. You are the white apron of the baker and the marsh birds suddenly in flight."
Language,"However, you are not the wind in the orchard, the plums on the counter, or the house of cards. And you are certainly not the pine scented air. There is just no way that you are the pine-scented air. It is possible that you are the fish under the bridge. Maybe even the pigeon on the General's head, but you are not even close to being the field of corn flowers at dusk. There's more, but I'd love it if you looked it up and read it aloud yourself. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Once we've sussed out whose perspective a story or a poem is being told from, what's next? What else is there to talk about? Well, I think it's useful to remember that stories and poems don't just happen. They don't just suddenly, spontaneously exist. Creating them is work. And it's the result of a whole bunch of decisions made by a writer. So, who is the point-of-view character or characters? What does that mean for the story? Ultimately, a point of view is an author's decision."
Language,"So, when an author chooses to center a story on one character, how does that change the story they tell? Would the story be different if it were centered on a different character? How does that point of view impact the way the story gets told? Imagine a rocket scientist with a mouse in her pocket, and they're going to inspect a spaceship under construction."
Language,"I'm gonna give you two little snippets in what's called close third person perspective, where there's a narrator, but their point of view is attached to a character. We get to see through their eyes, experience their thoughts. So, first, we're gonna hear from the rocket scientist. ""Leaving the lab, Dr. Harper strode confidently ""into the spaceship hangar, ""clipboard in hand, pet mouse in pocket."
Language,"""Launch day was only eight months away, ""and Project Juno still had so many bugs to work out, ""but she was certain that the test she'd conduct today ""would help her solve the air filter problem. ""The starship sat before her in a pool of light, ""a deep bluish-black craft, ""once an idea that had lived only in her mind, ""but now it was a real physical object. ""She dug around in her pocket ""and fed Persephone a sunflower seed."" Now, let's take that again from the mouse's perspective. ""Persephone T."
Language,"Mouse ""clung to the lip of Tatiana's jacket pocket, ""as they passed from a small cold room ""into a much larger, warmer, and brighter room. ""It had been four hours since she'd had anything to eat, ""and she was cranky. ""In the middle of the big, bright room ""was a big bluish black shape. ""Persophone didn't know what it was, ""and frankly, it looked kind of like a bird, ""which was weird and a little frightening."
Language,"""But it hadn't moved ""the last time Persephone and Tatiana were in there, ""and it wasn't moving now. ""So, Persephone guessed it was asleep. ""She chirped impatiently, ""and Tatiana gave her a sunflower seed."" You see, the same things happen in each story. Dr. Harper goes from her lab to the spaceship hangar, and then, she feeds her pet mouse a sunflower seed. But when we hang out with Harper's perspective, we get her thoughts and we see what she thinks is important."
Language,"But when we're reading from Persephone the mouse's perspective, she doesn't care about the spaceship, she doesn't know what it is. As readers, it's useful to ask how a writer is developing a character's point of view through a story. What are the abilities and limitations of a point-of-view character? Persephone the mouse is small. She can sneak through little holes in the wall or hide in the jacket pocket of a consenting human being. But Dr."
Language,"Harper has, you know, an astrophysics doctorate and opposable thumbs. She can open doors, design a spaceship, plan its flight trajectory. This is kind of an extreme example because one of these characters is a human being and the other one is a mouse. But even among different people, we can imagine very different stories. Characters and stories are just like real people. They have strengths and weaknesses, knowledge about some things and ignorance about others."
Language,"Sometimes, they tell the truth, and sometimes, they lie. This is especially important in first-person books, where everything we read comes to us directly from the point-of-view character. You have to open yourself up to the possibility that the narrator can be wrong about stuff. They can perceive things incorrectly, or be blinded by their own assumptions, or just be confused. They could also just be lying. But they could also just be innocently wrong and confused."
Language,They could look at a spaceship and think it's a bird. Narrators that are wrong or misinformed or actively trying to trick you are called unreliable narrators. Reading a book narrated by an unreliable narrator turns the relatively straightforward process of reading into a tug of war.
Language,"How do I know I can trust what the narrator is telling me? Ask yourself, what does a narrator think? What do they feel and what do they do? When you can answer all of those questions, you can begin to put their perspective into words. If you can identify the biases or the perspective or the ignorance of a point-of-view character, you can start to correct for it as you read, and use that understanding of the point of view to better understand the story as a whole."
Language,"Something important to remember is that the storytelling character is not the same thing as the author. The author creates those characters and is literally the person who writes the words. But if I wrote a story about an ogre who eats children, that does not make me an ogre who eats children. I would never eat children. They taste horrible. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"You'll notice it has almost no words in it, at least in this form. Now, let me show you the script. Pages three and four, panel one. A double-page spread, the whole greenhouse revealed, in widescreen. It's glorious. Wisps of steam curl up from bubbling patches of pool, green kelpy tendrils twine up the sides of the building. Everything is suffused with a delicate, green glow. Absent the gro-lights, some of the algae fluoresce in a range of cool-spectrum colors. But primarily greens."
Language,"Eugene is dwarfed by its almost cosmic magnificence. Caption, I can't describe it. None of that language, except for the caption, shows up in the final layout. All of that was me, the writer, giving art direction to Cour, the illustrator. Then they translated that language into their own version. I think it's a pretty faithful translation. My words are translated through Cour's design sensibilities and turned into artwork."
Language,"When you translate a written work into a different medium, whether it's illustrated, animated, recorded, or performed live it changes. It becomes a fundamentally different object. As readers, it's a valuable skill to explore how a text changes as it shifts from one medium to another. And when I say, medium, I mean a style of work, like a stage play, a film, a graphic novel, and audio drama, any of that. Good readers analyze those changes and use them to understand decisions that creators make."
Language,"If you're watching Romeo and Juliet and the director has made the decision to dress everyone in towering robot suits, a detail that is definitely not in the play as written, what does that decision tell you? What does it mean to you? Maybe you have had the experience of reading a book series that was important to you and then they made it into a movie and you were so excited to see the movie, and you sat down to see it and it was awful."
Language,"Like, they cast the wrong actors and they simplified the plot until it made no sense, and it just didn't feel right. That feeling is an example of this tension, this change, between a written material and its visual adaptation. Sometimes it can be bad, sometimes it can be good. Some readers can imagine what characters in books look or sound like, hearing them in their mind's ear, seeing them in their mind's eye."
Language,"The way your imagination renders a character is going to be different from how someone else's imagination does it. So let's compare the script for this audio drama we've got on Khan Academy, Hands Off My Phone, and let's compare that against the recorded version. So first, I'm going to put up the script and I'd like you to pause the video and just read it to yourself very quickly. And now let's take a listen to the recorded version. (upbeat music) (bell ringing) - [Sebastian] Oh no he didn't."
Language,"That is so harsh. - [Valentina] Right? - [Sebastian] Your dad took your phone away, just for getting a D on the history test? - [Valentina] Yep. - [Sebastian] My mind is blown. - [Valentina] Mine too. - [Sebastian] I mean, that was an easy test. - [Valentina] What? - [Sebastian] I can't believe you got a D. - [Valentina] Hey! That's not really-- - [Sebastian] And your dad is the school principal, and he took your phone away. Whoa. (chuckling) - [Valentina] You know, this isn't really helping."
Language,"- [Sebastian] Your life is so bleak right now. -    So you can read that script and think, oh hey, Sebastian is being earnestly sympathetic. Like, he really recognizes that his friend is hurting, but when you hear that performance the way I interpreted this line is that Sebastian is low-key roasting Valentina. He's not saying your life is so bleak in a kind way. He's rubbing salt into the wounds and being a dingus about it."
Language,"There's also other stuff that's not explicitly in the script like, that opening musical sting. (upbeat music) And the ringing of the bell. (bell ringing) Or those background school noises. All of that is meant to represent the fact that you're listening to a fictional show that takes place in a school setting. Does it work? That's for you to decide. When you watch or listen to a performance or a recording, or when you look at illustrations, ask yourself some questions."
Language,"For an audio piece, how do the sound effects, the acting decisions, and the music impact the story or affect the meaning of the words the characters say? How does the way an actor delivers a line change its emphasis? Was someone being sarcastic or sincere in a way you didn't expect, for example? For an illustrated story, how do those illustrations help you understand the author's tone and do you agree with those choices? Is the author's interpretation of the story the same as yours? For a TV show, or a movie, or a play, in addition to all the decisions made by actors about how to use their voices, shape their faces, or hold their bodies, how does the set tell the story? How do costumes tell the story? How does lighting or special effects impact the tone? For TV and film, how does the camera impact the way the story is told? The way a piece of film text is edited, its cuts, its angles, its rhythms, can help shape the way you, as a viewer, as a reader of visual text, understand it."
Language,"And if you can learn that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"(tense big band music) Friday was a very straightforward, almost relentless, character and the catchphrase associated with his character was ""Just the facts."" ""All we want are the facts, ma'am,"" was the sort of thing that he would say. And that's what we're talking about today: just the facts. There's this idea called objectivity. That you can talk about something without inserting any opinions which are personal thoughts or beliefs."
Language,"Doing this, being objective, is very difficult; opinions want to creep in. So what does it mean for a summary to be objective? It means it isn't influenced by feelings or opinions, it's not written in the first person, it's about the text, not me, and it's not a judgment or a review of the information. Let's be clear here; it's not bad to have opinions. In my opinion, it is good to have opinions, but they do not have a place in summaries. You can put opinions to use when you analyze or evaluate something."
Language,"When you're looking at summaries and you're trying to determine whether one is objective or not, look for words that cast judgment. Does the writer say something is good or terrible or useful or useless? Let's do this together. I'll take this text and summarize it without any opinions. Polar bears hunt for seals on thick sea ice in the Arctic. As the Earth grows warmer, though, sea ice gets thinner."
Language,"With less stable ground, some hungry polar bears search for food inland, often dangerously close to human environments. Although polar bears usually keep to themselves, a very scared or angry one could attack, and even eat, a human. Several villages have set up polar bear patrols as a result. The patrollers zoom around on snowmobiles, using bright lights and loud noises to scare away polar bears. Hopefully, the polar bears find another snack later on."
Language,"Here's my summary: Climate change causes polar bears to encroach on human habitats to search for food. As a consequence, these villages have set up polar bear patrols to frighten them away. As a person who cares about climate change, as well as the wellbeing of bears and human beings, I have all sorts of opinions about this, but for the purposes of summarizing that paragraph, I have to put them aside. Just the facts, ma'am."
Language,"(Dragnet theme) If you get good enough at making objective summaries, you'll start noticing when opinion creeps into things you expect to be objective. And it won't be obvious like bears are terrible and humans are right to scare them away or climate change ravages bear habitats, sending defenseless bears into the jaws of doom: human villages. But it might be in the way a story is framed. Like, there's a difference between bears move into human habitats and bears are forced into human habitats."
Language,"What causes them to move? Forced by whom or by what? Sometimes what's not in a text can be as important as what's in it. Experiment with this a little. Try summarizing some news articles and see if you can restate the facts of the stories without inserting any opinions. It's a fun challenge and it may expose an opinion where you didn't expect to see it. Objectively, you can learn anything. David out. Constant vigilance!."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"And as readers, we use those examples to grab hold of those ideas and better understand them. If I tell you that I have weird hobbies, I need to back up that statement with some examples. I need to illustrate just how weird they are. So if I say my hobbies include going for walks, reading books, and drinking tea, those are very ordinary interests, they're not weird at all. Not a good example. I need to be more selective and better support my claim that my hobbies are strange."
Language,"So instead, I could say my hobbies include puppeteering, making bubble tea from scratch, and learning to read Middle English. Well, now we're getting somewhere, right? Now you're starting to understand just how much of a weirdo this David guy is."
Language,"What is the function of an example? What does it do? When you come across an example, ask yourself, what purpose does this example serve? Why did the author introduce this detail here? How does this example connect to the text overall? Does it form a pattern with other details? And if so, what does that pattern tell me? And finally we ask ourselves, does this example raise other questions? Let's look at a text and evaluate its examples. Here's an excerpt from a piece about the author J.M."
Language,"Barrie, the creator of ""Peter Pan"". ""Barrie didn't have just one version ""of the ""Peter Pan"" story, ""he made changes along the way. ""For example, he learned ""that children were copying Peter Pan ""and trying to jump out of their beds to fly. ""Some of them were getting badly injured! ""So Barrie added the rule that in order to fly, ""you had to have fairy or pixie dust ""blown on you first. ""By adding this rule, ""J.M."
Language,"Barrie was trying to help children understand ""that flying is magical, ""so that they wouldn't try to do it themselves and get hurt."" So the author is saying that J.M. Barrie changed ""Peter Pan"" and then he gives an example of the change. Let's zero in on that example and ask those questions that we just went over. So for this example, what is its purpose? Well, it does a couple of things. It shows us that J.M. Barrie was willing to make changes to his story after it was initially published."
Language,"It shows us that the author wants to portray Barrie as a responsible person. He heard about children injuring themselves by copying his story and so he made an effort to prevent that by changing a detail in the story. It's also a pretty specific example that I can picture. I can imagine kids jumping off of tall things and getting hurt, and Barrie feeling worried about that. And because I can picture it, I can better understand it, which helps me better understand the overall text."
Language,"I only excerpted a small portion of this text. So I'm not gonna ask how it connects to the text overall. But this example does raise other questions for me, like what other children's fiction accidentally encourages people to do dangerous stunts at home? Like jumping off your bed? Examples are really powerful! They can shape a reader's impression of a topic. As a writer, employ them tactically to help develop someone's understanding."
Language,"Recognize that when a series of examples comes in sequence, it tells a story, and story is an incredibly powerful tool. Use it responsibly. As a reader, understand the power that examples have and pay attention to how they're being used. A well-chosen example or two can create a false narrative. As readers, we are engaged in a push and pull with writers, especially when they are trying to convince us of something. Make a writer work to convince you. Read with a skeptical attitude."
Language,"And if you can do that, you can learn anything. David, out.."
Language,"We look at text features to get a better understanding of what the text is all about. Although they're not words. Like I said, text features help our reading comprehension. So what's a good example of a text feature? Well, let's start with, ah, say, a map. Maps are a great example of a feature of the text that isn't made up of words. So this is a social studies textbook. This section is about Egypt. I've turned to this page where there is a map. What is this map of? Well, we can look at this part here."
Language,"This text here over on the side is a caption. It's something that can tell us about an image. And the map is labeled. So it's about the Nile River and how the Nile River is fed from rainfall to the south, the water travels to the north. Here's Egypt up here. Don't focus too much on the details of this being about the Nile and stuff."
Language,"Really, what we're talking about is here is an image, there is a caption next to the image, reading the caption helps us understand what's in the image, and looking at the image helps us understand what's in the caption. So we've got maps, we've got images. And that can be illustrations, photos, blueprints, anything really. And if we go back to our social studies textbook, we can see here there's this image. And just looking at the image on its own, we might not be able to tell what that is exactly."
Language,"But again, there is another helpful little caption over to the side that says this is an aerial view of the Nile. So now we know what this is. And that can help ground us as we go through the rest of the text, which is also, I assume, about the Nile River an ancient Egypt. The caption and its picture are two halves of a whole. They're both helping you understand the other. Other useful text features include charts, diagrams, and graphs, which can include things like timelines. This page here has a table."
Language,"You can see up at the top, this top row is labeled Ancient Egypt. And then on the left, we have all the different periods of Egyptian history. And on the right, all the dates associated with those periods. There's also a timeline in this lesson. And this one has a bunch of different text elements, right? So we have, it's not a traditional-looking timeline, but you can see that it's arranged from top to bottom, oldest to most recent."
Language,"Those are just some of the many options that are available to you when you look at a text. Remember that when you're reading a passage, it's not just the words, it's everything on the page. Sometimes I even like to familiarize myself with the charts or the diagrams or the images on the page before I start reading, before I really get down to the business of reading the paragraphs. Because that helps me get rooted. It helps me anchor myself in what the text is gonna be about."
Language,"I look at the pictures, I skim the captions just to say, ""Okay, what's goin' on here? ""Cool, we're talkin' about rivers. ""We're talkin' about ancient Egypt. ""I'm ready."" And building those skills of readiness and being able to anchor yourself in any text that you encounter is what's gonna make you a strong reader. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"How's this thing gonna stay upright? How do we make sure it doesn't blow over in the wind or collapse in an earthquake? And so they say, okay, maybe we'll put reinforcing steel in the concrete or put X-braces on the outside or big ol' pylons in the center. Well, writers do pretty much the same thing. When an author creates an informational text, they ask themselves the same question."
Language,"How's this thing going to stay upright? How shall I structure this text? Because although it's not physical in the way that a building is physical, texts have structure. You can't touch them, but you can see them. Now, there are many ways to structure a piece of writing. But today, I wanna talk about five, chronology, compare and contrast, cause and effect, problem and solution, and description. Let's talk about each one in turn, using the medium of one of my favorite foods, pizza."
Language,"I recognize that's a really weird-looking pizza. But you can learn anything. I'm going to get better at it before this video is over. So chronology. Chronology is events described in order. Chronos is Greek for time. So anything that has that distinctive C-H-R-O-N root is going to be about time. Chronicle, chronometer, chronically. You can suss out if a text is using a chronological structure if it's a sequence in a particular order, or if it's telling a story from history."
Language,"Recipes are also chronological, right? In order to bake the cake properly, you have to turn the oven on first. And to that end, you can generally identify this text structure by looking for time words like first or last or finally. So a chronological account could be the history of the origins of modern day pizza in 19th century Naples or a step-by-step recipe for making pizza dough. Here's an example of the chronology of ordering pizza. This is how you order pizza."
Language,"First, look up reviews or ask a neighbor to find the best pizza near you. Then call the pizza place and place your order. Be sure to give your address. Next, it's time to wait. When the pizza finally arrives, make sure to tip the delivery person. Compare and contrast, you've probably heard of this one. When a text compares two or more ideas, that's a compare and contrast. The compare step discusses similarities, how things are similar. And then the contrast step discusses how those things are different."
Language,"Look for clue words like same or different, both and neither, in contrast, or on the other hand. Here's an example. When talking about pizza, a long-standing debate is often between deep-dish and thin-crust pizza. One benefit of deep-dish pizza is how efficient it is. Because of its thickness, a 12-inch deep-dish pie can serve six people. One drawback is that it can be quite messy to eat."
Language,"Thin-crust pizza is good because it's less messy than deep-dish, but it's thin, so it takes a larger pizza, or multiple pizzas, to feed the same number of people as a deep-dish pizza can. Cause and effect. This one does what it says on the tin, right? It describes how one idea or event causes another. Here's an example. To celebrate my great report card, my parents let me order pizza with all my favorite toppings. After we ate, we were too stuffed to do anything else."
Language,"Now, what caused us to get pizza? My great report card. What was the effect of the pizza? We were stuffed. Maybe it was a stuffed pizza. If you stuff yourself with stuffed pizza, does that make you more stuffed than if you stuff yourself with unstuffed pizza? You may scoff, but this is the stuff that keeps me up at night. Problem and solution. In this kind of text structure, the author describes a problem and then explains how that problem was solved."
Language,"So imagine you want pizza, but you can't have traditional pizza because you're a celiac. You can't have wheat. Necessity is the mother of invention. Enter the cauliflower crust pizza made from cooked cauliflower, cheese, and a variety of gluten-free flours. All right, so what was the problem? You can't eat wheat and pizza dough is made of wheat. How do you solve that problem? By making pizza crust out of cauliflower, which I promise tastes better than it sounds. Finally, description."
Language,"This is sort of like an encyclopedia entry that explains basic information about a topic. Like an explainer piece about what pizza is. I'm going to read this as though I have never heard of pizza before. (clears throat) Pizza, a round flatbread traditionally served warm, originated in Naples, Italy in the 19th century. This flatbread is generally baked at very high temperatures, topped with flavorful tomato sauce and melted mozzarella cheese and served in slices."
Language,"If you find yourself looking at an informational text and you're struggling to figure out what the structure is, subtract the specifics. If you subtract the specifics, it'll help you think about the structure. And if it helps, you can substitute those specific details about the text with pizza. Is this silly? Yeah, of course. Does it work? I think it does. So is the text structured like a recipe or the history of pizza? If so, it's chronology."
Language,"Is it comparing two kinds of pizza? Well, then it's a compare and contrast. Does it explain how a good report card led to a pizza dinner? It's cause and effect. Does it explain a pizza problem and how it was solved in a pizza way? Well, that's a problem-solution structure. And finally, does it straightforwardly describe what a pizza is without a detailed chronology, comparison, or problem? Because if so, that's a description. Those are only five possible ways to structure a piece of writing."
Language,"They're by no means the only ways. But identifying these will give you the tools to learn even more structures so that you can better understand how writers shape ideas. I hope that this helped. And I also hope that you want pizza now, because I certainly do. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"And sometimes that purpose will be harder to see. As readers, our job is to consider the author's purpose as we read. How is it influencing the information the author shares? How is it influencing my understanding of the topic? Is what I think the same as what the author thinks? Do I agree with them? Do I disagree? You may be familiar with the memory device of P.I.E., persuade, inform, entertain, as three categories of purpose. But I'd like to go deeper than that."
Language,"I live in Washington, D.C., which is home to an entire professional class of what are called lobbyists, people whose job it is to advocate to Congress on behalf of a special interest, for example, the oil industry or the cheese industry. This isn't always bad. You can learn more about lobbyists and advocates in Khan Academy's Government and Politics course. But frequently, it takes the form of someone from an industry trying to convince Congress to give them a competitive advantage over other industries."
Language,"Now, let's pull real-world politics out of this and pretend for the purposes of this lesson that there are two warring lobbying groups in D.C. One that represents the cake industry, and another that represents the pie industry. An age-old conflict. So hold that conflict in your mind for a second, cake versus pie. Now, when we read informational text, we should be learning new information. But the author's opinions can shape the text to the point where the information becomes biased or misleading."
Language,"When you read informational text, maintain an air of healthy skepticism. Ask yourself the following questions constantly. What's the author's opinion? What information did they include, or what information did they leave out? And if so, was that on purpose? What's the connotation of the author's word choice? You know, how do the words feel? And what's the overall tone of the piece? So now we have these questions to ask ourselves, let's return to our pie versus cake lobby fight in Washington."
Language,"So imagine you're reading ""The Washington Post,"" and you see this opinion column. ""Cake Connected to Cavities ""and Poor Dental Health, Study Finds."" ""A recent study by the American Dental Association ""connected the consumption of cake or similar foods ""with a 30% increased risk of tooth decay, ""cavities, and gingivitis. ""People who reported having consumed cake ""in the previous 60 days were significantly more likely ""to experience problems related to dental health ""than those people who did not."
Language,"""Cake is dangerous. ""Cake, which rarely contains fruit, will rot your teeth."" And then if we squint down at the very bottom of the column, it'll say in small text, ""The author is the CEO ""of Circular Solutions, a pie-advocacy network."" And now let's ask ourselves those same questions again while acknowledging that this is a fake story that I made up for the purposes of this video. There is nobody named Wendell Apricotjam, although I wish there were, that'd be a great name."
Language,"So, what's the author's opinion? Well, it seems to me that the author really thinks cake is dangerous and poses a threat to the nation's dental health. We know this because they literally say ""cake is dangerous."" They want people to buy and eat fewer cakes. What information did the author choose to include? Well, so this is interesting."
Language,"The author talks about the results of this study and the big takeaways about the danger of cake or similar foods, and then they go on to mention incidentally that cake rarely contains fruit. That's a curious thing to say. It's almost like they're saying, ""Pie, which has fruit in it, is better for you than cake,"" without actually saying it."
Language,"What information did the author choose to leave out? Well, notice that the piece says ""cake or similar foods."" I would be hard-pressed to come up with a definition of foods similar to cake that does not also include desserts like pie. But the way that this piece is written, it swerves out of its way to avoid pinning the same tooth decay risks on pie the way that it blames cake."
Language,"I think it would be reasonable to assume that if we read the underlying study that this opinion piece is based on, it would include pies and cakes in the same category of sugary desserts that are associated with bad dental outcomes. Why would the author do this? Well, they want you to buy pie instead of cake. But they don't want you to think too hard about it because if you did, you would buy and eat both less cake and less pie. And the pie lobby doesn't want that."
Language,"What's the connotation or the feeling of the author's word choices? Well, they're citing a scientific study by dentists, so they want you to take their warning seriously, and they're using words like risk and danger, rot and problems. They want you to make an association between eating cake and bad tooth health. They want you to associate scientific language with trustworthiness. So I'm gonna put down scientific authority here. What's the overall tone? It's negative."
Language,"The author does not want you to eat cake. They want you to think it's bad, and they've planted a little hint here that fruity foods are better. And what's a fruity food? Can they say pie is safer? No, not without lying outright. Now, I wanna be clear about two things. Sometimes an author's purpose really will just be to inform straightforwardly. Not everything has to be a tug-of-war between you and the author over the truth."
Language,"Sometimes a writer just wants you to know the lifecycle of a butterfly, or how to make egg salad, or the order the U.S. presidents came in. But most of the time, there's a purpose, an opinion, behind the text. Now, the second thing I wanna be super clear about is that I made up this whole thing. I made up the article, the statistics, Wendell, you know, all of that's fake. I like both pie and cake very much."
Language,"And now that I've said that, I'm sure you're wondering, ""Oh, is David in the pocket of big dessert?"" And the answer is no. I'm in the pocket of big free education for everyone everywhere. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"""This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why."" Argument does not sneak, it does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories: data, fact, observable reality. There is a place for pure subjective opinion, and it is the realm of the movie and the restaurant review."
Language,"""I did not like this movie because I didn't laugh at its jokes."" ""I did not enjoy the hamburger I got because I found it too dry for my liking."" This is not what we're talking about today. Obviously, argument is rooted in opinion and subjective personal preferences, but those opinions need to be backed up with evidence. Let's compare arguments for and against a tax on soda."
Language,"Now, this writer argues that sugar contributes to obesity, and therefore, people should be prevented from buying soda, which is full of sugar on the grounds that it is bad for them, let's take a look. The soda tax could alter many people's behavior, causing them to stop buying sugary drinks. Some foods are necessities like milk, eggs, and bread. People will buy them even if the prices increase. Sugary drinks aren't necessary."
Language,"If the price goes up, people will buy fewer sugary drinks and they won't be consuming as much sugar, therefore, the obesity rate will go down. Whereas this author counters that people have a right to make what they see as unhealthy decisions. Soda and other sugary drinks have been targeted because they lack nutrition and are basically just liquid sugar. Most people would agree that proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
Language,"However, do legislators have the right or responsibility to regulate people's sugar intake in order to improve their health? I say, no. All right, let's evaluate these claims. For the first argument in favor of the soda tax, how do we know this is true? What evidence does this author give that this tax will alter people's behavior? What evidence does this author give that sugary drinks aren't seen to be as essential as milk? After all, not everyone can or does drink milk."
Language,"In the piece, the evidence that the author gives us is this table, which shows how much sugar is in soda per serving, but it doesn't use evidence to connect sugar consumption to unhealthy outcomes. All this says is, soda has a lot of sugar. I wanna see evidence, I wanna see studies. How do we know this tax would change behavior? Good readers think through the impacts of an argument."
Language,"If this tax went into effect, what would the consequences be? Are there faults in the author's logic? It might stop some people from buying soda, but in an unfair way. Here's how I'm processing this as a reader. If you take a bottle of soda that previously costs, say $2, and the tax makes it $10, that will make it more difficult to purchase. But to a millionaire, the difference between $2 and $10 is basically nothing. Whereas to a poor or middle class person, that $8 difference adds up pretty quickly."
Language,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary."
Language,"So now I'm asking, whose responsibility is it to determine how much sugar is in a drink? Why is sugar so inexpensive to begin with? Do legislators have a responsibility there? Now we know it's not legal to bottle rat poison and sell it as tea, but whose responsibility is that? What isn't this author saying, and how does not saying it serve their argument? They're not saying what the government could or should do, only what it shouldn't do."
Language,"And this is why I want you to be skeptical whenever you read anyone's argument about anything. You need to figure out what the terms of the debate are. What does the argument assume as a given? What's a problem worth fixing? What are the trade offs that the writer thinks are acceptable? So when you encounter an argument in text, look for the claims, and then look to see if those claims are backed up with data-supported reasoning."
Language,"Is the author using evidence and logic? Do they anticipate objections to their arguments and push back on or incorporate those critiques? Above all else, I want you to remain skeptical. Everyone's selling something, even me. It's just the thing I'm trying to sell you is the fundamental idea that you can learn anything. You've got this, Readers. David out.."
Language,"You should be skeptical of all informational writing until the writer gives you a reason to trust them. Honestly, you should be skeptical of me until I give you a reason to trust me. Who am I, after all? Just some stranger on the internet. Well, that's a little unfair, actually. You probably knew about Khan Academy well before you watched this video, which means you have a sense that the information we teach is reputable or trustworthy."
Language,"So, maybe I'm already at an advantage for you trustworthinesswise, because you associate me with an institution you already have good feelings about. When an author writes for informational purposes, they want you to believe that they're telling the truth, but you can't just accept that on faith. No human being is so important that they can't be bothered to explain themselves. Now, let's be clear, that doesn't mean that everyone you disagree with personally owes you an explanation."
Language,"It just means that you don't have to swallow their arguments hook, line, and sinker. So, how do we move forward? We can't just go around in a nightmarish swirl of misinformation, never knowing whom to trust. That's no good. Society couldn't function. Imagine looking at the weather report and saying, ""I don't believe you!"" And then, walking outside your home in shorts when the forecast calls for snow. That would be terrible, for you."
Language,"The key is to ask yourself, ""Why should you trust the weather forecast?"" forecasters are scientists, specifically meteorologists. Their job is to study weather patterns and make predictions. And that doesn't mean they always get it right, because they're making what amounts to educated guesses about the weather. But their expertise and their access to weather monitoring equipment make them likelier to know what the weather's going to do than the average person would."
Language,"And this is basically the test you should bring to all informational writing. Good readers look for clues to establish trustworthiness, to establish that the author knows what they're talking about, that they've done the research, that they're an expert worth listening to. Someone who hops on YouTube and says, ""Here's why your teachers are lying to you ""about the goblins who live in the moon,"" is someone that warrants some skepticism, a little side-eye."
Language,"Also, how awesome would it be if there were moon goblins? And why would anyone want that information to be kept secret? Okay, when you look at a text, you have to wrap your head around three big things. One, the main idea or the claim. What is the author trying to say, explain or convince you of? Two, the evidence for that claim? What are the facts, details, or other pieces of information that tell us that that claim is true or accurate? And three, the reasoning."
Language,"How the evidence prove that the claim is true? Okay, so let's imagine that this conspiracy guy on YouTube is trying to make the case about those goblins. Let's listen in on his argument. - [YouTuber] I firmly believe that there is a colony of goblins living inside the moon and the government is keeping this information from you. How do we know this? Look at the moon! See that little squiggle? You were taught that was just a crater, but it isn't! It's actually the tip of an enormous goblin moon base."
Language,"How do I know that? The goblins told me so. I have a special phone line from my house to the moon goblins. And through me, they can answer any questions you've got. Our moon door is always open, the goblins tell me. -    All right, so, what's the claim? Goblins live inside the moon. What's his proof? What we think is a crater on the moon is actually a goblin moon base. What's his reasoning? What backs that up? He says the goblins told him so."
Language,"Now, is that evidence? Or is that just something he's telling us? Well, one way we can know he's probably full of baloney is that only he can talk to the moon goblins. Right, he says he's got a special phone line. They can answer questions through him. We can't talk to the goblins. We can't have access to any of their information. He's behaving like the information is freely out there for anyone, but it isn't. You have to go through him."
Language,"So, can the stuff he's saying be independently verified? That is to say, can anyone other than this person prove that there are moon goblins or that that crater is a moon base? Are there photos or video from those goblins? And if not, why not? This doesn't pass the smell test for me. There's proof, but only I get to see it, is not proof. That's just made up. When it comes to making arguments, you have to show your work. A good writer has to earn the trust of their audience."
Language,"And a good reader has to make a writer work for that trust. ""What does that look like?"" I hear you asking. Excellent question. Let's take a look at a piece that does its homework. Okay, let's read. ""There are some conspiracy theorists ""that claim that NASA's moon landing missions ""in the late 60s and 70s never happened, ""despite the mountain of evidence to the contrary."
Language,"""They claim that the photographs were faked, ""the mission recordings were scripted, ""and the moon rocks were nothing more ""than ordinary earth rocks. ""Perhaps you are among these conspiracists. ""If so, let me prove to you ""that the moon landings took place. ""Perhaps you are skeptical of the US government, ""which was in the middle of the Cold War ""with the Soviet Union and a shooting war in Vietnam. ""Perhaps you believe that any information from NASA ""is therefore suspicious."
Language,"""Fortunately for you, ""there is plenty of third-party evidence ""that Americans traveled to and landed on the moon. ""An observatory in the UK that previously observed ""the Russian launch of the Sputnik probe ""used its radio telescope ""to observe the 1969 moon landing. ""The Bochum Observatory, this one in Germany, ""also confirms that mission."
Language,"""Finally, present-day photos ""from many different space agencies around the world ""have confirmed the presence of footprints, rover tracks, ""and the lunar rovers themselves. ""In order for a moon landing to have been faked, ""the rocket scientist James Michael Longuski ""estimates that more than 400,000 people ""who worked on the projects in some capacity ""would have had to keep the conspiracy a secret."
Language,"""In his 2006 book 'The Seven Secrets of How to Think Like a Rocket Scientist,' ""Longuski suggests that given how complicated it would be ""to fake such a project, ""it might actually be easier to just go ahead ""and do the moon landing in the first place."" So, if you don't believe the US government, this writer is saying, let's look at some other sources. How do we know those sources are real? Well, we have some names to look into to independently verify it. We've got this rocket scientist."
Language,"We have the name of this German observatory. We could look into and verify these statements. It's not just one guy asserting that there's goblins on the moon. It's someone saying here are some non-NASA sources that can confirm that Americans landed on the moon. Be careful out there. It's a wild world of people who wanna bend your brains and turn you against your neighbors. Use your brain, your heart, and your reading skills to fend them off, as you develop your principles. You've got this, readers."
Language,You can learn anything. David out..
Language,"I legitimately wrote a book about this a few years ago, and to research this book about the world's deadliest animals, I read a lot of other books and sources. So I wanna use this experience to show you why it's important to read more than one source on a subject. Okay, so why do it? Why not say all right, I read one text about the Pacific Blue-ringed octopus. Why do I need to read two or three or 20? There are a couple reasons. Let's start with the first, expert knowledge."
Language,"If you wanna know all about octopuses, you can't just look at a single piece of writing say, ""Bam, got it, know all I need to know ""I am the knower of octopus facts."" No, you can't do it. If you want to become an expert, you need to be able to say well, this book says the Pacific octopus toxin can stop your heart. But this one says that you can tell whether or not an octopus is frightened by its color. Reason number two to read multiple sources, helping to determine or know what's true."
Language,"Sometimes people get things wrong. It helps to read more than one text to make sure you're getting as many perspectives or ideas as you can. Sometimes information from an old book might be outdated or information from a new book hasn't yet been proven to be true. Reading different texts can help you decide what you think about a topic, or even whether or not something is true."
Language,"We can answer questions like, what is the deadliest animal? Or how do we even define deadliest? Reason number three, to read multiple texts on the same topic, supporting an argument. The more information you can get about a topic, the more support you can give to your own opinions or arguments. I think that this animal is the most dangerous because I've read a bunch of different works about dangerous animals and I can support it with evidence, you would say."
Language,"If I were to say that bears are more dangerous than I don't really know what I drew, I thought I was trying to draw a sheep but I think it's a hedgehog. If I were to try to argue that bears are more dangerous than hedgehogs, I would use multiple sources to provide evidence for those claims. Bears are taller, bears are heavier, bears have sharper teeth, bears are stronger. Hedgehogs or sheep are cuter and cuddlier sorry to bears."
Language,"It's important to recognize that different books have different arguments in them. Every book has a different angle, right? Sometimes it's obvious like a book with the title, ""Deadly animals and how to hunt them"" versus a book called ""Deadly animals and how to protect their habitats."" People have opinions and people make books. So, that means that books can have opinions too."
Language,"Are these animals cool or terrifying? Should they be hunted or protected? Reading one text on a subject doesn't give you the full story. It's important to be able to read more than one text, compare them and then decide what you think from that. It helps to have a purpose in mind too as you read. Oh, and to answer your unspoken question, the deadliest animals on earth are definitely human beings but in a close second place is hippos. Those guys will bite you in half. So you know, watch out for hippos."
Language,You can learn anything. David out..
Language,"At the time of this recording, I'm 31 and I run into new and confusing words every day. I read a lot and it's always a fun challenge to run into words like, I don't know, glabrous or limned or nacreous. I know a lot about language and even I have trouble figuring out what those words mean on their own. So it's important to rely on context, the language that surrounds the word. Let's say you're reading a text and you come across a sentence that has a word in it you don't recognize."
Language,"Here's a bit from a passage about the famous chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. ""Jane Goodall arrived at Tanzania's ""Gombee Stream National Park in 1960. ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers. ""After all, she had not yet been to college."" So let's pause on unconventional. What does that word mean? Well, let me give you some ideas, that's the memory aid I use to keep it straight."
Language,"IDEAS, it stands for inference, definition, example, antonym, synonym, I-D-E-A-S, IDEAS, which are all different kinds of context clues. Every word will have a different context, so you might need to vary your approach. The way this snippet is written let's try inference first, then I'll rewrite the sentence a few times to show you the other methods. Okay, the I in IDEAS, inference. We can draw conclusions from the context."
Language,"If we don't know what unconventional means, we can take a look at the rest of the sentence or other nearby sentences to figure it out. Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal."
Language,"And because I'm making an inference about this word's meaning I wanna keep an eye out for it in other places to see if I can confirm or revise that working definition later. D - definition. Context clues like these will just give you the definition of the word in question. So a good example of that would be: ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers."
Language,"""She hadn't been to college yet, ""and this made her different and unexpected."" Different and unexpected is a great definition for the word unconventional. This style of context clue occurs when the author expects a word to be unfamiliar to you and builds in a guide for you right there in the text. The E in IDEAS stands for example, and this is somewhere between inference and definition. If the author describes Goodall as unconventional, they'll go on to talk about something unconventional that Goodall did."
Language,"""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among animal researchers. ""For one thing, she hadn't been to college yet."" So this is very similar to that initial sentence, except for the transition phrase for one thing, which is a way to set up examples. Antonym - an antonym is a word whose meaning is the opposite of another word, like how night is the opposite of day, or how love is the opposite of hate."
Language,"So if there's an example in the text of what Jane Goodall was not, we can use that to figure out what she was. So let's say the passage said: ""Goodall was unconventional. ""She didn't conform, and she wasn't ordinary."" There we have two antonyms and our answer. Similarly, synonym just means write another word with the same meaning similar to a definition. ""Jane Goodall was unconventional. ""She was a nonconformist."
Language,"""She went against the grain."" You can see that I had to rewrite the sentences each time to apply to each context clue strategy, which shows me that you won't find all five context clues every time you need to search for a word's meaning. You need to find the approach that makes the most sense in context. See what I did there, ah huh? And failing that, you can always look up an unfamiliar word in a dictionary. I love to do that."
Language,"I think that's great, but I also feel a sense of victory when I correctly figure out what a new word means, when I've put it together from context. And maybe if I'm still curious, I look it up later and then I turn out to be right, and I'm all like ""Victory at sea, I did it!"" Oh, and if you were curious, glabrous means smooth and hairless like a leaf or the skin of a frog. Nacreous means shiny and rainbow colored like the inside of an oyster shell."
Language,"And to limn something means to draw the outline of or to be highlighted in light. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I'm not gonna say that you need to be able to speak modern Greek or read ancient Latin in order to understand English but many complicated words are made up of little language building blocks that we can break apart, using the power of understanding! (explosion) That was cool right? I'm cool? I'm cool. I'm gonna introduce some vocabulary about vocabulary now, so brace yourselves. There's this idea of a root word. Take the word dent, which is Latin for tooth."
Language,"From that root word, we can get the adjective dental, which means about teeth, or the noun dentist, which means a person who specializes in teeth, or the noun dentures, which are false teeth. That's what a root is. Now you can also combine roots to make words. The word phot is Greek for light, the root graph comes from the Greek for writing. You put those together, you get photograph or writing with light. It's kind of poetic, isn't it? To this understanding, let us add the idea of an affix."
Language,"Affixes aren't words or roots but they are word particles that convey meaning. Maybe you've heard of prefixes and suffixes, if you have, these are both types of affixes. Prefixes attach at the front end of a word, whereas suffixes attach at the back end. An example of a suffix would be logy, meaning the study of or the science of."
Language,"So we can make a bunch of words with logy, like biology, that's supposed to be a little amoeba; cetology, the study or science of whales; anthropology, the study of human beings; cosmology, the study of the universe. So if you see a logy, it's going to be some kind of science or specialized area of study. A good example of a prefix would be the Greek para, which means alongside."
Language,"So a paralegal is someone who works alongside lawyers, a paramedic works alongside doctors and if your house is haunted, you don't need a normal pest control expert to get rid of the ghost, you need a paranormal pest control expert, one that is alongside but not within normalcy and thus, you call the Ghostbusters. So what does all of this mean for you as a reader? Well when I encounter a word I don't understand, it's like I had been walking down a hallway and was suddenly confronted with a locked door."
Language,"It's frustrating but the magic, the power of studying roots, prefixes and suffixes is that when you master a small handful of them, you suddenly become the proud owner of a ring of keys. Doors fling themselves open for you, you can go anywhere, you can understand any concept, any piece of vocabulary. An army of locked doors fall off their hinges all at once when you approach. Don't believe me? I'll show you. While excavating the foundation for a geothermal plant, my companion Neha found a fossil."
Language,"Upon closer inspection, she realized it was a pterodactyl. Wow, lot of big words in that little paragraph. Now, watch this. Excavating, so hollowing out. Foundation, bottom-making. Geothermal, Earth heat. Companion, so this is someone you would eat bread with, so bread together, who do we eat bread together with? Our friends. Inspection, looking in or closer and pterodactyl, pter means wing, dactyl means finger, it is a prehistoric winged reptile."
Language,"So while she was digging in the ground to prepare the bottom of a plant that gets electricity from the heat of the Earth, my friend Neha found a fossil. When she looked at it closely, she realized it was a flying reptile with fingery wings. Do you see what I mean about keys? Studying roots and affixes gives me the power to look at those words and crack them apart. You're not so big now, vocabulary word. You have no power over me! Studying roots, prefixes and suffixes will give you that same power."
Language,"I promise you it is awesome, like, literally it fills me with a sense of awe. The power is yours for the taking. You can learn anything, David out. Okay are we doing those fun history reasons though? Okay, the short version is that first the Romans then some Vikings, then some French Vikings invaded the island of Great Britain a bunch of times over the last 1500 years, shaping the language and making what I like to call French-shaped dents in the Germanic structure of English."
Language,"English is a Germanic language, French is a Romance language, meaning not that it is full of love but that it is an offshoot of Latin or you know, Roman. French took root in 11th Century English and merged with it, grafting an enormous amount of Greek and Latin vocabulary on to a German root stock. We often reach for Latin and Greek compounds when we compose new words, which is why we say television in English, which comes from the Greek tele, meaning far away, and the Latin vire, meaning to see."
Language,"If we reached for Germanic roots to make new words, we'd call a television a farseer because indeed, that's what the word is in German, fernsehen. So why do we have Greek and Latin in our vocabulary? Because England was colonized by French speakers almost a thousand years ago. Imagine what English will sound like in another thousand years. Anyway, thanks for coming on this tangent with me. David out for real this time, bye.."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word. This is distinct from denotation, which is more like the dictionary definition of a word. Companion and buddy both have similar denotations. They both mean friend, but companion is a much more formal sounding word than buddy. Which originated as a piece of slang from the 19th century."
Language,"So even though their denotation or their literal definition is the same, they feel different. The connotation of companion is formal while the connotation of buddy is friendly and casual. Good readers pay close attention to the words the author chose to use. They picked those words for a reason. How do those words make you feel? What is the author trying to imply? How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"using details from a text to make inferences, aren't you? - [Sherlock Bones] Yes, my boy! It's simplicity itself. But first, let me deduce a few things about you, shall I? -    Well, Mr. Bones, we're trying to do this about writing, not about people, so... - [Bones] Give me your hand. -    Waugh! - [Bones] Ah, you like to cook, you have a nervous disposition and you work for Khan Academy."
Language,"-    Now how did you know that? - [Bones] You have a callus on your finger from how you hold a knife, your fingernails are bitten, not clipped and your messenger bag says Khan Academy. -    Well and I told you who I was before I showed up. - [Bones] That too. -    But what does this have to do with reading a book? - [Bones] I correctly deduced several truths about your person based on clues, my good David. Indeed, all inference is making sense of clues."
Language,"When you read a story, you are constantly making inferences. -    I see. Okay, I'll read a passage and then see what I can make of it. An hour later, thick smoke poured up the stairs. The smoke detector screamed and I could hear Uncle Paleo stumbling around with the fire extinguisher. When he came upstairs afterward, his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. He was a wreck, broken glasses, black smudges on his face and singed hair."
Language,"Okay, so I can surmise that there was some kind of fire or explosion downstairs, where the character Uncle Paleo was. - [Bones] Hm, how do you know? -    Well his hair was singed, that's another word for burned and his face was covered in black smudges like you get from soot from a fire and there was all the smoke and the smoke detector went off. - [Bones] And there is also the matter of the fire extinguisher. -    Also that. - [Bones] I see something else in that passage too."
Language,"-    What's that, Mr. Bones? - [Bones] Uncle Paleo was exhausted by putting out the fire. -    How can you tell? Where does it say that? - [Bones] Well, it doesn't. That's inference, my lad. Note here how it said his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. Why might that be? -    He stepped in something sticky. No, oo, he's wearing shoes made of lead. - [Bones] Well, those are indeed possible explanations but you want to think of the most likely option."
Language,"-    He was running around to put the fire out and it made him tired. - [Bones] So, you were reading between the lines, were you? Drawing conclusions from the text? -    I was. So we know for sure Uncle Paleo was tired, right? - [Bones] WE DO NOT, SIR. -    Oh!! - [Bones] An inference is only one possible conclusion but is not the only conclusion. -    So what are we to do? - [Bones] The more clues you discover, the stronger your inferences will become."
Language,"You have to look at what you already know about a character, about the setting of the story, the events of a story's plot and piece it together from there. You know that fires create lots of black dust or soot so it strengthens your argument in favor of a fire. And it's background knowledge like that, about the way the world works that will serve you as a reader and as a maker of inferences. Apply what you know to the world of the story and make inferences based on that."
Language,"-    And then, I can become the world's greatest consulting detective? - [Bones] You can become like the world's 50th greatest consulting detective, top of the heap's rather full, I'm afraid. -    Well, thank you for your time today, Mr. Bones. Best of luck with your case work. - [Bones] Thank you; I shan't need it. (barks) -    You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Understanding the plot of a story is essential to writing about it. You can't write about a story if you can't express what happened in it. So what I want to do today is talk about creating objective summaries of texts. Summaries that are free of opinion, or non biased. If you're summarizing a book, you wanna get across the events of the story. Objectivity is hard and weird and has a very specific purpose. You use it to build the bones of your analysis."
Language,"Once you've got the structure in place, bring opinions back. Here are the facts and now here's what I think about those facts. Let me be clear, opinions are good. Opinions are where analysis lives. The whole field of literary criticism would be awfully boring if nobody ever held opinions but all that criticism rests on a basis of objectively summarized texts. So let's talk about how to do just that, how to objectively summarize a text. Here's what you need to do."
Language,"Step one, read the thing you want to summarize. You can't do one without the other. Step two, ask yourself, what are the important parts of this story? Not the interesting parts, not the cool parts, but the most essential parts of the story. Remember we're trying to be objective here so it's not about including the parts you especially liked. So who are the main characters, where does the story take place, what happens in the plot? Step three, pare it down."
Language,"Look at all those important parts you listed, and cut out everything that isn't absolutely essential. Major characters only, setting, conflict, climax, resolution. Step four, put it in order. Write it all out as sentences in the order the plot happened in. The idea is to be able to summarize a whole story in a handful of sentences, like a single five sentence paragraph. And you're gonna wanna paraphrase here."
Language,"Whatever you need to say, say it in your own words so you can get it across as quickly as possible. Ordinarily, I'd say quoting from the text is an important skill but this is one time you won't use it. All right so, those are the four steps. To demonstrate, I'm gonna take a fiction piece from a Khan Academy exercise and I'll go through that process with you. Step one, let's read it all, read this little story chunk. ""'Wilky!' Captain Martello bellowed below deck."
Language,"""'We need your help!' I climbed the ladder quickly ""and was astonished that I hadn't awakened on my own. ""Usually I could sense a storm brewing ""hours before it arrived. ""Captain Martello noticed my look of surprise. ""'She's coming on quick, this one. Here, grab the rope, ""Help me pull down the sail.' ""Overboard, the waters had changed. ""No longer were they an inviting green hue, ""they were dark, foreboding."
Language,"""The moon above tried to peek through the angry sky ""but the clouds kept hijacking her hopeful glow. ""Suddenly, a giant slow rolling wave ""forced my side of the vessel to dip into the water. ""I tried to hang on but the lurching wave was tugging at me. ""Captain Martello grabbed my leg ""and managed to yank me onto Adelina's salt sprayed deck. ""'You're safe,' he said firmly, 'for now.'"" Okay step two, what are the important parts of the story? Okay so Wilky comes on deck when Captain Martello asks him to."
Language,"They're on a boat. And note here that I'm just sort of scribbling down notes, these aren't even sentences. There's a storm coming that Wilky didn't predict. The captain tells Wilky to help him strike the sail. The water is a scary color, a wave nearly washes Wilky overboard but the captain saves him. Oh and the ship is called the Adelina. I think that's a neat name for a ship. All right step three, pare it down. So the fact that I think that Adelina is a neat name for a ship is opinion and not relevant."
Language,"It's also not super relevant that Wilky didn't predict the storm. Or that the water is a spooky color. So do we have all the important details in here? The name of the ship, check. The name of Wilky and Captain Martello, the fact that there is a storm. So part of this is relevant but not the prediction part and Wilky nearly being tossed overboard but saved by the captain. So step four, let's take all of that, put it in order. Start afresh, full sentences, okay."
Language,"Captain Martello calls Wilky up to the deck of the Adelina to help him prepare the ship for a sudden storm. Wilky is nearly washed overboard by a big wave but Martello saves them. That's our strategy, you see? Boil down the story to its essentials, strip away unnecessary detail and rephrase events in your own words in the order that they happened in. Once you've got that squared away, you're ready to back up that great big dump truck full of opinions. All right bring her in."
Language,"(truck backing up beeping) Let them have it, fellows. (crashing) You love to see it. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Once we've sussed out whose perspective a story or a poem is being told from, what's next? What else is there to talk about? Well, I think it's useful to remember that stories and poems don't just happen. They don't just suddenly, spontaneously exist. Creating them is work. And it's the result of a whole bunch of decisions made by a writer. So, who is the point-of-view character or characters? What does that mean for the story? Ultimately, a point of view is an author's decision."
Language,"So, when an author chooses to center a story on one character, how does that change the story they tell? Would the story be different if it were centered on a different character? How does that point of view impact the way the story gets told? Imagine a rocket scientist with a mouse in her pocket, and they're going to inspect a spaceship under construction."
Language,"I'm gonna give you two little snippets in what's called close third person perspective, where there's a narrator, but their point of view is attached to a character. We get to see through their eyes, experience their thoughts. So, first, we're gonna hear from the rocket scientist. ""Leaving the lab, Dr. Harper strode confidently ""into the spaceship hangar, ""clipboard in hand, pet mouse in pocket."
Language,"""Launch day was only eight months away, ""and Project Juno still had so many bugs to work out, ""but she was certain that the test she'd conduct today ""would help her solve the air filter problem. ""The starship sat before her in a pool of light, ""a deep bluish-black craft, ""once an idea that had lived only in her mind, ""but now it was a real physical object. ""She dug around in her pocket ""and fed Persephone a sunflower seed."" Now, let's take that again from the mouse's perspective. ""Persephone T."
Language,"Mouse ""clung to the lip of Tatiana's jacket pocket, ""as they passed from a small cold room ""into a much larger, warmer, and brighter room. ""It had been four hours since she'd had anything to eat, ""and she was cranky. ""In the middle of the big, bright room ""was a big bluish black shape. ""Persophone didn't know what it was, ""and frankly, it looked kind of like a bird, ""which was weird and a little frightening."
Language,"""But it hadn't moved ""the last time Persephone and Tatiana were in there, ""and it wasn't moving now. ""So, Persephone guessed it was asleep. ""She chirped impatiently, ""and Tatiana gave her a sunflower seed."" You see, the same things happen in each story. Dr. Harper goes from her lab to the spaceship hangar, and then, she feeds her pet mouse a sunflower seed. But when we hang out with Harper's perspective, we get her thoughts and we see what she thinks is important."
Language,"But when we're reading from Persephone the mouse's perspective, she doesn't care about the spaceship, she doesn't know what it is. As readers, it's useful to ask how a writer is developing a character's point of view through a story. What are the abilities and limitations of a point-of-view character? Persephone the mouse is small. She can sneak through little holes in the wall or hide in the jacket pocket of a consenting human being. But Dr."
Language,"Harper has, you know, an astrophysics doctorate and opposable thumbs. She can open doors, design a spaceship, plan its flight trajectory. This is kind of an extreme example because one of these characters is a human being and the other one is a mouse. But even among different people, we can imagine very different stories. Characters and stories are just like real people. They have strengths and weaknesses, knowledge about some things and ignorance about others."
Language,"Sometimes, they tell the truth, and sometimes, they lie. This is especially important in first-person books, where everything we read comes to us directly from the point-of-view character. You have to open yourself up to the possibility that the narrator can be wrong about stuff. They can perceive things incorrectly, or be blinded by their own assumptions, or just be confused. They could also just be lying. But they could also just be innocently wrong and confused."
Language,They could look at a spaceship and think it's a bird. Narrators that are wrong or misinformed or actively trying to trick you are called unreliable narrators. Reading a book narrated by an unreliable narrator turns the relatively straightforward process of reading into a tug of war.
Language,"How do I know I can trust what the narrator is telling me? Ask yourself, what does a narrator think? What do they feel and what do they do? When you can answer all of those questions, you can begin to put their perspective into words. If you can identify the biases or the perspective or the ignorance of a point-of-view character, you can start to correct for it as you read, and use that understanding of the point of view to better understand the story as a whole."
Language,"Something important to remember is that the storytelling character is not the same thing as the author. The author creates those characters and is literally the person who writes the words. But if I wrote a story about an ogre who eats children, that does not make me an ogre who eats children. I would never eat children. They taste horrible. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"How do we know that though? How did J. R. R. Tolkien, as an author, develop that theme in the text? How can we go deeper, beyond that headline of the Ring equals the dangers of absolute power? Good readers can look at a whole text from beginning to end and identify where the author purposefully chose words, included details, or directed action that develops or reveals the overall theme."
Language,"It's not just that characters say, ""Oh, no, the Ring's super-dangerous."" In fact, I believe in ""The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf says, ""No, with that power, ""I should have power too great and terrible. ""And over me, the Ring could gain a power ""still greater and more deadly. ""Do not tempt me!"" The characters say that, they do, but it's also about how they behave around the thing."
Language,"It's how the plot is shaped around this object and how a group of people come together to identify this Ring as a dangerous, magical artifact that needs to be destroyed for the good of the world. It's not just dialogue. It's also descriptions by the author and actions taken by the characters."
Language,"So let's go through some of the ways that an author can develop theme within a story, with the important caveat that you won't always be able to detect a theme in a text until you're already finished reading it for the first time. This, to me, is one of the great pleasures of rereading. You've already worked hard to get an understanding of the text, so now you can go back and pick up all the stuff you might not have noticed the first time."
Language,"So one way to develop theme is through the repeated use of a symbol or an object. The Ring in ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great example because characters are always talking about it. But it could really be anything, a design, an object, an animal. Imagine a story about a child who wants to grow up to be an engineer that develops airplanes. And throughout this story, birds keep showing up, birds on the protagonist's windowsill, her favorite teacher's bird earrings, maybe she has a best friend named Robin."
Language,"And from that, we can see the idea of flight is a theme in this story, and all of these bird-related things go back to this character's desire to take flight. Changes in setting are a fine way to develop themes. How is a location portrayed? How does it match with the way characters feel or behave when they appear in these locations? Imagine a character who desperately wants to be alone. So at a tense portion in the story, she flees to a distant mountaintop."
Language,"When she gets there, what's the weather like? Is it cold, snowy, and forbidding on the mountain? Is it an active volcano, bubbling with lava? Is it clear, peaceful, full of snowdrops and mountain goats? What would an author be trying to say with those decisions? How should we, the reader, feel about that character's solitude? If it's snowy and forbidding, is it a symbol of the character's coldness, of their hardening up? Does the volcano reflect the character's explosive potential? Or does the beauty of the lonely mountaintop mean this was the right decision for the character to take? Dialogue that repeatedly references a similar idea can be a way to develop theme."
Language,"When characters mention something a lot, it's probably because the author is thinking about it and maybe wanted to build it intentionally into the story. Imagine a teenager in Ancient Rome who's preoccupied with honor and his family name and how he's worried he won't live up to the achievements of his ancestors. If that's something that he's insecure about, he might think about it often or talk about the concept of honor or the social standing of his family."
Language,"You can also see this presented as explicit lessons by a sage character, usually older and wise. Think of Moana's grandmother or of Yoda. They'll say something explicit like, ""Go do the thing your heart wants, Moana,"" or, ""Trust that the energy of the universe ""will make you a really good space wizard, Luke."" I'm paraphrasing here. Or think of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" saying, ""There's no place like home."" She says it again and again. The words are so powerful that they're used as a magic spell."
Language,"And words so powerful that they become magic is really just another way to say theme. It doesn't need to be said aloud to be thematic. Some of the most powerful moments in storytelling come from action, not just dialogue. Momentous character decisions, like Maui giving up his powers to save Moana or Harry Potter's climactic battle with Voldemort, are chock-full of themes, self-sacrifice, the power of love, the importance of honesty. Some of these themes can be expressed without speaking a single word."
Language,"And I should be clear. Sometimes you need to finish the story before you can look back on it and understand how parts of it contribute to the theme. You might need to get some distance before you can see how all of the pieces fit together. If something really sticks with me, sometimes I like to go back and reread parts of a book once I've gotten a sense of its theme, to see how the author has threaded theme through the text."
Language,"Now, if you look very closely at the videos I make here at Khan Academy, if you really squint your eyes and listen carefully, you'll notice that all of them share the same theme, which is you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Understanding what characters do is key to your success as a reader. The way characters behave towards themselves, towards others, towards objects, can tell us a lot about them and can give us clues to the larger messages in a story. Character actions are what drive a story forward. Let my co-worker Kim read you a story in which nobody takes any actions. -    Once upon a time, there was a magical kingdom in which nobody ever did anything."
Language,"Nobody baked bread or called their friends on the phone or played video games or soccer or basketball or wrote books or ate yogurt. They didn't even nap. They just sat there. (Kim yawns) It was a very boring kingdom. -    Why, thank you, Kim. Without character action, there is no story. Let's try that again. I'll blow the horn of action and Kim you do that again, but this time let's throw in some character decisions. All right, lights, camera, horn of action."
Language,"(horn blares) -    The magical kingdom of Belchantry was abuzz with activity. Bakers baked, ballers shot hoops, yogurt smiths made yogurt. The young princess Lulabell practiced her swordplay. And on a great tower on the outskirts of town an evil wizard put the finishing touches on a spell that would bring terrible darkness to the land. -    See, now that's a story I wanna hear. Character actions and decisions have to drive the story."
Language,"It's about what characters choose to do, not just about the world around them. There could be a big, scary storm, but that's not character action. It's about how the characters react to the storm that matters, that shapes the story. What do characters do in times of trouble or when their friends need help? That's when you can learn the most about them. Actions speak louder than words, after all."
Language,"What motivates these characters? Why do they act the way they act? What are the values or beliefs that drive them? What are their goals? And what does that tell us about the message of the story? Sometimes characters don't behave in the way that we expect, like villainous characters may seem nice in order to do evil things. If we think about ""The Three Little Pigs."" If the Big Bad Wolf is going door to door and saying, ""Hello, little pig. ""It's me, your new neighbor, the Small Nice Wolf."
Language,"""And I brought you some cookies."" If you're the pig looking out the window, you should open the door, right? Heek no! The wolf is trying to trick you, lock the door. What's interesting about looking at character actions is they can help us see how characters change throughout a story. In the film ""Moana,"" the demi-god character Maui begins as a selfish tricky character, but by the end of the movie he's changed and he cares about Moana and helps her. We can see that because of his actions."
Language,"He begins by stealing Moana's boat and stranding her on an island, and he ends by sacrificing his magic fish hook to help her. Sorry for ""Moana"" spoilers. Characters in stories can be complex, just like real people. The way they behave might surprise you. And if it does, ask yourself, why is this a surprise? Why is this character behaving in this way? Look for evidence throughout a text to help you understand the way characters act."
Language,"If you've insight into their thoughts or feelings, that can be a great place to start. But, for now, I'm going to take action by ending this video. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"So science fiction is a genre, fairy tales are a genre, mysteries are a genre. Each one of these types of stories has certain elements that you gradually come to expect from them. Fantasy stories have magic spells and imaginary creatures. Romance stories have lots of smooching. Mystery stories have a crime and a person who tries to solve it. You can call these tropes, you can call these style elements but certain genres have certain expectations embedded in them."
Language,"The more you read of a genre, the more your expectations are shaped for that genre. When a story begins with the phrase, ""Once upon a time,"" and ends with ""and they lived happily ever after,"" you know you're looking at a fairy tale. We all carry with us a unique collection of impressions and expectations. It's your background knowledge, your schema. If you think of your brain as a closet, then schema is the hooks and clothes hangers inside that closet."
Language,"You can put a new shirt on a clothes hanger, you can hang pants or a skirt on a clothes hanger, but if you wanted to hang up a dress, you might need one of those fabric-covered hangers so it doesn't slip. And if you wanna store shoes in your closet, you might need to get a shoe rack or one of those hanging shoe organizers."
Language,"Just as different clothing items require different, you know, closet infrastructure like hangers or shoe racks, your schema, your background knowledge, informs the sort of literature you know how to read. That's a weird sentiment to express, I think, but it's true. The first time you read a book in a particular genre, you're forming an impression of that genre. And that impression gets refined or revised with every similar book you read after the first."
Language,"Reading widely across many genres of fiction expands your brain closet. But let's be clear here. Not every book is connected with every other book. And when you try to apply something you learned in one story to another story, it may not work. For example, in 20th century detective fiction, there is a recurring theme or trope that dates to the 1930s: the butler did it, which is to say that if there's a murder that takes place at a fancy manor house, there's a good chance that the butler is the murderer."
Language,"But if you go into every mystery set at a fancy manor house assuming that the butler is the guilty party, you'll be wrong a lot. Famously, in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, everyone did it. Every suspect in the mystery is responsible in some way for the murder in the title."
Language,"It's an enormous conspiracy, and Christie plays with the readers' assumptions as we go through the story, knowing that you, as a person who has probably read a mystery before, or who is at least familiar with the form, has an expectation that there are only one or two culprits, only one or two people that did the murder to the guy on the train."
Language,"And look, I apologize for spoilers for a story from 1934, but you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs, you know what I mean? Anyway, it's neat to look at the way that an author can play with the expectations of genre, how an author might anticipate a reader's schema and play with that. Something that blew my mind when I was in school was the idea that Star Wars was a western, or at least takes many of its cues from classic pulp western movies. Let's draw a little Venn diagram."
Language,"All right, so over here, we've got Star Wars and over here we've got the western movie genre. Here are some things that Star Wars has that westerns don't have. Space wizards like the Jedi and Sith, magic like the force, or space ships. Here's some things that western movies have that Star Wars movie's don't, by and large, have. Western movies have horses, they tend to have cowboys, and then tend to take place in settings like the western United States and Mexico."
Language,"But here's our overlap, all right, so both Star Wars and western movies have bar fights, both Star Wars and western movies have bounty hunters, and both the Star Wars films and western films tend to have a lot of desert settings. That could be the desert planet of Tatooine from Star Wars, or Monument Valley in the US state of Texas, or the Mexican state of Durango in western films."
Language,"Mind you, you could also make a separate Venn diagram between Star Wars and samurai movies because Star Wars also borrows liberally from those. This is a great activity for analysis. Take two stories that you love and compare their theme, settings, and characters, and see if there's something you can find in common between them. You may discover connections you didn't expect. As I've mentioned before, good readers read widely."
Language,"They read lots of books and they let what they know about one genre, their schema of the genre, help them anticipate and make connections when they read a new book. The more you read, the more schema you build, the easier and more interesting those connections will become. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Hey, what's up readers? David here. I'm taking advantage of the cold that I have by doing my serious detective voice in order to teach you about inferences. (phone ringing) Hold on, let me get that. Hi, this is David. I'm in the middle of doing a video. Now isn't a great time. - [Man On Phone] Hello, I have information about what an inference is. -    Oh, oh that's great. Cool, follow me over to the next screen."
Language,"What is an inference, please? - [Man On Phone] An inference is a conclusion that you make based on clues given in a piece of writing. It's more than a guess, but it's not just an observation either. -    Great, thank you. Was that all you needed? - [Man On Phone] Yeah, that was my only thing. -    All right, thanks, bye. - [Man On Phone] Goodbye. -    So an inference is a conclusion that you draw from writing."
Language,"It's an idea that you pull from a sentence or a passage that isn't literally printed there. It's the detective work of reading, finding clues that help you make sense of what's being said. I feel like we're kind of getting bogged down in theory land so let's take a look at an example. I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. There's my snow fort. It's a D on the flag to represent me. There's me little hot cocoa, couple marshmallows floating in there, my Khan Academy mug."
Language,"They don't make Khan Academy mugs. I want a Khan Academy mug. Okay, so what conclusions can we draw from these two sentences? I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. Beautiful, brilliant, enormous. Then I came inside and had a big mug of hot chocolate. Same deal, brilliant, beautiful, enormous. What conclusions can I draw about this situation? Well if you're making things out of snow and then you're coming inside and having hot chocolate, it's probably not the height of summer."
Language,"One inference that I can draw from these two sentences together is that it is winter time when this sentence takes place. Where I live, these are not activities that one pursues in the height of summer outside. I'm looking for clues within the text. Snow fort, I'm outside, I came inside and then I had hot chocolate which is not traditionally a beverage that is consumed when it's warm out. Let's take a look at another example."
Language,"This paragraph is part of a longer passage that is about a young ballet dancer named Michaela. Michaela danced so wonderfully that she was awarded a scholarship to attend the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School at the American Ballet Theater. That was only the beginning of her dancing success. When she was 17, Michaela danced with the Dance Theater of Harlem professional company. Later, she joined the Dutch National Junior Company. Today, Michaela is a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet."
Language,"So very quickly without getting bogged down in this passage, what are some conclusions, what are some inferences that we can draw about Michaela? Who is Michaela? What do we know about her? We know that she's a dancer. We know that she's very good at it, right? She danced so wonderfully that she got a scholarship. So I'm gonna say Michaela is very talented and we know that her talent led to success because her getting the scholarship was only the beginning of her dancing success."
Language,"We can see from the passage that she was part of at least three different dance companies, the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Dutch National Junior Company, and as a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet today. So I'm gonna say that Michaela is a very hard worker. Now notice no where in the passage does it say Michaela is a very talented, hard working dancer. Just like in the previous example, it didn't say, it was winter outside so I made a snow fort."
Language,"What the skill of inference is requires you to be a detective and take your magnifying glass to the passage to discover clues. Imagine you're a detective like this dog. He's wearing a little deer stalker cap. Let's call him, let's call him Sherlock Bones, the famous dog detective that I just made up. I feel like Sherlock Holmes is always smoking a pipe so I'm gonna give this dog like a, I don't know a bone or a piece of rawhide or something."
Language,"Imagine that you are a detective or a dog detective if you like and every time you read a text, let's say a book, that you are searching for clues within it. What you're doing when you make an inference is you are taking the information that you already know about the world and the places and people in it and how they behave and what they look like and what they do and you're applying that knowledge to the text."
Language,"When do people build snowmen? When do people build snow forts? When do they drink hot cocoa? In the winter time. An important thing to remember though is that inferring is not guessing. Any time you make an inference, you have to be pulling it directly from the text. That's your jumping off point. It can't just be a wild guess out of no where. It comes from information that you've got there on the page. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go eat my weight in cough drops."
Language,"You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"(tense big band music) Friday was a very straightforward, almost relentless, character and the catchphrase associated with his character was ""Just the facts."" ""All we want are the facts, ma'am,"" was the sort of thing that he would say. And that's what we're talking about today: just the facts. There's this idea called objectivity. That you can talk about something without inserting any opinions which are personal thoughts or beliefs."
Language,"Doing this, being objective, is very difficult; opinions want to creep in. So what does it mean for a summary to be objective? It means it isn't influenced by feelings or opinions, it's not written in the first person, it's about the text, not me, and it's not a judgment or a review of the information. Let's be clear here; it's not bad to have opinions. In my opinion, it is good to have opinions, but they do not have a place in summaries. You can put opinions to use when you analyze or evaluate something."
Language,"When you're looking at summaries and you're trying to determine whether one is objective or not, look for words that cast judgment. Does the writer say something is good or terrible or useful or useless? Let's do this together. I'll take this text and summarize it without any opinions. Polar bears hunt for seals on thick sea ice in the Arctic. As the Earth grows warmer, though, sea ice gets thinner."
Language,"With less stable ground, some hungry polar bears search for food inland, often dangerously close to human environments. Although polar bears usually keep to themselves, a very scared or angry one could attack, and even eat, a human. Several villages have set up polar bear patrols as a result. The patrollers zoom around on snowmobiles, using bright lights and loud noises to scare away polar bears. Hopefully, the polar bears find another snack later on."
Language,"Here's my summary: Climate change causes polar bears to encroach on human habitats to search for food. As a consequence, these villages have set up polar bear patrols to frighten them away. As a person who cares about climate change, as well as the wellbeing of bears and human beings, I have all sorts of opinions about this, but for the purposes of summarizing that paragraph, I have to put them aside. Just the facts, ma'am."
Language,"(Dragnet theme) If you get good enough at making objective summaries, you'll start noticing when opinion creeps into things you expect to be objective. And it won't be obvious like bears are terrible and humans are right to scare them away or climate change ravages bear habitats, sending defenseless bears into the jaws of doom: human villages. But it might be in the way a story is framed. Like, there's a difference between bears move into human habitats and bears are forced into human habitats."
Language,"What causes them to move? Forced by whom or by what? Sometimes what's not in a text can be as important as what's in it. Experiment with this a little. Try summarizing some news articles and see if you can restate the facts of the stories without inserting any opinions. It's a fun challenge and it may expose an opinion where you didn't expect to see it. Objectively, you can learn anything. David out. Constant vigilance!."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"And as readers, we use those examples to grab hold of those ideas and better understand them. If I tell you that I have weird hobbies, I need to back up that statement with some examples. I need to illustrate just how weird they are. So if I say my hobbies include going for walks, reading books, and drinking tea, those are very ordinary interests, they're not weird at all. Not a good example. I need to be more selective and better support my claim that my hobbies are strange."
Language,"So instead, I could say my hobbies include puppeteering, making bubble tea from scratch, and learning to read Middle English. Well, now we're getting somewhere, right? Now you're starting to understand just how much of a weirdo this David guy is."
Language,"What is the function of an example? What does it do? When you come across an example, ask yourself, what purpose does this example serve? Why did the author introduce this detail here? How does this example connect to the text overall? Does it form a pattern with other details? And if so, what does that pattern tell me? And finally we ask ourselves, does this example raise other questions? Let's look at a text and evaluate its examples. Here's an excerpt from a piece about the author J.M."
Language,"Barrie, the creator of ""Peter Pan"". ""Barrie didn't have just one version ""of the ""Peter Pan"" story, ""he made changes along the way. ""For example, he learned ""that children were copying Peter Pan ""and trying to jump out of their beds to fly. ""Some of them were getting badly injured! ""So Barrie added the rule that in order to fly, ""you had to have fairy or pixie dust ""blown on you first. ""By adding this rule, ""J.M."
Language,"Barrie was trying to help children understand ""that flying is magical, ""so that they wouldn't try to do it themselves and get hurt."" So the author is saying that J.M. Barrie changed ""Peter Pan"" and then he gives an example of the change. Let's zero in on that example and ask those questions that we just went over. So for this example, what is its purpose? Well, it does a couple of things. It shows us that J.M. Barrie was willing to make changes to his story after it was initially published."
Language,"It shows us that the author wants to portray Barrie as a responsible person. He heard about children injuring themselves by copying his story and so he made an effort to prevent that by changing a detail in the story. It's also a pretty specific example that I can picture. I can imagine kids jumping off of tall things and getting hurt, and Barrie feeling worried about that. And because I can picture it, I can better understand it, which helps me better understand the overall text."
Language,"I only excerpted a small portion of this text. So I'm not gonna ask how it connects to the text overall. But this example does raise other questions for me, like what other children's fiction accidentally encourages people to do dangerous stunts at home? Like jumping off your bed? Examples are really powerful! They can shape a reader's impression of a topic. As a writer, employ them tactically to help develop someone's understanding."
Language,"Recognize that when a series of examples comes in sequence, it tells a story, and story is an incredibly powerful tool. Use it responsibly. As a reader, understand the power that examples have and pay attention to how they're being used. A well-chosen example or two can create a false narrative. As readers, we are engaged in a push and pull with writers, especially when they are trying to convince us of something. Make a writer work to convince you. Read with a skeptical attitude."
Language,"And if you can do that, you can learn anything. David, out.."
Language,"How's this thing gonna stay upright? How do we make sure it doesn't blow over in the wind or collapse in an earthquake? And so they say, okay, maybe we'll put reinforcing steel in the concrete or put X-braces on the outside or big ol' pylons in the center. Well, writers do pretty much the same thing. When an author creates an informational text, they ask themselves the same question."
Language,"How's this thing going to stay upright? How shall I structure this text? Because although it's not physical in the way that a building is physical, texts have structure. You can't touch them, but you can see them. Now, there are many ways to structure a piece of writing. But today, I wanna talk about five, chronology, compare and contrast, cause and effect, problem and solution, and description. Let's talk about each one in turn, using the medium of one of my favorite foods, pizza."
Language,"I recognize that's a really weird-looking pizza. But you can learn anything. I'm going to get better at it before this video is over. So chronology. Chronology is events described in order. Chronos is Greek for time. So anything that has that distinctive C-H-R-O-N root is going to be about time. Chronicle, chronometer, chronically. You can suss out if a text is using a chronological structure if it's a sequence in a particular order, or if it's telling a story from history."
Language,"Recipes are also chronological, right? In order to bake the cake properly, you have to turn the oven on first. And to that end, you can generally identify this text structure by looking for time words like first or last or finally. So a chronological account could be the history of the origins of modern day pizza in 19th century Naples or a step-by-step recipe for making pizza dough. Here's an example of the chronology of ordering pizza. This is how you order pizza."
Language,"First, look up reviews or ask a neighbor to find the best pizza near you. Then call the pizza place and place your order. Be sure to give your address. Next, it's time to wait. When the pizza finally arrives, make sure to tip the delivery person. Compare and contrast, you've probably heard of this one. When a text compares two or more ideas, that's a compare and contrast. The compare step discusses similarities, how things are similar. And then the contrast step discusses how those things are different."
Language,"Look for clue words like same or different, both and neither, in contrast, or on the other hand. Here's an example. When talking about pizza, a long-standing debate is often between deep-dish and thin-crust pizza. One benefit of deep-dish pizza is how efficient it is. Because of its thickness, a 12-inch deep-dish pie can serve six people. One drawback is that it can be quite messy to eat."
Language,"Thin-crust pizza is good because it's less messy than deep-dish, but it's thin, so it takes a larger pizza, or multiple pizzas, to feed the same number of people as a deep-dish pizza can. Cause and effect. This one does what it says on the tin, right? It describes how one idea or event causes another. Here's an example. To celebrate my great report card, my parents let me order pizza with all my favorite toppings. After we ate, we were too stuffed to do anything else."
Language,"Now, what caused us to get pizza? My great report card. What was the effect of the pizza? We were stuffed. Maybe it was a stuffed pizza. If you stuff yourself with stuffed pizza, does that make you more stuffed than if you stuff yourself with unstuffed pizza? You may scoff, but this is the stuff that keeps me up at night. Problem and solution. In this kind of text structure, the author describes a problem and then explains how that problem was solved."
Language,"So imagine you want pizza, but you can't have traditional pizza because you're a celiac. You can't have wheat. Necessity is the mother of invention. Enter the cauliflower crust pizza made from cooked cauliflower, cheese, and a variety of gluten-free flours. All right, so what was the problem? You can't eat wheat and pizza dough is made of wheat. How do you solve that problem? By making pizza crust out of cauliflower, which I promise tastes better than it sounds. Finally, description."
Language,"This is sort of like an encyclopedia entry that explains basic information about a topic. Like an explainer piece about what pizza is. I'm going to read this as though I have never heard of pizza before. (clears throat) Pizza, a round flatbread traditionally served warm, originated in Naples, Italy in the 19th century. This flatbread is generally baked at very high temperatures, topped with flavorful tomato sauce and melted mozzarella cheese and served in slices."
Language,"If you find yourself looking at an informational text and you're struggling to figure out what the structure is, subtract the specifics. If you subtract the specifics, it'll help you think about the structure. And if it helps, you can substitute those specific details about the text with pizza. Is this silly? Yeah, of course. Does it work? I think it does. So is the text structured like a recipe or the history of pizza? If so, it's chronology."
Language,"Is it comparing two kinds of pizza? Well, then it's a compare and contrast. Does it explain how a good report card led to a pizza dinner? It's cause and effect. Does it explain a pizza problem and how it was solved in a pizza way? Well, that's a problem-solution structure. And finally, does it straightforwardly describe what a pizza is without a detailed chronology, comparison, or problem? Because if so, that's a description. Those are only five possible ways to structure a piece of writing."
Language,"They're by no means the only ways. But identifying these will give you the tools to learn even more structures so that you can better understand how writers shape ideas. I hope that this helped. And I also hope that you want pizza now, because I certainly do. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"And sometimes that purpose will be harder to see. As readers, our job is to consider the author's purpose as we read. How is it influencing the information the author shares? How is it influencing my understanding of the topic? Is what I think the same as what the author thinks? Do I agree with them? Do I disagree? You may be familiar with the memory device of P.I.E., persuade, inform, entertain, as three categories of purpose. But I'd like to go deeper than that."
Language,"I live in Washington, D.C., which is home to an entire professional class of what are called lobbyists, people whose job it is to advocate to Congress on behalf of a special interest, for example, the oil industry or the cheese industry. This isn't always bad. You can learn more about lobbyists and advocates in Khan Academy's Government and Politics course. But frequently, it takes the form of someone from an industry trying to convince Congress to give them a competitive advantage over other industries."
Language,"Now, let's pull real-world politics out of this and pretend for the purposes of this lesson that there are two warring lobbying groups in D.C. One that represents the cake industry, and another that represents the pie industry. An age-old conflict. So hold that conflict in your mind for a second, cake versus pie. Now, when we read informational text, we should be learning new information. But the author's opinions can shape the text to the point where the information becomes biased or misleading."
Language,"When you read informational text, maintain an air of healthy skepticism. Ask yourself the following questions constantly. What's the author's opinion? What information did they include, or what information did they leave out? And if so, was that on purpose? What's the connotation of the author's word choice? You know, how do the words feel? And what's the overall tone of the piece? So now we have these questions to ask ourselves, let's return to our pie versus cake lobby fight in Washington."
Language,"So imagine you're reading ""The Washington Post,"" and you see this opinion column. ""Cake Connected to Cavities ""and Poor Dental Health, Study Finds."" ""A recent study by the American Dental Association ""connected the consumption of cake or similar foods ""with a 30% increased risk of tooth decay, ""cavities, and gingivitis. ""People who reported having consumed cake ""in the previous 60 days were significantly more likely ""to experience problems related to dental health ""than those people who did not."
Language,"""Cake is dangerous. ""Cake, which rarely contains fruit, will rot your teeth."" And then if we squint down at the very bottom of the column, it'll say in small text, ""The author is the CEO ""of Circular Solutions, a pie-advocacy network."" And now let's ask ourselves those same questions again while acknowledging that this is a fake story that I made up for the purposes of this video. There is nobody named Wendell Apricotjam, although I wish there were, that'd be a great name."
Language,"So, what's the author's opinion? Well, it seems to me that the author really thinks cake is dangerous and poses a threat to the nation's dental health. We know this because they literally say ""cake is dangerous."" They want people to buy and eat fewer cakes. What information did the author choose to include? Well, so this is interesting."
Language,"The author talks about the results of this study and the big takeaways about the danger of cake or similar foods, and then they go on to mention incidentally that cake rarely contains fruit. That's a curious thing to say. It's almost like they're saying, ""Pie, which has fruit in it, is better for you than cake,"" without actually saying it."
Language,"What information did the author choose to leave out? Well, notice that the piece says ""cake or similar foods."" I would be hard-pressed to come up with a definition of foods similar to cake that does not also include desserts like pie. But the way that this piece is written, it swerves out of its way to avoid pinning the same tooth decay risks on pie the way that it blames cake."
Language,"I think it would be reasonable to assume that if we read the underlying study that this opinion piece is based on, it would include pies and cakes in the same category of sugary desserts that are associated with bad dental outcomes. Why would the author do this? Well, they want you to buy pie instead of cake. But they don't want you to think too hard about it because if you did, you would buy and eat both less cake and less pie. And the pie lobby doesn't want that."
Language,"What's the connotation or the feeling of the author's word choices? Well, they're citing a scientific study by dentists, so they want you to take their warning seriously, and they're using words like risk and danger, rot and problems. They want you to make an association between eating cake and bad tooth health. They want you to associate scientific language with trustworthiness. So I'm gonna put down scientific authority here. What's the overall tone? It's negative."
Language,"The author does not want you to eat cake. They want you to think it's bad, and they've planted a little hint here that fruity foods are better. And what's a fruity food? Can they say pie is safer? No, not without lying outright. Now, I wanna be clear about two things. Sometimes an author's purpose really will just be to inform straightforwardly. Not everything has to be a tug-of-war between you and the author over the truth."
Language,"Sometimes a writer just wants you to know the lifecycle of a butterfly, or how to make egg salad, or the order the U.S. presidents came in. But most of the time, there's a purpose, an opinion, behind the text. Now, the second thing I wanna be super clear about is that I made up this whole thing. I made up the article, the statistics, Wendell, you know, all of that's fake. I like both pie and cake very much."
Language,"And now that I've said that, I'm sure you're wondering, ""Oh, is David in the pocket of big dessert?"" And the answer is no. I'm in the pocket of big free education for everyone everywhere. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"""This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why."" Argument does not sneak, it does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories: data, fact, observable reality. There is a place for pure subjective opinion, and it is the realm of the movie and the restaurant review."
Language,"""I did not like this movie because I didn't laugh at its jokes."" ""I did not enjoy the hamburger I got because I found it too dry for my liking."" This is not what we're talking about today. Obviously, argument is rooted in opinion and subjective personal preferences, but those opinions need to be backed up with evidence. Let's compare arguments for and against a tax on soda."
Language,"Now, this writer argues that sugar contributes to obesity, and therefore, people should be prevented from buying soda, which is full of sugar on the grounds that it is bad for them, let's take a look. The soda tax could alter many people's behavior, causing them to stop buying sugary drinks. Some foods are necessities like milk, eggs, and bread. People will buy them even if the prices increase. Sugary drinks aren't necessary."
Language,"If the price goes up, people will buy fewer sugary drinks and they won't be consuming as much sugar, therefore, the obesity rate will go down. Whereas this author counters that people have a right to make what they see as unhealthy decisions. Soda and other sugary drinks have been targeted because they lack nutrition and are basically just liquid sugar. Most people would agree that proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
Language,"However, do legislators have the right or responsibility to regulate people's sugar intake in order to improve their health? I say, no. All right, let's evaluate these claims. For the first argument in favor of the soda tax, how do we know this is true? What evidence does this author give that this tax will alter people's behavior? What evidence does this author give that sugary drinks aren't seen to be as essential as milk? After all, not everyone can or does drink milk."
Language,"In the piece, the evidence that the author gives us is this table, which shows how much sugar is in soda per serving, but it doesn't use evidence to connect sugar consumption to unhealthy outcomes. All this says is, soda has a lot of sugar. I wanna see evidence, I wanna see studies. How do we know this tax would change behavior? Good readers think through the impacts of an argument."
Language,"If this tax went into effect, what would the consequences be? Are there faults in the author's logic? It might stop some people from buying soda, but in an unfair way. Here's how I'm processing this as a reader. If you take a bottle of soda that previously costs, say $2, and the tax makes it $10, that will make it more difficult to purchase. But to a millionaire, the difference between $2 and $10 is basically nothing. Whereas to a poor or middle class person, that $8 difference adds up pretty quickly."
Language,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary."
Language,"So now I'm asking, whose responsibility is it to determine how much sugar is in a drink? Why is sugar so inexpensive to begin with? Do legislators have a responsibility there? Now we know it's not legal to bottle rat poison and sell it as tea, but whose responsibility is that? What isn't this author saying, and how does not saying it serve their argument? They're not saying what the government could or should do, only what it shouldn't do."
Language,"And this is why I want you to be skeptical whenever you read anyone's argument about anything. You need to figure out what the terms of the debate are. What does the argument assume as a given? What's a problem worth fixing? What are the trade offs that the writer thinks are acceptable? So when you encounter an argument in text, look for the claims, and then look to see if those claims are backed up with data-supported reasoning."
Language,"Is the author using evidence and logic? Do they anticipate objections to their arguments and push back on or incorporate those critiques? Above all else, I want you to remain skeptical. Everyone's selling something, even me. It's just the thing I'm trying to sell you is the fundamental idea that you can learn anything. You've got this, Readers. David out.."
Language,"It's like a series of jumps. Listening to myself say that, it doesn't feel very clear to me. At least it's certainly less clear than this moving image of a galloping horse. Sometimes the most efficient way to express information is to present it visually, to see it in order to best understand it. And so we're going to talk today about graphs and charts, your friends and mine. This video is no longer about horses. I apologize if I gave that impression."
Language,"I did give a pretty obvious title when I said quantitative information in texts. But to those of you who I've misled, I'm sorry. Now, graphs are one of many ways we can make visual representations of data, information you can see, news you can use. And I guess a question that follows from that is why do it? Why make a graph and a chart? What does that have to do with writing? Well, visualizing data can make an argument stronger."
Language,"Let's say my neighborhood is having a bake sale to raise money for, I don't know, a carnival. And some of my neighbors have peanut allergies, so I want to write to the neighborhood council to say let's make sure that the baked goods don't have peanuts in them so the whole neighborhood can participate without fear of having an allergic attack. That's supposed to be a peanut. I realize it kinda looks like a dog treat, but let's pretend that's a peanut."
Language,"Now, good readers know that data is important to informational text, so as a writer, I wanna make sure that I'm backing up my claims with a chart. Here's the text of the letter I'd send to my neighborhood council: Dear Neighborhood Council, I'm writing to ask that you officially ban peanuts and tree nuts from the baked goods on offer during our upcoming carnival bake sale. Over a fifth of residents surveyed reported some kind of food allergy. Please see attached graph."
Language,"If we want to have their full participation in this fundraiser, we cannot permit foods that will send them to the hospital. All my best, David. Now, let's take a look at that graph. These are made-up numbers in a made-up situation. But let's say I interviewed 50 of my neighbors, and 40 of them here report no allergies, but 10 of them do. So we can have this bar graph that breaks down those allergies by type. One person is allergic to strawberries. Two people are allergic to peanuts."
Language,"Four people are allergic to tree nuts, like pecans or walnuts. And three people have multiple food allergies. And then we have this bar here that shows all the folks that don't have food allergies. That's the other 40. To put it another way, here's a pie chart of that same data set showing just how many people in the neighborhood have allergies in total. It's just a different way of looking at it."
Language,"This is all the same data, but we can see that the percentage of people surveyed who have allergies adds up to 20% of the total. Something that's in the letter but not the graphs is the idea that these are very serious allergies. If the wrong person ate a peanut, they could have a medical emergency. If the council were to look at just the graph alone, they might say, ""Eh, it's not that many people. ""Peanuts are great, let's include them."" But combined with the text, the stakes become more clear."
Language,And they may better understand the consequences of having nuts at the bake sale. And something that's in the graph that isn't in the letter is the breakdown of allergies by type. Maybe the council could decide that the one person with a strawberry allergy is an acceptable risk and that strawberry baked goods are kind of obvious-looking and easy to avoid in a way that brownies with walnuts in them aren't.
Language,"This visual information allows the neighborhood council to get my point more efficiently than just the words alone. It helps me express a sort of complicated idea that peanuts and other allergens in the bake sale might constitute too much of a risk to my neighbors and that they shouldn't be allowed. Now, there are other questions like is this a representative data set? But that's a question that can be better answered by our statistics course. For now, think about it this way."
Language,"As a reader, your job is to look at everything that is on the page, not just the text. Then think about what both the data and the words do for your understanding. Data and informational text are two great tastes that go great together. One can support the other and vice versa, you know, like chocolate and peanut butter. Oh, no, sorry, bad example, like chocolate and sunflower butter. You know what I mean. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"At the time of this recording, I'm 31 and I run into new and confusing words every day. I read a lot and it's always a fun challenge to run into words like, I don't know, glabrous or limned or nacreous. I know a lot about language and even I have trouble figuring out what those words mean on their own. So it's important to rely on context, the language that surrounds the word. Let's say you're reading a text and you come across a sentence that has a word in it you don't recognize."
Language,"Here's a bit from a passage about the famous chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. ""Jane Goodall arrived at Tanzania's ""Gombee Stream National Park in 1960. ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers. ""After all, she had not yet been to college."" So let's pause on unconventional. What does that word mean? Well, let me give you some ideas, that's the memory aid I use to keep it straight."
Language,"IDEAS, it stands for inference, definition, example, antonym, synonym, I-D-E-A-S, IDEAS, which are all different kinds of context clues. Every word will have a different context, so you might need to vary your approach. The way this snippet is written let's try inference first, then I'll rewrite the sentence a few times to show you the other methods. Okay, the I in IDEAS, inference. We can draw conclusions from the context."
Language,"If we don't know what unconventional means, we can take a look at the rest of the sentence or other nearby sentences to figure it out. Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal."
Language,"And because I'm making an inference about this word's meaning I wanna keep an eye out for it in other places to see if I can confirm or revise that working definition later. D - definition. Context clues like these will just give you the definition of the word in question. So a good example of that would be: ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers."
Language,"""She hadn't been to college yet, ""and this made her different and unexpected."" Different and unexpected is a great definition for the word unconventional. This style of context clue occurs when the author expects a word to be unfamiliar to you and builds in a guide for you right there in the text. The E in IDEAS stands for example, and this is somewhere between inference and definition. If the author describes Goodall as unconventional, they'll go on to talk about something unconventional that Goodall did."
Language,"""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among animal researchers. ""For one thing, she hadn't been to college yet."" So this is very similar to that initial sentence, except for the transition phrase for one thing, which is a way to set up examples. Antonym - an antonym is a word whose meaning is the opposite of another word, like how night is the opposite of day, or how love is the opposite of hate."
Language,"So if there's an example in the text of what Jane Goodall was not, we can use that to figure out what she was. So let's say the passage said: ""Goodall was unconventional. ""She didn't conform, and she wasn't ordinary."" There we have two antonyms and our answer. Similarly, synonym just means write another word with the same meaning similar to a definition. ""Jane Goodall was unconventional. ""She was a nonconformist."
Language,"""She went against the grain."" You can see that I had to rewrite the sentences each time to apply to each context clue strategy, which shows me that you won't find all five context clues every time you need to search for a word's meaning. You need to find the approach that makes the most sense in context. See what I did there, ah huh? And failing that, you can always look up an unfamiliar word in a dictionary. I love to do that."
Language,"I think that's great, but I also feel a sense of victory when I correctly figure out what a new word means, when I've put it together from context. And maybe if I'm still curious, I look it up later and then I turn out to be right, and I'm all like ""Victory at sea, I did it!"" Oh, and if you were curious, glabrous means smooth and hairless like a leaf or the skin of a frog. Nacreous means shiny and rainbow colored like the inside of an oyster shell."
Language,"And to limn something means to draw the outline of or to be highlighted in light. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I don't literally mean that I've got a bear. That would be extremely sweet. Love a bear, love bear's whole thing with the snacking and the sleeping and the eating of fish, but no. A bear of is a figurative expression that means something difficult. So a bear of a lesson is a difficult lesson and that's what we're talking about today. Not bears, sorry, but non-literal uses of language, which we call figurative language or figures of speech. Figurative language says one thing but means another."
Language,"I could say that my colleague Allison is an eagle-eyed editor and when I say that I don't mean that she literally has an eagle's eyes in her head. That would be a terrifying achievement of medical science. No, I'm saying that she is sharp and attentive in the same way that an eagle is. So I'm saying something that is not literally true in order to express something that is true, that Allison is good at editing. Would you call that a lie? I'm not sure I would."
Language,"It's just a non-literal way of expressing myself. So, having gotten the question of whether or not I'm a dirty rotten liar out of the way, let's talk about some different varieties of figurative language. First, the simile. A simile is a comparison between two things that uses like or as. If I were really hungry, I could say that my stomach was gurgling like a tar pit or that I was as hungry as a ravenous wolf, and again, neither of these things are literally true."
Language,"If my stomach were making actual tar pit noises, I would probably need to go to a hospital. But what do those examples tell you about the way that I, the speaker, think about my hunger? Animals and people get stuck in tar pits, they're gloppy, they pull things into them, they slow things down. Sorry T-Rex. Therefore, I'm saying that my hunger is slowing me down. Or, if I'm comparing myself to a wolf, you can imagine me looking lean and desperate, saliva dripping from my jaws at the mere thought of food."
Language,"I could really go for a cheese danish come to think of it. So that's simile. The second figure of speech I wanna talk about today is the metaphor. And what's a metaphor? Cows and sheep! Sorry, I couldn't help it. No, a metaphor is not a meadow for. Metaphors are another way of comparing two things, but this time there's no like or as. We're walking this language tightrope without a net now."
Language,"You aren't signaling with like or as that you're making a figurative comparison, so you have to use context to communicate clearly. At the beginning of this video I said this was going to be a bear of a lesson. That's a metaphor. There's a Linda Ronstadt country song from the 70s, called ""Love is a Rose,"" which is all about how to take care of a relationship through the metaphor of tending a flower with thorns on it."
Language,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person."
Language,"To say that differently, it's ascribing human characteristics to non-living things. The wind howled through the mountains. The car grumbled as I threw it into gear. The storm raged. These are things that people do, but I'm applying that language to inanimate things, like wind and cars and storms in order to express the way these things are behaving. The car is not literally grumbling, ""Aw man, I can't believe David has to drive me today."" It's making noises that I am choosing to identify as unhappy."
Language,"The greatest kind of figurative language in the entire universe is hyperbole. By exaggerating, I'm expressing emphasis and importance. This summer, I'm going to read a million books and eat a literal actual ton of hot dogs. This is not true. In fact, this is impossible. That is too many hot dogs, those are too many books, each of which are sentences I never expected to say, but I'm trying to express my enthusiasm for both books and encased meats, and I'm doing that by being, you know, extra."
Language,"The final kind of expressive language I wanna talk about today isn't exactly figurative language, it's the language of allusions and references. Where you make comparisons to characters or events from literature, or movies, or culture. Also note that it's allusion with an A, as opposed to illusion with an I. An illusion with an I is like a magic trick. Here are some examples of allusions. Oh, you'd have to be Superman to lift that fallen tree. Or, you have a Gollum-like obsession with that stuffed animal."
Language,"Now these comparisons only work if the person you're talking to understands the reference. Superman has super strength, Gollum, from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" can't stop talking about how much he loves this one object, the ring. If you don't know the reference, then it's all just noise. One tip is to read up on mythology. You'd be surprised how many times ancient gods, like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo come up as you read. So that's what we're working with here. Simile, love is like a rose."
Language,"Metaphor, love is a rose. Personification, my car grumbled. Hyperbole, my mom grounded me for eight trillion years. And allusion, I feel mightier than Hercules. That's figurative language folks. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Tone communicates how an author feels about the topic they're writing about, this can come across in a number of different ways, it can reflect their enthusiasm or skepticism, it can also communicate formality or informality, an academic paper or a speech before the UN, for example are very different things from a toast at a wedding or a thank you card for a birthday gift and this kind of difference in tone is something that sociologists and linguists call register."
Language,"Social conventions and customs call for different registers in different circumstances, just as it would be inappropriate in most situations to wear a tuxedo at the beach, so too would it be incongruous to use extremely formal language in an informal setting? (melodic orchestral music) (clearing throat) Dear honored sir, it was the privilege of my very life to have you attend my 14th birthday party. I am grateful beyond words for your most generous gift, a check for $36 American."
Language,"Your humble and obedient servant, David. In fact using extremely formal language and high-minded gratitude for something as relatively small as a birthday gift might even come across as sarcastic or insulting. But this is sort of an extreme example, let's pull back and discuss how an understanding of tone can aid you in making sense of informational texts."
Language,"One great way to do that is to analyze word choice, we can look at a writer's language and determine their attitude towards the subject based on the words they've chosen to describe it. Oceans of ink have been spilled over comparisons between a Chicago style hotdog and a New York style hotdog. The first with its garden's worth of toppings, but a holier than now prohibition of ketchup, the latter with its sauerkraut, mustard and dubious dirty water cooking style."
Language,"But scant attention, a droplet of ink before the ocean has been paid to the half-smoke, the unsung but mighty regional sausage of Washington DC. Now how does the author think about the subject? Well, we know that they think that not enough writing has been done about DC's regional sausage, the half-smoke, but how do they feel about it? How do the words they use express their feelings? Let's break it down bit by bit."
Language,"So right out of the gate, we have oceans of ink, this is a deliberate piece of overstatement, there are no literal oceans made of ink, but it's being set up in opposition to the droplet of ink used to describe half-smokes later in the paragraph."
Language,"Half-smokes are described as unsung, but mighty, which suggests that they haven't been given their due, there hasn't been enough praise for half-smokes and that therefore the amount of attention given to Chicago and New York hotdogs is unfair or even disproportionate. I think we can also determine from word choice, that the author thinks a Chicago hot dog is a little ridiculous and that a New York hot dog is a little gross."
Language,"How do we know this? Chicagoans generally don't like ketchup on their hotdogs and the way the author phrases this is by saying, that they have a holier than thou prohibition on ketchup, which is to say they get all haughty and upset about it, which is weird because it's ketchup, listen, I'm a Chicagoan by birth, I used to feel this way and I'm not even sure why."
Language,"Similarly the word dubious in the description of the New York hotdog, meaning doubtful suggests that the dirty water cooking method is kind of nasty sounding, why would the author do this? Is it to say these are terrible hot dogs and nobody should eat them? No, I don't think so, The author is trying to make room for the half-smoke in the national sausage conversation and to do that, they're first trying to dismantle the importance of New York and Chicago style by making fun of them."
Language,"These are tactical choices, not to be confused with authorial voice, which is a different concept entirely an author's voice is their style, it's much more consistent across topics, whereas a tone is specific to a topic. So I might have an authorial voice, that uses a lot of goofy wordplay, but I use a sympathetic tone to talk about bears and a hostile tone to talk about, I don't know, whales, yeah, boo whales, I said it. I do not actually hate whales, I love whales."
Language,"But my point is this, use your knowledge of words, of the connotation and implications of the language, that an author might use to unlock your understanding of their tone, because if you can do that, my friend, you can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word. This is distinct from denotation, which is more like the dictionary definition of a word. Companion and buddy both have similar denotations. They both mean friend, but companion is a much more formal sounding word than buddy. Which originated as a piece of slang from the 19th century."
Language,"So even though their denotation or their literal definition is the same, they feel different. The connotation of companion is formal while the connotation of buddy is friendly and casual. Good readers pay close attention to the words the author chose to use. They picked those words for a reason. How do those words make you feel? What is the author trying to imply? How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"using details from a text to make inferences, aren't you? - [Sherlock Bones] Yes, my boy! It's simplicity itself. But first, let me deduce a few things about you, shall I? -    Well, Mr. Bones, we're trying to do this about writing, not about people, so... - [Bones] Give me your hand. -    Waugh! - [Bones] Ah, you like to cook, you have a nervous disposition and you work for Khan Academy."
Language,"-    Now how did you know that? - [Bones] You have a callus on your finger from how you hold a knife, your fingernails are bitten, not clipped and your messenger bag says Khan Academy. -    Well and I told you who I was before I showed up. - [Bones] That too. -    But what does this have to do with reading a book? - [Bones] I correctly deduced several truths about your person based on clues, my good David. Indeed, all inference is making sense of clues."
Language,"When you read a story, you are constantly making inferences. -    I see. Okay, I'll read a passage and then see what I can make of it. An hour later, thick smoke poured up the stairs. The smoke detector screamed and I could hear Uncle Paleo stumbling around with the fire extinguisher. When he came upstairs afterward, his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. He was a wreck, broken glasses, black smudges on his face and singed hair."
Language,"Okay, so I can surmise that there was some kind of fire or explosion downstairs, where the character Uncle Paleo was. - [Bones] Hm, how do you know? -    Well his hair was singed, that's another word for burned and his face was covered in black smudges like you get from soot from a fire and there was all the smoke and the smoke detector went off. - [Bones] And there is also the matter of the fire extinguisher. -    Also that. - [Bones] I see something else in that passage too."
Language,"-    What's that, Mr. Bones? - [Bones] Uncle Paleo was exhausted by putting out the fire. -    How can you tell? Where does it say that? - [Bones] Well, it doesn't. That's inference, my lad. Note here how it said his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. Why might that be? -    He stepped in something sticky. No, oo, he's wearing shoes made of lead. - [Bones] Well, those are indeed possible explanations but you want to think of the most likely option."
Language,"-    He was running around to put the fire out and it made him tired. - [Bones] So, you were reading between the lines, were you? Drawing conclusions from the text? -    I was. So we know for sure Uncle Paleo was tired, right? - [Bones] WE DO NOT, SIR. -    Oh!! - [Bones] An inference is only one possible conclusion but is not the only conclusion. -    So what are we to do? - [Bones] The more clues you discover, the stronger your inferences will become."
Language,"You have to look at what you already know about a character, about the setting of the story, the events of a story's plot and piece it together from there. You know that fires create lots of black dust or soot so it strengthens your argument in favor of a fire. And it's background knowledge like that, about the way the world works that will serve you as a reader and as a maker of inferences. Apply what you know to the world of the story and make inferences based on that."
Language,"-    And then, I can become the world's greatest consulting detective? - [Bones] You can become like the world's 50th greatest consulting detective, top of the heap's rather full, I'm afraid. -    Well, thank you for your time today, Mr. Bones. Best of luck with your case work. - [Bones] Thank you; I shan't need it. (barks) -    You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"When you read, or when you interact with any kind of fiction, watch carefully for how characters change over time."
Language,"How do characters in a text interact with each other? Does the way a character react to events change over the course of the story? What's changed and why? One of my favorite pieces of fiction of all time is ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" and while he isn't the main character, I think the character of Prince Zuko has one of the best illustrations of character change across the course of the show."
Language,"So spoilers ahoy! But Zuko goes from being an antagonist in the first few seasons, to officially joining the protagonists, the good guys, in the final season of the show. I appreciate how the creators of the show map Zuko's growth and change, because we can see him unlearning old, bad habits and taking on new, more productive ways of behaving as the show progresses."
Language,"He fundamentally changes as a person, and it's the result of a lot of hard work on his part and a lot of love and patience from the people who care about him. Zuko is what is called a dynamic character, which is to say that he changes throughout the story. This is the opposite of a static character, who does not change."
Language,"There's a running gag in the ""Avatar"" series about this one hapless cabbage merchant who keeps on showing up in various cities only to have the protagonists knock his cabbage cart over again and again. Pretty much the only thing he says in the course of the whole show is his catchphrase, ""My cabbages!"" He doesn't learn, he doesn't grow, he only suffers. Cabbage guy, static character, Zuko, dynamic character."
Language,"Many main characters are dynamic, but secondary and background characters, like the cabbage guy are static. So what causes character change in stories? Other people and events. Let's take a look at an example from our website, ""Oscar's Musical Odyssey."" Oscar begins the story by telling his friends on the soccer team that he can't hang out with them that night, he's gotta go to the symphony with his parents."
Language,"His teammates mock him and he feels bad: Oscar was hesitant to say it out loud, as he knew exactly what would happen when his friends found out where he was going. ""I have to go to the symphony tonight,"" he said quietly. The water in Kevin's mouth exploded into the air, propelled by the laughter that closely followed. ""The symphony, hey fellas,"" Kevin exclaimed, as his voice rose to address everyone within ear shot."
Language,"""Guess where El Capitan Rico over here is going? ""He's gonna go sip tea and listen to the symphony!"" Instantly the other soccer guys joined in mocking Oscar. ""I didn't know you had a thing for old gringo music,"" laughed Lorenzo. ""What's next, bro,"" shouted Juan, ""watching the evening news in your bathrobe?"" ""What kind of soccer player goes to the symphony?"" said Javier. Oscar sighed. He knew this would happen."
Language,"although he loved the camaraderie he had with the guys on the soccer team, the amount of grief he was going to get over a stupid night out with his parents was going to be rough, very rough. While Oscar almost always felt tight with this group, this was stirring up some feelings of isolation within him. So this is how Oscar reacts. He's hesitant, he's embarrassed because of how his friends feel about his symphony plans. They're not even his plans, his parents are making him go."
Language,"Good readers ask themselves how do characters treat each other? Oscar's friends think listening to classical music is something for old white dudes or fancy tea-drinking nerds, but whatever it is, it's definitely not for soccer players. But then Oscar attends the symphony and he is bewitched by what he hears. The experience changes him."
Language,"So we can ask how do events change how characters behave? Well, let's return to the text: On the way home Oscar's mom said, ""I know this wasn't what you would have chosen for tonight, ""but I hope you enjoyed it."" ""I thought it was great,"" said Oscar, ""I had no idea, I was so wrapped up in what the guys ""were saying about me that I didn't give it a chance. ""I bet they would love this music,"" he said. ""Maybe,"" said his dad, ""but if they don't, does it matter?"" And that's when Oscar understood something."
Language,"His whole identity didn't have to be defined by only one or two things. Who he was could be a mix, in interwoven harmony of many things. We can look to the text to provide evidence of Oscar's change. He has this moment of clarity in the car after the symphony. He realizes he doesn't have to be either a soccer player or a guy who enjoys symphonies, he can be both at once."
Language,"So when you're evaluating a character, ask yourself for specific choices that characters make, dialogue exchanges, or interactions with other characters, or responses to story events. Compare similar events at different points of the story. Does a character react in the same way at the story's beginning versus how they might react in the middle or near the end of it? If no, what's changed and why? If you can answer those questions, congratulations! You've identified the dynamic character."
Language,You can learn anything. David out. My cabbages!.
Language,"What, your saying, how do you map a story? What makes a story pointy? These are great questions, and to answer them, I'll say this, today we're going to talk about the elements of a story, or the parts that make it up, like ingredients in a recipe. Many stories follow a similar pattern. Good readers know what these patterns are, and can talk about them using the right terms. And this helps everyone be on the same page, so to speak, when you discuss or write about the stories you read."
Language,"I'm about to drop a lot of vocabulary on you, so brace yourselves. The story begins with exposition, where we learn about the characters and the setting. Then, we introduce a conflict, or a big problem. As the characters begin to interact with the conflict or try to solve the problem, we enter rising action. This upward slope of the story mountain. When the conflict comes to a head, we hit the most exciting part of the story, the climax. Here, the conflict can't go any further."
Language,"We're at the top of the mountain. There's nowhere else to go, except down. After the climax, after this most exciting part of the story, we enter falling action. The climax will happen much closer to the end of the story than to the middle. It's not a symmetrical mountain. The action slows down. The problem has been solved, or maybe the problem has changed, and the characters prepare for the last phase of story, the resolution."
Language,"This is where we tie up loose ends, characters reflect on what they learned, maybe you set up a sequel. Now, look, that was a lot of information all at once. In order to make sense of it, let's apply all of those terms to a story."
Language,"Now, our go-to has been the Three Little Pigs, and while that's a story everyone knows, I'm starting to think it needs to be freshened up a little bit, really working its franchise potential, you know? So let's go through the elements of story by looking at my new project, a reboot of Three Little Pigs that I'm calling TLP: Starbound. See, it's Three Little Pigs, but it's in space. That's a space helmet. So I'm gonna put a little story map here in the corner. Okay, so the exposition. It's the future."
Language,"Pigs have expanded to every corner of the galaxy. Three brave little pigs decide to strike out on their own, exploring a new, exciting region of space. One builds a spaceship out of straw. Go with me here. One builds a spaceship out of twigs. And one builds a spaceship out of flexible hyper alloy they developed in a laboratory. She's the brainy pig. So, we've got the setting. It's the future, they're in space. We've got our characters, the pigs. Now, the conflict."
Language,"Along comes the notorious space pirate, Captain Wolf. He's big, he's bad, he wants to blow up the spaceships and eat the pigs. He begins hunting down the pig ships, one at a time. Think Captain Wolf has an eye patch? No, he has a cyber eye; he's part robot. And now we enter our rising action phase. Captain Wolf engages the straw ship. They have an exciting space battle. (instructor making shooting noises) And straw pig escapes in the little escape pod to the twig ship! But Captain Wolf follows."
Language,"He is undaunted. The tension continues to rise. He destroys the twig ship! (instructor making shooting noises) The two pigs escape again, this time to the brick house. I mean, the flexible hyper alloy spaceship, piloted by the science pig. And now, we come to the climax. Captain Wolf comes to the advanced ship. He tries to blow it up, but he can't! It's too powerful. He decides to board the ship, because that's the only way he'll get to eat the pigs."
Language,"But the pigs trap him in a space barrel while he's still in the airlock. They did it! They solved the problem. Captain Wolf is trapped in a space barrel, and he can't eat them now. The climax is passed, and now we enter the falling action phase of the story. In the version of the story that I know, the three little pigs roll the barrel in to the river."
Language,"So I think maybe in this version they punt the space barrel out the airlock in to the cold void of space! Or maybe they strand him on a deserted planet, but in any case, they never have to deal with the wolf again. The threat is now gone. And that means that the conflict has been resolved. We're in the resolution part of the story now. The first two little pigs, the straw ship pig and the twig ship pig, learned that they need to put more work in to their spaceships if they wanna survive in space."
Language,"And they build fancy spaceships just like the science pig. And that's an introduction to story elements. Now that you're familiar with the ideas, start applying them to your favorite stories. You can do this with any form of media: books, comics, TV shows, movies, games. What's the conflict? How is it resolved? Once you start looking for story structure in entertainment, you will find it everywhere. Let us now what you see. You can learn anything; David, out.."
Language,"Drama, also known as theater or plays, is a specialized kind of story that is meant to be performed. If you've ever seen a movie, a television show or a play, or if you've ever heard a play on the radio or through a podcast, you've experienced the magic of the dramatic arts. Writing a drama is different than writing a poem or story. And that means that reading one is different, too. So I'm gonna show you part of a short drama on the Khan Academy website in order to go through the parts of a play."
Language,"Okay, so here we have the title of the piece, My Unusual Aunt. But it's followed by something you maybe haven't seen before which is the Cast of Characters. This tells us who's in the play, a 12 year old named Isabella, and her aunt Yasmin. Now these are the characters the actors will be performing in the drama. There may be other people referenced. Like for example in this piece Isabella refers to her Dad being asleep in Scene Two. But he never shows up on stage."
Language,"A play is decided into scenes, which you can think of like chapters in a book. Scenes are sections of a drama that are separated by time or location. Scene One takes place in the evening outside. Scene Two takes place at Isabella's house some time later. How do we know that? The setting and stage directions. So this italic slanty text here in the brackets tells us where the scene is set in time and space. It says Evening: Isabella is walking her dog Stanley. A bat dives down."
Language,"The name Isabella is in all capital letters to make sure the actor playing Isabella notices. And from this we know several things. Isabella is in this scene, she's outside, she's walking her dog, and it's nighttime. So if this were a stage play, we'd maybe see a set that looks like Isabella's neighborhood. She's walking the dogs, maybe we'd see a little bit of sidewalk or a fire hydrant. There's more italics in this bit, and it what are called stage directions."
Language,"An actor wouldn't read this aloud during a performance. Instead, stage directions tell the team putting a drama together what is happening on stage. So a bat dives down. That's gonna be a puppet or a prop operated by a puppeteer or a stage hand. And then we have this line of dialogue spoken by Isabella reacting to the bat. Ugh, since when do we have bats in the neighborhood? C'mon Stanley, let's run home. So characters have lines. The character name indicates which character is speaking."
Language,"Sometimes you'll have a stage direction just before a line of dialogue, as we can see in Scene Two. And Yasmin points to a giant trunk before she talks, but the actor playing her wouldn't say pointing at giant trunk aloud. That's a physical action the script is asking her to perform. These are the basic components of a stage play."
Language,"The characters and their descriptions, the way the play is divided into scenes, the stage directions that tell actors and others what to do, and the lines of dialogue that actors have to deliver aloud. These are the building blocks of a play. And now that you know that, you know just enough to be dangerous. Go write a play! Tell it I sent you. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Once we've sussed out whose perspective a story or a poem is being told from, what's next? What else is there to talk about? Well, I think it's useful to remember that stories and poems don't just happen. They don't just suddenly, spontaneously exist. Creating them is work. And it's the result of a whole bunch of decisions made by a writer. So, who is the point-of-view character or characters? What does that mean for the story? Ultimately, a point of view is an author's decision."
Language,"So, when an author chooses to center a story on one character, how does that change the story they tell? Would the story be different if it were centered on a different character? How does that point of view impact the way the story gets told? Imagine a rocket scientist with a mouse in her pocket, and they're going to inspect a spaceship under construction."
Language,"I'm gonna give you two little snippets in what's called close third person perspective, where there's a narrator, but their point of view is attached to a character. We get to see through their eyes, experience their thoughts. So, first, we're gonna hear from the rocket scientist. ""Leaving the lab, Dr. Harper strode confidently ""into the spaceship hangar, ""clipboard in hand, pet mouse in pocket."
Language,"""Launch day was only eight months away, ""and Project Juno still had so many bugs to work out, ""but she was certain that the test she'd conduct today ""would help her solve the air filter problem. ""The starship sat before her in a pool of light, ""a deep bluish-black craft, ""once an idea that had lived only in her mind, ""but now it was a real physical object. ""She dug around in her pocket ""and fed Persephone a sunflower seed."" Now, let's take that again from the mouse's perspective. ""Persephone T."
Language,"Mouse ""clung to the lip of Tatiana's jacket pocket, ""as they passed from a small cold room ""into a much larger, warmer, and brighter room. ""It had been four hours since she'd had anything to eat, ""and she was cranky. ""In the middle of the big, bright room ""was a big bluish black shape. ""Persophone didn't know what it was, ""and frankly, it looked kind of like a bird, ""which was weird and a little frightening."
Language,"""But it hadn't moved ""the last time Persephone and Tatiana were in there, ""and it wasn't moving now. ""So, Persephone guessed it was asleep. ""She chirped impatiently, ""and Tatiana gave her a sunflower seed."" You see, the same things happen in each story. Dr. Harper goes from her lab to the spaceship hangar, and then, she feeds her pet mouse a sunflower seed. But when we hang out with Harper's perspective, we get her thoughts and we see what she thinks is important."
Language,"But when we're reading from Persephone the mouse's perspective, she doesn't care about the spaceship, she doesn't know what it is. As readers, it's useful to ask how a writer is developing a character's point of view through a story. What are the abilities and limitations of a point-of-view character? Persephone the mouse is small. She can sneak through little holes in the wall or hide in the jacket pocket of a consenting human being. But Dr."
Language,"Harper has, you know, an astrophysics doctorate and opposable thumbs. She can open doors, design a spaceship, plan its flight trajectory. This is kind of an extreme example because one of these characters is a human being and the other one is a mouse. But even among different people, we can imagine very different stories. Characters and stories are just like real people. They have strengths and weaknesses, knowledge about some things and ignorance about others."
Language,"Sometimes, they tell the truth, and sometimes, they lie. This is especially important in first-person books, where everything we read comes to us directly from the point-of-view character. You have to open yourself up to the possibility that the narrator can be wrong about stuff. They can perceive things incorrectly, or be blinded by their own assumptions, or just be confused. They could also just be lying. But they could also just be innocently wrong and confused."
Language,They could look at a spaceship and think it's a bird. Narrators that are wrong or misinformed or actively trying to trick you are called unreliable narrators. Reading a book narrated by an unreliable narrator turns the relatively straightforward process of reading into a tug of war.
Language,"How do I know I can trust what the narrator is telling me? Ask yourself, what does a narrator think? What do they feel and what do they do? When you can answer all of those questions, you can begin to put their perspective into words. If you can identify the biases or the perspective or the ignorance of a point-of-view character, you can start to correct for it as you read, and use that understanding of the point of view to better understand the story as a whole."
Language,"Something important to remember is that the storytelling character is not the same thing as the author. The author creates those characters and is literally the person who writes the words. But if I wrote a story about an ogre who eats children, that does not make me an ogre who eats children. I would never eat children. They taste horrible. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"You'll notice it has almost no words in it, at least in this form. Now, let me show you the script. Pages three and four, panel one. A double-page spread, the whole greenhouse revealed, in widescreen. It's glorious. Wisps of steam curl up from bubbling patches of pool, green kelpy tendrils twine up the sides of the building. Everything is suffused with a delicate, green glow. Absent the gro-lights, some of the algae fluoresce in a range of cool-spectrum colors. But primarily greens."
Language,"Eugene is dwarfed by its almost cosmic magnificence. Caption, I can't describe it. None of that language, except for the caption, shows up in the final layout. All of that was me, the writer, giving art direction to Cour, the illustrator. Then they translated that language into their own version. I think it's a pretty faithful translation. My words are translated through Cour's design sensibilities and turned into artwork."
Language,"When you translate a written work into a different medium, whether it's illustrated, animated, recorded, or performed live it changes. It becomes a fundamentally different object. As readers, it's a valuable skill to explore how a text changes as it shifts from one medium to another. And when I say, medium, I mean a style of work, like a stage play, a film, a graphic novel, and audio drama, any of that. Good readers analyze those changes and use them to understand decisions that creators make."
Language,"If you're watching Romeo and Juliet and the director has made the decision to dress everyone in towering robot suits, a detail that is definitely not in the play as written, what does that decision tell you? What does it mean to you? Maybe you have had the experience of reading a book series that was important to you and then they made it into a movie and you were so excited to see the movie, and you sat down to see it and it was awful."
Language,"Like, they cast the wrong actors and they simplified the plot until it made no sense, and it just didn't feel right. That feeling is an example of this tension, this change, between a written material and its visual adaptation. Sometimes it can be bad, sometimes it can be good. Some readers can imagine what characters in books look or sound like, hearing them in their mind's ear, seeing them in their mind's eye."
Language,"The way your imagination renders a character is going to be different from how someone else's imagination does it. So let's compare the script for this audio drama we've got on Khan Academy, Hands Off My Phone, and let's compare that against the recorded version. So first, I'm going to put up the script and I'd like you to pause the video and just read it to yourself very quickly. And now let's take a listen to the recorded version. (upbeat music) (bell ringing) - [Sebastian] Oh no he didn't."
Language,"That is so harsh. - [Valentina] Right? - [Sebastian] Your dad took your phone away, just for getting a D on the history test? - [Valentina] Yep. - [Sebastian] My mind is blown. - [Valentina] Mine too. - [Sebastian] I mean, that was an easy test. - [Valentina] What? - [Sebastian] I can't believe you got a D. - [Valentina] Hey! That's not really-- - [Sebastian] And your dad is the school principal, and he took your phone away. Whoa. (chuckling) - [Valentina] You know, this isn't really helping."
Language,"- [Sebastian] Your life is so bleak right now. -    So you can read that script and think, oh hey, Sebastian is being earnestly sympathetic. Like, he really recognizes that his friend is hurting, but when you hear that performance the way I interpreted this line is that Sebastian is low-key roasting Valentina. He's not saying your life is so bleak in a kind way. He's rubbing salt into the wounds and being a dingus about it."
Language,"There's also other stuff that's not explicitly in the script like, that opening musical sting. (upbeat music) And the ringing of the bell. (bell ringing) Or those background school noises. All of that is meant to represent the fact that you're listening to a fictional show that takes place in a school setting. Does it work? That's for you to decide. When you watch or listen to a performance or a recording, or when you look at illustrations, ask yourself some questions."
Language,"For an audio piece, how do the sound effects, the acting decisions, and the music impact the story or affect the meaning of the words the characters say? How does the way an actor delivers a line change its emphasis? Was someone being sarcastic or sincere in a way you didn't expect, for example? For an illustrated story, how do those illustrations help you understand the author's tone and do you agree with those choices? Is the author's interpretation of the story the same as yours? For a TV show, or a movie, or a play, in addition to all the decisions made by actors about how to use their voices, shape their faces, or hold their bodies, how does the set tell the story? How do costumes tell the story? How does lighting or special effects impact the tone? For TV and film, how does the camera impact the way the story is told? The way a piece of film text is edited, its cuts, its angles, its rhythms, can help shape the way you, as a viewer, as a reader of visual text, understand it."
Language,"And if you can learn that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"(tense big band music) Friday was a very straightforward, almost relentless, character and the catchphrase associated with his character was ""Just the facts."" ""All we want are the facts, ma'am,"" was the sort of thing that he would say. And that's what we're talking about today: just the facts. There's this idea called objectivity. That you can talk about something without inserting any opinions which are personal thoughts or beliefs."
Language,"Doing this, being objective, is very difficult; opinions want to creep in. So what does it mean for a summary to be objective? It means it isn't influenced by feelings or opinions, it's not written in the first person, it's about the text, not me, and it's not a judgment or a review of the information. Let's be clear here; it's not bad to have opinions. In my opinion, it is good to have opinions, but they do not have a place in summaries. You can put opinions to use when you analyze or evaluate something."
Language,"When you're looking at summaries and you're trying to determine whether one is objective or not, look for words that cast judgment. Does the writer say something is good or terrible or useful or useless? Let's do this together. I'll take this text and summarize it without any opinions. Polar bears hunt for seals on thick sea ice in the Arctic. As the Earth grows warmer, though, sea ice gets thinner."
Language,"With less stable ground, some hungry polar bears search for food inland, often dangerously close to human environments. Although polar bears usually keep to themselves, a very scared or angry one could attack, and even eat, a human. Several villages have set up polar bear patrols as a result. The patrollers zoom around on snowmobiles, using bright lights and loud noises to scare away polar bears. Hopefully, the polar bears find another snack later on."
Language,"Here's my summary: Climate change causes polar bears to encroach on human habitats to search for food. As a consequence, these villages have set up polar bear patrols to frighten them away. As a person who cares about climate change, as well as the wellbeing of bears and human beings, I have all sorts of opinions about this, but for the purposes of summarizing that paragraph, I have to put them aside. Just the facts, ma'am."
Language,"(Dragnet theme) If you get good enough at making objective summaries, you'll start noticing when opinion creeps into things you expect to be objective. And it won't be obvious like bears are terrible and humans are right to scare them away or climate change ravages bear habitats, sending defenseless bears into the jaws of doom: human villages. But it might be in the way a story is framed. Like, there's a difference between bears move into human habitats and bears are forced into human habitats."
Language,"What causes them to move? Forced by whom or by what? Sometimes what's not in a text can be as important as what's in it. Experiment with this a little. Try summarizing some news articles and see if you can restate the facts of the stories without inserting any opinions. It's a fun challenge and it may expose an opinion where you didn't expect to see it. Objectively, you can learn anything. David out. Constant vigilance!."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"And as readers, we use those examples to grab hold of those ideas and better understand them. If I tell you that I have weird hobbies, I need to back up that statement with some examples. I need to illustrate just how weird they are. So if I say my hobbies include going for walks, reading books, and drinking tea, those are very ordinary interests, they're not weird at all. Not a good example. I need to be more selective and better support my claim that my hobbies are strange."
Language,"So instead, I could say my hobbies include puppeteering, making bubble tea from scratch, and learning to read Middle English. Well, now we're getting somewhere, right? Now you're starting to understand just how much of a weirdo this David guy is."
Language,"What is the function of an example? What does it do? When you come across an example, ask yourself, what purpose does this example serve? Why did the author introduce this detail here? How does this example connect to the text overall? Does it form a pattern with other details? And if so, what does that pattern tell me? And finally we ask ourselves, does this example raise other questions? Let's look at a text and evaluate its examples. Here's an excerpt from a piece about the author J.M."
Language,"Barrie, the creator of ""Peter Pan"". ""Barrie didn't have just one version ""of the ""Peter Pan"" story, ""he made changes along the way. ""For example, he learned ""that children were copying Peter Pan ""and trying to jump out of their beds to fly. ""Some of them were getting badly injured! ""So Barrie added the rule that in order to fly, ""you had to have fairy or pixie dust ""blown on you first. ""By adding this rule, ""J.M."
Language,"Barrie was trying to help children understand ""that flying is magical, ""so that they wouldn't try to do it themselves and get hurt."" So the author is saying that J.M. Barrie changed ""Peter Pan"" and then he gives an example of the change. Let's zero in on that example and ask those questions that we just went over. So for this example, what is its purpose? Well, it does a couple of things. It shows us that J.M. Barrie was willing to make changes to his story after it was initially published."
Language,"It shows us that the author wants to portray Barrie as a responsible person. He heard about children injuring themselves by copying his story and so he made an effort to prevent that by changing a detail in the story. It's also a pretty specific example that I can picture. I can imagine kids jumping off of tall things and getting hurt, and Barrie feeling worried about that. And because I can picture it, I can better understand it, which helps me better understand the overall text."
Language,"I only excerpted a small portion of this text. So I'm not gonna ask how it connects to the text overall. But this example does raise other questions for me, like what other children's fiction accidentally encourages people to do dangerous stunts at home? Like jumping off your bed? Examples are really powerful! They can shape a reader's impression of a topic. As a writer, employ them tactically to help develop someone's understanding."
Language,"Recognize that when a series of examples comes in sequence, it tells a story, and story is an incredibly powerful tool. Use it responsibly. As a reader, understand the power that examples have and pay attention to how they're being used. A well-chosen example or two can create a false narrative. As readers, we are engaged in a push and pull with writers, especially when they are trying to convince us of something. Make a writer work to convince you. Read with a skeptical attitude."
Language,"And if you can do that, you can learn anything. David, out.."
Language,"And sometimes that purpose will be harder to see. As readers, our job is to consider the author's purpose as we read. How is it influencing the information the author shares? How is it influencing my understanding of the topic? Is what I think the same as what the author thinks? Do I agree with them? Do I disagree? You may be familiar with the memory device of P.I.E., persuade, inform, entertain, as three categories of purpose. But I'd like to go deeper than that."
Language,"I live in Washington, D.C., which is home to an entire professional class of what are called lobbyists, people whose job it is to advocate to Congress on behalf of a special interest, for example, the oil industry or the cheese industry. This isn't always bad. You can learn more about lobbyists and advocates in Khan Academy's Government and Politics course. But frequently, it takes the form of someone from an industry trying to convince Congress to give them a competitive advantage over other industries."
Language,"Now, let's pull real-world politics out of this and pretend for the purposes of this lesson that there are two warring lobbying groups in D.C. One that represents the cake industry, and another that represents the pie industry. An age-old conflict. So hold that conflict in your mind for a second, cake versus pie. Now, when we read informational text, we should be learning new information. But the author's opinions can shape the text to the point where the information becomes biased or misleading."
Language,"When you read informational text, maintain an air of healthy skepticism. Ask yourself the following questions constantly. What's the author's opinion? What information did they include, or what information did they leave out? And if so, was that on purpose? What's the connotation of the author's word choice? You know, how do the words feel? And what's the overall tone of the piece? So now we have these questions to ask ourselves, let's return to our pie versus cake lobby fight in Washington."
Language,"So imagine you're reading ""The Washington Post,"" and you see this opinion column. ""Cake Connected to Cavities ""and Poor Dental Health, Study Finds."" ""A recent study by the American Dental Association ""connected the consumption of cake or similar foods ""with a 30% increased risk of tooth decay, ""cavities, and gingivitis. ""People who reported having consumed cake ""in the previous 60 days were significantly more likely ""to experience problems related to dental health ""than those people who did not."
Language,"""Cake is dangerous. ""Cake, which rarely contains fruit, will rot your teeth."" And then if we squint down at the very bottom of the column, it'll say in small text, ""The author is the CEO ""of Circular Solutions, a pie-advocacy network."" And now let's ask ourselves those same questions again while acknowledging that this is a fake story that I made up for the purposes of this video. There is nobody named Wendell Apricotjam, although I wish there were, that'd be a great name."
Language,"So, what's the author's opinion? Well, it seems to me that the author really thinks cake is dangerous and poses a threat to the nation's dental health. We know this because they literally say ""cake is dangerous."" They want people to buy and eat fewer cakes. What information did the author choose to include? Well, so this is interesting."
Language,"The author talks about the results of this study and the big takeaways about the danger of cake or similar foods, and then they go on to mention incidentally that cake rarely contains fruit. That's a curious thing to say. It's almost like they're saying, ""Pie, which has fruit in it, is better for you than cake,"" without actually saying it."
Language,"What information did the author choose to leave out? Well, notice that the piece says ""cake or similar foods."" I would be hard-pressed to come up with a definition of foods similar to cake that does not also include desserts like pie. But the way that this piece is written, it swerves out of its way to avoid pinning the same tooth decay risks on pie the way that it blames cake."
Language,"I think it would be reasonable to assume that if we read the underlying study that this opinion piece is based on, it would include pies and cakes in the same category of sugary desserts that are associated with bad dental outcomes. Why would the author do this? Well, they want you to buy pie instead of cake. But they don't want you to think too hard about it because if you did, you would buy and eat both less cake and less pie. And the pie lobby doesn't want that."
Language,"What's the connotation or the feeling of the author's word choices? Well, they're citing a scientific study by dentists, so they want you to take their warning seriously, and they're using words like risk and danger, rot and problems. They want you to make an association between eating cake and bad tooth health. They want you to associate scientific language with trustworthiness. So I'm gonna put down scientific authority here. What's the overall tone? It's negative."
Language,"The author does not want you to eat cake. They want you to think it's bad, and they've planted a little hint here that fruity foods are better. And what's a fruity food? Can they say pie is safer? No, not without lying outright. Now, I wanna be clear about two things. Sometimes an author's purpose really will just be to inform straightforwardly. Not everything has to be a tug-of-war between you and the author over the truth."
Language,"Sometimes a writer just wants you to know the lifecycle of a butterfly, or how to make egg salad, or the order the U.S. presidents came in. But most of the time, there's a purpose, an opinion, behind the text. Now, the second thing I wanna be super clear about is that I made up this whole thing. I made up the article, the statistics, Wendell, you know, all of that's fake. I like both pie and cake very much."
Language,"And now that I've said that, I'm sure you're wondering, ""Oh, is David in the pocket of big dessert?"" And the answer is no. I'm in the pocket of big free education for everyone everywhere. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"I don't literally mean that I've got a bear. That would be extremely sweet. Love a bear, love bear's whole thing with the snacking and the sleeping and the eating of fish, but no. A bear of is a figurative expression that means something difficult. So a bear of a lesson is a difficult lesson and that's what we're talking about today. Not bears, sorry, but non-literal uses of language, which we call figurative language or figures of speech. Figurative language says one thing but means another."
Language,"I could say that my colleague Allison is an eagle-eyed editor and when I say that I don't mean that she literally has an eagle's eyes in her head. That would be a terrifying achievement of medical science. No, I'm saying that she is sharp and attentive in the same way that an eagle is. So I'm saying something that is not literally true in order to express something that is true, that Allison is good at editing. Would you call that a lie? I'm not sure I would."
Language,"It's just a non-literal way of expressing myself. So, having gotten the question of whether or not I'm a dirty rotten liar out of the way, let's talk about some different varieties of figurative language. First, the simile. A simile is a comparison between two things that uses like or as. If I were really hungry, I could say that my stomach was gurgling like a tar pit or that I was as hungry as a ravenous wolf, and again, neither of these things are literally true."
Language,"If my stomach were making actual tar pit noises, I would probably need to go to a hospital. But what do those examples tell you about the way that I, the speaker, think about my hunger? Animals and people get stuck in tar pits, they're gloppy, they pull things into them, they slow things down. Sorry T-Rex. Therefore, I'm saying that my hunger is slowing me down. Or, if I'm comparing myself to a wolf, you can imagine me looking lean and desperate, saliva dripping from my jaws at the mere thought of food."
Language,"I could really go for a cheese danish come to think of it. So that's simile. The second figure of speech I wanna talk about today is the metaphor. And what's a metaphor? Cows and sheep! Sorry, I couldn't help it. No, a metaphor is not a meadow for. Metaphors are another way of comparing two things, but this time there's no like or as. We're walking this language tightrope without a net now."
Language,"You aren't signaling with like or as that you're making a figurative comparison, so you have to use context to communicate clearly. At the beginning of this video I said this was going to be a bear of a lesson. That's a metaphor. There's a Linda Ronstadt country song from the 70s, called ""Love is a Rose,"" which is all about how to take care of a relationship through the metaphor of tending a flower with thorns on it."
Language,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person."
Language,"To say that differently, it's ascribing human characteristics to non-living things. The wind howled through the mountains. The car grumbled as I threw it into gear. The storm raged. These are things that people do, but I'm applying that language to inanimate things, like wind and cars and storms in order to express the way these things are behaving. The car is not literally grumbling, ""Aw man, I can't believe David has to drive me today."" It's making noises that I am choosing to identify as unhappy."
Language,"The greatest kind of figurative language in the entire universe is hyperbole. By exaggerating, I'm expressing emphasis and importance. This summer, I'm going to read a million books and eat a literal actual ton of hot dogs. This is not true. In fact, this is impossible. That is too many hot dogs, those are too many books, each of which are sentences I never expected to say, but I'm trying to express my enthusiasm for both books and encased meats, and I'm doing that by being, you know, extra."
Language,"The final kind of expressive language I wanna talk about today isn't exactly figurative language, it's the language of allusions and references. Where you make comparisons to characters or events from literature, or movies, or culture. Also note that it's allusion with an A, as opposed to illusion with an I. An illusion with an I is like a magic trick. Here are some examples of allusions. Oh, you'd have to be Superman to lift that fallen tree. Or, you have a Gollum-like obsession with that stuffed animal."
Language,"Now these comparisons only work if the person you're talking to understands the reference. Superman has super strength, Gollum, from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" can't stop talking about how much he loves this one object, the ring. If you don't know the reference, then it's all just noise. One tip is to read up on mythology. You'd be surprised how many times ancient gods, like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo come up as you read. So that's what we're working with here. Simile, love is like a rose."
Language,"Metaphor, love is a rose. Personification, my car grumbled. Hyperbole, my mom grounded me for eight trillion years. And allusion, I feel mightier than Hercules. That's figurative language folks. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Once we've sussed out whose perspective a story or a poem is being told from, what's next? What else is there to talk about? Well, I think it's useful to remember that stories and poems don't just happen. They don't just suddenly, spontaneously exist. Creating them is work. And it's the result of a whole bunch of decisions made by a writer. So, who is the point-of-view character or characters? What does that mean for the story? Ultimately, a point of view is an author's decision."
Language,"So, when an author chooses to center a story on one character, how does that change the story they tell? Would the story be different if it were centered on a different character? How does that point of view impact the way the story gets told? Imagine a rocket scientist with a mouse in her pocket, and they're going to inspect a spaceship under construction."
Language,"I'm gonna give you two little snippets in what's called close third person perspective, where there's a narrator, but their point of view is attached to a character. We get to see through their eyes, experience their thoughts. So, first, we're gonna hear from the rocket scientist. ""Leaving the lab, Dr. Harper strode confidently ""into the spaceship hangar, ""clipboard in hand, pet mouse in pocket."
Language,"""Launch day was only eight months away, ""and Project Juno still had so many bugs to work out, ""but she was certain that the test she'd conduct today ""would help her solve the air filter problem. ""The starship sat before her in a pool of light, ""a deep bluish-black craft, ""once an idea that had lived only in her mind, ""but now it was a real physical object. ""She dug around in her pocket ""and fed Persephone a sunflower seed."" Now, let's take that again from the mouse's perspective. ""Persephone T."
Language,"Mouse ""clung to the lip of Tatiana's jacket pocket, ""as they passed from a small cold room ""into a much larger, warmer, and brighter room. ""It had been four hours since she'd had anything to eat, ""and she was cranky. ""In the middle of the big, bright room ""was a big bluish black shape. ""Persophone didn't know what it was, ""and frankly, it looked kind of like a bird, ""which was weird and a little frightening."
Language,"""But it hadn't moved ""the last time Persephone and Tatiana were in there, ""and it wasn't moving now. ""So, Persephone guessed it was asleep. ""She chirped impatiently, ""and Tatiana gave her a sunflower seed."" You see, the same things happen in each story. Dr. Harper goes from her lab to the spaceship hangar, and then, she feeds her pet mouse a sunflower seed. But when we hang out with Harper's perspective, we get her thoughts and we see what she thinks is important."
Language,"But when we're reading from Persephone the mouse's perspective, she doesn't care about the spaceship, she doesn't know what it is. As readers, it's useful to ask how a writer is developing a character's point of view through a story. What are the abilities and limitations of a point-of-view character? Persephone the mouse is small. She can sneak through little holes in the wall or hide in the jacket pocket of a consenting human being. But Dr."
Language,"Harper has, you know, an astrophysics doctorate and opposable thumbs. She can open doors, design a spaceship, plan its flight trajectory. This is kind of an extreme example because one of these characters is a human being and the other one is a mouse. But even among different people, we can imagine very different stories. Characters and stories are just like real people. They have strengths and weaknesses, knowledge about some things and ignorance about others."
Language,"Sometimes, they tell the truth, and sometimes, they lie. This is especially important in first-person books, where everything we read comes to us directly from the point-of-view character. You have to open yourself up to the possibility that the narrator can be wrong about stuff. They can perceive things incorrectly, or be blinded by their own assumptions, or just be confused. They could also just be lying. But they could also just be innocently wrong and confused."
Language,They could look at a spaceship and think it's a bird. Narrators that are wrong or misinformed or actively trying to trick you are called unreliable narrators. Reading a book narrated by an unreliable narrator turns the relatively straightforward process of reading into a tug of war.
Language,"How do I know I can trust what the narrator is telling me? Ask yourself, what does a narrator think? What do they feel and what do they do? When you can answer all of those questions, you can begin to put their perspective into words. If you can identify the biases or the perspective or the ignorance of a point-of-view character, you can start to correct for it as you read, and use that understanding of the point of view to better understand the story as a whole."
Language,"Something important to remember is that the storytelling character is not the same thing as the author. The author creates those characters and is literally the person who writes the words. But if I wrote a story about an ogre who eats children, that does not make me an ogre who eats children. I would never eat children. They taste horrible. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"You'll notice it has almost no words in it, at least in this form. Now, let me show you the script. Pages three and four, panel one. A double-page spread, the whole greenhouse revealed, in widescreen. It's glorious. Wisps of steam curl up from bubbling patches of pool, green kelpy tendrils twine up the sides of the building. Everything is suffused with a delicate, green glow. Absent the gro-lights, some of the algae fluoresce in a range of cool-spectrum colors. But primarily greens."
Language,"Eugene is dwarfed by its almost cosmic magnificence. Caption, I can't describe it. None of that language, except for the caption, shows up in the final layout. All of that was me, the writer, giving art direction to Cour, the illustrator. Then they translated that language into their own version. I think it's a pretty faithful translation. My words are translated through Cour's design sensibilities and turned into artwork."
Language,"When you translate a written work into a different medium, whether it's illustrated, animated, recorded, or performed live it changes. It becomes a fundamentally different object. As readers, it's a valuable skill to explore how a text changes as it shifts from one medium to another. And when I say, medium, I mean a style of work, like a stage play, a film, a graphic novel, and audio drama, any of that. Good readers analyze those changes and use them to understand decisions that creators make."
Language,"If you're watching Romeo and Juliet and the director has made the decision to dress everyone in towering robot suits, a detail that is definitely not in the play as written, what does that decision tell you? What does it mean to you? Maybe you have had the experience of reading a book series that was important to you and then they made it into a movie and you were so excited to see the movie, and you sat down to see it and it was awful."
Language,"Like, they cast the wrong actors and they simplified the plot until it made no sense, and it just didn't feel right. That feeling is an example of this tension, this change, between a written material and its visual adaptation. Sometimes it can be bad, sometimes it can be good. Some readers can imagine what characters in books look or sound like, hearing them in their mind's ear, seeing them in their mind's eye."
Language,"The way your imagination renders a character is going to be different from how someone else's imagination does it. So let's compare the script for this audio drama we've got on Khan Academy, Hands Off My Phone, and let's compare that against the recorded version. So first, I'm going to put up the script and I'd like you to pause the video and just read it to yourself very quickly. And now let's take a listen to the recorded version. (upbeat music) (bell ringing) - [Sebastian] Oh no he didn't."
Language,"That is so harsh. - [Valentina] Right? - [Sebastian] Your dad took your phone away, just for getting a D on the history test? - [Valentina] Yep. - [Sebastian] My mind is blown. - [Valentina] Mine too. - [Sebastian] I mean, that was an easy test. - [Valentina] What? - [Sebastian] I can't believe you got a D. - [Valentina] Hey! That's not really-- - [Sebastian] And your dad is the school principal, and he took your phone away. Whoa. (chuckling) - [Valentina] You know, this isn't really helping."
Language,"- [Sebastian] Your life is so bleak right now. -    So you can read that script and think, oh hey, Sebastian is being earnestly sympathetic. Like, he really recognizes that his friend is hurting, but when you hear that performance the way I interpreted this line is that Sebastian is low-key roasting Valentina. He's not saying your life is so bleak in a kind way. He's rubbing salt into the wounds and being a dingus about it."
Language,"There's also other stuff that's not explicitly in the script like, that opening musical sting. (upbeat music) And the ringing of the bell. (bell ringing) Or those background school noises. All of that is meant to represent the fact that you're listening to a fictional show that takes place in a school setting. Does it work? That's for you to decide. When you watch or listen to a performance or a recording, or when you look at illustrations, ask yourself some questions."
Language,"For an audio piece, how do the sound effects, the acting decisions, and the music impact the story or affect the meaning of the words the characters say? How does the way an actor delivers a line change its emphasis? Was someone being sarcastic or sincere in a way you didn't expect, for example? For an illustrated story, how do those illustrations help you understand the author's tone and do you agree with those choices? Is the author's interpretation of the story the same as yours? For a TV show, or a movie, or a play, in addition to all the decisions made by actors about how to use their voices, shape their faces, or hold their bodies, how does the set tell the story? How do costumes tell the story? How does lighting or special effects impact the tone? For TV and film, how does the camera impact the way the story is told? The way a piece of film text is edited, its cuts, its angles, its rhythms, can help shape the way you, as a viewer, as a reader of visual text, understand it."
Language,"And if you can learn that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"At the time of this recording, I'm 31 and I run into new and confusing words every day. I read a lot and it's always a fun challenge to run into words like, I don't know, glabrous or limned or nacreous. I know a lot about language and even I have trouble figuring out what those words mean on their own. So it's important to rely on context, the language that surrounds the word. Let's say you're reading a text and you come across a sentence that has a word in it you don't recognize."
Language,"Here's a bit from a passage about the famous chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. ""Jane Goodall arrived at Tanzania's ""Gombee Stream National Park in 1960. ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers. ""After all, she had not yet been to college."" So let's pause on unconventional. What does that word mean? Well, let me give you some ideas, that's the memory aid I use to keep it straight."
Language,"IDEAS, it stands for inference, definition, example, antonym, synonym, I-D-E-A-S, IDEAS, which are all different kinds of context clues. Every word will have a different context, so you might need to vary your approach. The way this snippet is written let's try inference first, then I'll rewrite the sentence a few times to show you the other methods. Okay, the I in IDEAS, inference. We can draw conclusions from the context."
Language,"If we don't know what unconventional means, we can take a look at the rest of the sentence or other nearby sentences to figure it out. Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal."
Language,"And because I'm making an inference about this word's meaning I wanna keep an eye out for it in other places to see if I can confirm or revise that working definition later. D - definition. Context clues like these will just give you the definition of the word in question. So a good example of that would be: ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers."
Language,"""She hadn't been to college yet, ""and this made her different and unexpected."" Different and unexpected is a great definition for the word unconventional. This style of context clue occurs when the author expects a word to be unfamiliar to you and builds in a guide for you right there in the text. The E in IDEAS stands for example, and this is somewhere between inference and definition. If the author describes Goodall as unconventional, they'll go on to talk about something unconventional that Goodall did."
Language,"""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among animal researchers. ""For one thing, she hadn't been to college yet."" So this is very similar to that initial sentence, except for the transition phrase for one thing, which is a way to set up examples. Antonym - an antonym is a word whose meaning is the opposite of another word, like how night is the opposite of day, or how love is the opposite of hate."
Language,"So if there's an example in the text of what Jane Goodall was not, we can use that to figure out what she was. So let's say the passage said: ""Goodall was unconventional. ""She didn't conform, and she wasn't ordinary."" There we have two antonyms and our answer. Similarly, synonym just means write another word with the same meaning similar to a definition. ""Jane Goodall was unconventional. ""She was a nonconformist."
Language,"""She went against the grain."" You can see that I had to rewrite the sentences each time to apply to each context clue strategy, which shows me that you won't find all five context clues every time you need to search for a word's meaning. You need to find the approach that makes the most sense in context. See what I did there, ah huh? And failing that, you can always look up an unfamiliar word in a dictionary. I love to do that."
Language,"I think that's great, but I also feel a sense of victory when I correctly figure out what a new word means, when I've put it together from context. And maybe if I'm still curious, I look it up later and then I turn out to be right, and I'm all like ""Victory at sea, I did it!"" Oh, and if you were curious, glabrous means smooth and hairless like a leaf or the skin of a frog. Nacreous means shiny and rainbow colored like the inside of an oyster shell."
Language,"And to limn something means to draw the outline of or to be highlighted in light. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word. This is distinct from denotation, which is more like the dictionary definition of a word. Companion and buddy both have similar denotations. They both mean friend, but companion is a much more formal sounding word than buddy. Which originated as a piece of slang from the 19th century."
Language,"So even though their denotation or their literal definition is the same, they feel different. The connotation of companion is formal while the connotation of buddy is friendly and casual. Good readers pay close attention to the words the author chose to use. They picked those words for a reason. How do those words make you feel? What is the author trying to imply? How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"using details from a text to make inferences, aren't you? - [Sherlock Bones] Yes, my boy! It's simplicity itself. But first, let me deduce a few things about you, shall I? -    Well, Mr. Bones, we're trying to do this about writing, not about people, so... - [Bones] Give me your hand. -    Waugh! - [Bones] Ah, you like to cook, you have a nervous disposition and you work for Khan Academy."
Language,"-    Now how did you know that? - [Bones] You have a callus on your finger from how you hold a knife, your fingernails are bitten, not clipped and your messenger bag says Khan Academy. -    Well and I told you who I was before I showed up. - [Bones] That too. -    But what does this have to do with reading a book? - [Bones] I correctly deduced several truths about your person based on clues, my good David. Indeed, all inference is making sense of clues."
Language,"When you read a story, you are constantly making inferences. -    I see. Okay, I'll read a passage and then see what I can make of it. An hour later, thick smoke poured up the stairs. The smoke detector screamed and I could hear Uncle Paleo stumbling around with the fire extinguisher. When he came upstairs afterward, his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. He was a wreck, broken glasses, black smudges on his face and singed hair."
Language,"Okay, so I can surmise that there was some kind of fire or explosion downstairs, where the character Uncle Paleo was. - [Bones] Hm, how do you know? -    Well his hair was singed, that's another word for burned and his face was covered in black smudges like you get from soot from a fire and there was all the smoke and the smoke detector went off. - [Bones] And there is also the matter of the fire extinguisher. -    Also that. - [Bones] I see something else in that passage too."
Language,"-    What's that, Mr. Bones? - [Bones] Uncle Paleo was exhausted by putting out the fire. -    How can you tell? Where does it say that? - [Bones] Well, it doesn't. That's inference, my lad. Note here how it said his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. Why might that be? -    He stepped in something sticky. No, oo, he's wearing shoes made of lead. - [Bones] Well, those are indeed possible explanations but you want to think of the most likely option."
Language,"-    He was running around to put the fire out and it made him tired. - [Bones] So, you were reading between the lines, were you? Drawing conclusions from the text? -    I was. So we know for sure Uncle Paleo was tired, right? - [Bones] WE DO NOT, SIR. -    Oh!! - [Bones] An inference is only one possible conclusion but is not the only conclusion. -    So what are we to do? - [Bones] The more clues you discover, the stronger your inferences will become."
Language,"You have to look at what you already know about a character, about the setting of the story, the events of a story's plot and piece it together from there. You know that fires create lots of black dust or soot so it strengthens your argument in favor of a fire. And it's background knowledge like that, about the way the world works that will serve you as a reader and as a maker of inferences. Apply what you know to the world of the story and make inferences based on that."
Language,"-    And then, I can become the world's greatest consulting detective? - [Bones] You can become like the world's 50th greatest consulting detective, top of the heap's rather full, I'm afraid. -    Well, thank you for your time today, Mr. Bones. Best of luck with your case work. - [Bones] Thank you; I shan't need it. (barks) -    You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"When you read, or when you interact with any kind of fiction, watch carefully for how characters change over time."
Language,"How do characters in a text interact with each other? Does the way a character react to events change over the course of the story? What's changed and why? One of my favorite pieces of fiction of all time is ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" and while he isn't the main character, I think the character of Prince Zuko has one of the best illustrations of character change across the course of the show."
Language,"So spoilers ahoy! But Zuko goes from being an antagonist in the first few seasons, to officially joining the protagonists, the good guys, in the final season of the show. I appreciate how the creators of the show map Zuko's growth and change, because we can see him unlearning old, bad habits and taking on new, more productive ways of behaving as the show progresses."
Language,"He fundamentally changes as a person, and it's the result of a lot of hard work on his part and a lot of love and patience from the people who care about him. Zuko is what is called a dynamic character, which is to say that he changes throughout the story. This is the opposite of a static character, who does not change."
Language,"There's a running gag in the ""Avatar"" series about this one hapless cabbage merchant who keeps on showing up in various cities only to have the protagonists knock his cabbage cart over again and again. Pretty much the only thing he says in the course of the whole show is his catchphrase, ""My cabbages!"" He doesn't learn, he doesn't grow, he only suffers. Cabbage guy, static character, Zuko, dynamic character."
Language,"Many main characters are dynamic, but secondary and background characters, like the cabbage guy are static. So what causes character change in stories? Other people and events. Let's take a look at an example from our website, ""Oscar's Musical Odyssey."" Oscar begins the story by telling his friends on the soccer team that he can't hang out with them that night, he's gotta go to the symphony with his parents."
Language,"His teammates mock him and he feels bad: Oscar was hesitant to say it out loud, as he knew exactly what would happen when his friends found out where he was going. ""I have to go to the symphony tonight,"" he said quietly. The water in Kevin's mouth exploded into the air, propelled by the laughter that closely followed. ""The symphony, hey fellas,"" Kevin exclaimed, as his voice rose to address everyone within ear shot."
Language,"""Guess where El Capitan Rico over here is going? ""He's gonna go sip tea and listen to the symphony!"" Instantly the other soccer guys joined in mocking Oscar. ""I didn't know you had a thing for old gringo music,"" laughed Lorenzo. ""What's next, bro,"" shouted Juan, ""watching the evening news in your bathrobe?"" ""What kind of soccer player goes to the symphony?"" said Javier. Oscar sighed. He knew this would happen."
Language,"although he loved the camaraderie he had with the guys on the soccer team, the amount of grief he was going to get over a stupid night out with his parents was going to be rough, very rough. While Oscar almost always felt tight with this group, this was stirring up some feelings of isolation within him. So this is how Oscar reacts. He's hesitant, he's embarrassed because of how his friends feel about his symphony plans. They're not even his plans, his parents are making him go."
Language,"Good readers ask themselves how do characters treat each other? Oscar's friends think listening to classical music is something for old white dudes or fancy tea-drinking nerds, but whatever it is, it's definitely not for soccer players. But then Oscar attends the symphony and he is bewitched by what he hears. The experience changes him."
Language,"So we can ask how do events change how characters behave? Well, let's return to the text: On the way home Oscar's mom said, ""I know this wasn't what you would have chosen for tonight, ""but I hope you enjoyed it."" ""I thought it was great,"" said Oscar, ""I had no idea, I was so wrapped up in what the guys ""were saying about me that I didn't give it a chance. ""I bet they would love this music,"" he said. ""Maybe,"" said his dad, ""but if they don't, does it matter?"" And that's when Oscar understood something."
Language,"His whole identity didn't have to be defined by only one or two things. Who he was could be a mix, in interwoven harmony of many things. We can look to the text to provide evidence of Oscar's change. He has this moment of clarity in the car after the symphony. He realizes he doesn't have to be either a soccer player or a guy who enjoys symphonies, he can be both at once."
Language,"So when you're evaluating a character, ask yourself for specific choices that characters make, dialogue exchanges, or interactions with other characters, or responses to story events. Compare similar events at different points of the story. Does a character react in the same way at the story's beginning versus how they might react in the middle or near the end of it? If no, what's changed and why? If you can answer those questions, congratulations! You've identified the dynamic character."
Language,You can learn anything. David out. My cabbages!.
Language,"What, your saying, how do you map a story? What makes a story pointy? These are great questions, and to answer them, I'll say this, today we're going to talk about the elements of a story, or the parts that make it up, like ingredients in a recipe. Many stories follow a similar pattern. Good readers know what these patterns are, and can talk about them using the right terms. And this helps everyone be on the same page, so to speak, when you discuss or write about the stories you read."
Language,"I'm about to drop a lot of vocabulary on you, so brace yourselves. The story begins with exposition, where we learn about the characters and the setting. Then, we introduce a conflict, or a big problem. As the characters begin to interact with the conflict or try to solve the problem, we enter rising action. This upward slope of the story mountain. When the conflict comes to a head, we hit the most exciting part of the story, the climax. Here, the conflict can't go any further."
Language,"We're at the top of the mountain. There's nowhere else to go, except down. After the climax, after this most exciting part of the story, we enter falling action. The climax will happen much closer to the end of the story than to the middle. It's not a symmetrical mountain. The action slows down. The problem has been solved, or maybe the problem has changed, and the characters prepare for the last phase of story, the resolution."
Language,"This is where we tie up loose ends, characters reflect on what they learned, maybe you set up a sequel. Now, look, that was a lot of information all at once. In order to make sense of it, let's apply all of those terms to a story."
Language,"Now, our go-to has been the Three Little Pigs, and while that's a story everyone knows, I'm starting to think it needs to be freshened up a little bit, really working its franchise potential, you know? So let's go through the elements of story by looking at my new project, a reboot of Three Little Pigs that I'm calling TLP: Starbound. See, it's Three Little Pigs, but it's in space. That's a space helmet. So I'm gonna put a little story map here in the corner. Okay, so the exposition. It's the future."
Language,"Pigs have expanded to every corner of the galaxy. Three brave little pigs decide to strike out on their own, exploring a new, exciting region of space. One builds a spaceship out of straw. Go with me here. One builds a spaceship out of twigs. And one builds a spaceship out of flexible hyper alloy they developed in a laboratory. She's the brainy pig. So, we've got the setting. It's the future, they're in space. We've got our characters, the pigs. Now, the conflict."
Language,"Along comes the notorious space pirate, Captain Wolf. He's big, he's bad, he wants to blow up the spaceships and eat the pigs. He begins hunting down the pig ships, one at a time. Think Captain Wolf has an eye patch? No, he has a cyber eye; he's part robot. And now we enter our rising action phase. Captain Wolf engages the straw ship. They have an exciting space battle. (instructor making shooting noises) And straw pig escapes in the little escape pod to the twig ship! But Captain Wolf follows."
Language,"He is undaunted. The tension continues to rise. He destroys the twig ship! (instructor making shooting noises) The two pigs escape again, this time to the brick house. I mean, the flexible hyper alloy spaceship, piloted by the science pig. And now, we come to the climax. Captain Wolf comes to the advanced ship. He tries to blow it up, but he can't! It's too powerful. He decides to board the ship, because that's the only way he'll get to eat the pigs."
Language,"But the pigs trap him in a space barrel while he's still in the airlock. They did it! They solved the problem. Captain Wolf is trapped in a space barrel, and he can't eat them now. The climax is passed, and now we enter the falling action phase of the story. In the version of the story that I know, the three little pigs roll the barrel in to the river."
Language,"So I think maybe in this version they punt the space barrel out the airlock in to the cold void of space! Or maybe they strand him on a deserted planet, but in any case, they never have to deal with the wolf again. The threat is now gone. And that means that the conflict has been resolved. We're in the resolution part of the story now. The first two little pigs, the straw ship pig and the twig ship pig, learned that they need to put more work in to their spaceships if they wanna survive in space."
Language,"And they build fancy spaceships just like the science pig. And that's an introduction to story elements. Now that you're familiar with the ideas, start applying them to your favorite stories. You can do this with any form of media: books, comics, TV shows, movies, games. What's the conflict? How is it resolved? Once you start looking for story structure in entertainment, you will find it everywhere. Let us now what you see. You can learn anything; David, out.."
Language,"Drama, also known as theater or plays, is a specialized kind of story that is meant to be performed. If you've ever seen a movie, a television show or a play, or if you've ever heard a play on the radio or through a podcast, you've experienced the magic of the dramatic arts. Writing a drama is different than writing a poem or story. And that means that reading one is different, too. So I'm gonna show you part of a short drama on the Khan Academy website in order to go through the parts of a play."
Language,"Okay, so here we have the title of the piece, My Unusual Aunt. But it's followed by something you maybe haven't seen before which is the Cast of Characters. This tells us who's in the play, a 12 year old named Isabella, and her aunt Yasmin. Now these are the characters the actors will be performing in the drama. There may be other people referenced. Like for example in this piece Isabella refers to her Dad being asleep in Scene Two. But he never shows up on stage."
Language,"A play is decided into scenes, which you can think of like chapters in a book. Scenes are sections of a drama that are separated by time or location. Scene One takes place in the evening outside. Scene Two takes place at Isabella's house some time later. How do we know that? The setting and stage directions. So this italic slanty text here in the brackets tells us where the scene is set in time and space. It says Evening: Isabella is walking her dog Stanley. A bat dives down."
Language,"The name Isabella is in all capital letters to make sure the actor playing Isabella notices. And from this we know several things. Isabella is in this scene, she's outside, she's walking her dog, and it's nighttime. So if this were a stage play, we'd maybe see a set that looks like Isabella's neighborhood. She's walking the dogs, maybe we'd see a little bit of sidewalk or a fire hydrant. There's more italics in this bit, and it what are called stage directions."
Language,"An actor wouldn't read this aloud during a performance. Instead, stage directions tell the team putting a drama together what is happening on stage. So a bat dives down. That's gonna be a puppet or a prop operated by a puppeteer or a stage hand. And then we have this line of dialogue spoken by Isabella reacting to the bat. Ugh, since when do we have bats in the neighborhood? C'mon Stanley, let's run home. So characters have lines. The character name indicates which character is speaking."
Language,"Sometimes you'll have a stage direction just before a line of dialogue, as we can see in Scene Two. And Yasmin points to a giant trunk before she talks, but the actor playing her wouldn't say pointing at giant trunk aloud. That's a physical action the script is asking her to perform. These are the basic components of a stage play."
Language,"The characters and their descriptions, the way the play is divided into scenes, the stage directions that tell actors and others what to do, and the lines of dialogue that actors have to deliver aloud. These are the building blocks of a play. And now that you know that, you know just enough to be dangerous. Go write a play! Tell it I sent you. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"(tense big band music) Friday was a very straightforward, almost relentless, character and the catchphrase associated with his character was ""Just the facts."" ""All we want are the facts, ma'am,"" was the sort of thing that he would say. And that's what we're talking about today: just the facts. There's this idea called objectivity. That you can talk about something without inserting any opinions which are personal thoughts or beliefs."
Language,"Doing this, being objective, is very difficult; opinions want to creep in. So what does it mean for a summary to be objective? It means it isn't influenced by feelings or opinions, it's not written in the first person, it's about the text, not me, and it's not a judgment or a review of the information. Let's be clear here; it's not bad to have opinions. In my opinion, it is good to have opinions, but they do not have a place in summaries. You can put opinions to use when you analyze or evaluate something."
Language,"When you're looking at summaries and you're trying to determine whether one is objective or not, look for words that cast judgment. Does the writer say something is good or terrible or useful or useless? Let's do this together. I'll take this text and summarize it without any opinions. Polar bears hunt for seals on thick sea ice in the Arctic. As the Earth grows warmer, though, sea ice gets thinner."
Language,"With less stable ground, some hungry polar bears search for food inland, often dangerously close to human environments. Although polar bears usually keep to themselves, a very scared or angry one could attack, and even eat, a human. Several villages have set up polar bear patrols as a result. The patrollers zoom around on snowmobiles, using bright lights and loud noises to scare away polar bears. Hopefully, the polar bears find another snack later on."
Language,"Here's my summary: Climate change causes polar bears to encroach on human habitats to search for food. As a consequence, these villages have set up polar bear patrols to frighten them away. As a person who cares about climate change, as well as the wellbeing of bears and human beings, I have all sorts of opinions about this, but for the purposes of summarizing that paragraph, I have to put them aside. Just the facts, ma'am."
Language,"(Dragnet theme) If you get good enough at making objective summaries, you'll start noticing when opinion creeps into things you expect to be objective. And it won't be obvious like bears are terrible and humans are right to scare them away or climate change ravages bear habitats, sending defenseless bears into the jaws of doom: human villages. But it might be in the way a story is framed. Like, there's a difference between bears move into human habitats and bears are forced into human habitats."
Language,"What causes them to move? Forced by whom or by what? Sometimes what's not in a text can be as important as what's in it. Experiment with this a little. Try summarizing some news articles and see if you can restate the facts of the stories without inserting any opinions. It's a fun challenge and it may expose an opinion where you didn't expect to see it. Objectively, you can learn anything. David out. Constant vigilance!."
Language,"It is a giant robot made up of five smaller robots, each one piloted by a person. Five friends, each with control over a different part of the robot's body. You're up in the head, I'm operating the right leg, our buddy's operating the left, and so on. In order to walk or pick up objects or fight space monsters the size of battleships, all the disparate of the robot have to function together. Well, texts work much the same way."
Language,"Each portion of the text, from the section level down to more granular divisions like individual paragraphs or sentences, is trying to serve the broader point of the text. When we look at Voltron's foot in motion, we analyze what the foot is doing in the service of Voltron as a whole."
Language,"If Voltron's foot kicks a ball, we have to zoom out to ask, is Voltron playing soccer? This is a pretty abstract idea without any text examples, so let's stop talking about space robots and start talking about the Armor of 10th-century Japanese horse archers. All right, so this whole passage is about the armor worn by mounted archer samurai of 10th-century Japan, o-yoroi, and how it's constructed. So this is a piece of o-yoroi armor. This is the whole assemblage."
Language,"And that's how the piece is divided, right? We've got the sections here for each component. The cuirass, the o-sode or shoulder guards, the kusazuri, or armored skirt, and the kabuto, the helmet. And each one of these elements of the armor connects back to the whole point of the piece, which is describing how the armor does two things. One, it protects the wearer, and two, allows them to ride horses and fire arrows. Now we see this in the introductory paragraph."
Language,"Their armor, called o-yoroi, was designed specifically to withstand the demands of mounted archer warfare. So let's dig into this first section about the cuirass, the breastplate and backplate armor. I'll read the first paragraph. ""A cuirass is usually a piece of armor ""that consists of a breastplate and a backplate ""that are attached together. ""The cuirass for the o-yoroi was a bit different ""than a typical cuirass, ""as it was designed to be more effective for an archer."
Language,"""The o-yoroi cuirass had three sections instead of two. ""A section to protect the back, ""a section to protect the chest, ""and a section to protect the left side body. ""The right side was left open ""so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow."" So this paragraph is describing what a cuirass is and how it functions as armor, but then it goes into detailing how an o-yoroi cuirass is different because it's for someone holding a bow, right? It has three sections instead of two."
Language,"The right side was left open so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow. This information down to the sentence level all serves the same purpose. It serves to answer the question, how was o-yoroi armor specifically designed to meet the needs of a mounted archer? Not every sentence or every paragraph will address every part of that main question. Note that the cuirass section doesn't cover anything about how the archers are on horseback."
Language,"To answer that question, we need to go down to the third section, the kusazuri, the battle skirt. I'm not gonna read the whole paragraph. Let's just zoom in on this one sentence. ""The kusazuri were designed so that when the warrior ""was sitting in his horse's saddle, ""they fit nicely over the saddle in a skirtlike fashion ""to protect his lower body and upper legs."" This particular sentence tells us how this part of the armor protects the samurai's legs while they're on horseback."
Language,The paragraph and section it's part of detail the whole construction of that part of the armor and how it relates to the other pieces. And all of those paragraphs together form one text that explained the thing it set out to explain. What is o-yoroi and how does it work for 10th-century horse archer samurai? Each section or paragraph is like a leg or an arm of Voltron. Each sentence is a muscle or a finger or a robo-toe.
Language,"Together, moving as one, they tell a story or make an argument, which I guess is like Voltron winning a fight, maybe. I feel like I've carried this metaphor as far as it'll go. The point is, if you're having trouble making sense of an informational text, think of it as a giant battle robot. What is each of component part of the text trying to accomplish? And when you put all those parts together, what are they trying to do? Well, my work here is done. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"And sometimes that purpose will be harder to see. As readers, our job is to consider the author's purpose as we read. How is it influencing the information the author shares? How is it influencing my understanding of the topic? Is what I think the same as what the author thinks? Do I agree with them? Do I disagree? You may be familiar with the memory device of P.I.E., persuade, inform, entertain, as three categories of purpose. But I'd like to go deeper than that."
Language,"I live in Washington, D.C., which is home to an entire professional class of what are called lobbyists, people whose job it is to advocate to Congress on behalf of a special interest, for example, the oil industry or the cheese industry. This isn't always bad. You can learn more about lobbyists and advocates in Khan Academy's Government and Politics course. But frequently, it takes the form of someone from an industry trying to convince Congress to give them a competitive advantage over other industries."
Language,"Now, let's pull real-world politics out of this and pretend for the purposes of this lesson that there are two warring lobbying groups in D.C. One that represents the cake industry, and another that represents the pie industry. An age-old conflict. So hold that conflict in your mind for a second, cake versus pie. Now, when we read informational text, we should be learning new information. But the author's opinions can shape the text to the point where the information becomes biased or misleading."
Language,"When you read informational text, maintain an air of healthy skepticism. Ask yourself the following questions constantly. What's the author's opinion? What information did they include, or what information did they leave out? And if so, was that on purpose? What's the connotation of the author's word choice? You know, how do the words feel? And what's the overall tone of the piece? So now we have these questions to ask ourselves, let's return to our pie versus cake lobby fight in Washington."
Language,"So imagine you're reading ""The Washington Post,"" and you see this opinion column. ""Cake Connected to Cavities ""and Poor Dental Health, Study Finds."" ""A recent study by the American Dental Association ""connected the consumption of cake or similar foods ""with a 30% increased risk of tooth decay, ""cavities, and gingivitis. ""People who reported having consumed cake ""in the previous 60 days were significantly more likely ""to experience problems related to dental health ""than those people who did not."
Language,"""Cake is dangerous. ""Cake, which rarely contains fruit, will rot your teeth."" And then if we squint down at the very bottom of the column, it'll say in small text, ""The author is the CEO ""of Circular Solutions, a pie-advocacy network."" And now let's ask ourselves those same questions again while acknowledging that this is a fake story that I made up for the purposes of this video. There is nobody named Wendell Apricotjam, although I wish there were, that'd be a great name."
Language,"So, what's the author's opinion? Well, it seems to me that the author really thinks cake is dangerous and poses a threat to the nation's dental health. We know this because they literally say ""cake is dangerous."" They want people to buy and eat fewer cakes. What information did the author choose to include? Well, so this is interesting."
Language,"The author talks about the results of this study and the big takeaways about the danger of cake or similar foods, and then they go on to mention incidentally that cake rarely contains fruit. That's a curious thing to say. It's almost like they're saying, ""Pie, which has fruit in it, is better for you than cake,"" without actually saying it."
Language,"What information did the author choose to leave out? Well, notice that the piece says ""cake or similar foods."" I would be hard-pressed to come up with a definition of foods similar to cake that does not also include desserts like pie. But the way that this piece is written, it swerves out of its way to avoid pinning the same tooth decay risks on pie the way that it blames cake."
Language,"I think it would be reasonable to assume that if we read the underlying study that this opinion piece is based on, it would include pies and cakes in the same category of sugary desserts that are associated with bad dental outcomes. Why would the author do this? Well, they want you to buy pie instead of cake. But they don't want you to think too hard about it because if you did, you would buy and eat both less cake and less pie. And the pie lobby doesn't want that."
Language,"What's the connotation or the feeling of the author's word choices? Well, they're citing a scientific study by dentists, so they want you to take their warning seriously, and they're using words like risk and danger, rot and problems. They want you to make an association between eating cake and bad tooth health. They want you to associate scientific language with trustworthiness. So I'm gonna put down scientific authority here. What's the overall tone? It's negative."
Language,"The author does not want you to eat cake. They want you to think it's bad, and they've planted a little hint here that fruity foods are better. And what's a fruity food? Can they say pie is safer? No, not without lying outright. Now, I wanna be clear about two things. Sometimes an author's purpose really will just be to inform straightforwardly. Not everything has to be a tug-of-war between you and the author over the truth."
Language,"Sometimes a writer just wants you to know the lifecycle of a butterfly, or how to make egg salad, or the order the U.S. presidents came in. But most of the time, there's a purpose, an opinion, behind the text. Now, the second thing I wanna be super clear about is that I made up this whole thing. I made up the article, the statistics, Wendell, you know, all of that's fake. I like both pie and cake very much."
Language,"And now that I've said that, I'm sure you're wondering, ""Oh, is David in the pocket of big dessert?"" And the answer is no. I'm in the pocket of big free education for everyone everywhere. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"""This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why."" Argument does not sneak, it does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories: data, fact, observable reality. There is a place for pure subjective opinion, and it is the realm of the movie and the restaurant review."
Language,"""I did not like this movie because I didn't laugh at its jokes."" ""I did not enjoy the hamburger I got because I found it too dry for my liking."" This is not what we're talking about today. Obviously, argument is rooted in opinion and subjective personal preferences, but those opinions need to be backed up with evidence. Let's compare arguments for and against a tax on soda."
Language,"Now, this writer argues that sugar contributes to obesity, and therefore, people should be prevented from buying soda, which is full of sugar on the grounds that it is bad for them, let's take a look. The soda tax could alter many people's behavior, causing them to stop buying sugary drinks. Some foods are necessities like milk, eggs, and bread. People will buy them even if the prices increase. Sugary drinks aren't necessary."
Language,"If the price goes up, people will buy fewer sugary drinks and they won't be consuming as much sugar, therefore, the obesity rate will go down. Whereas this author counters that people have a right to make what they see as unhealthy decisions. Soda and other sugary drinks have been targeted because they lack nutrition and are basically just liquid sugar. Most people would agree that proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
Language,"However, do legislators have the right or responsibility to regulate people's sugar intake in order to improve their health? I say, no. All right, let's evaluate these claims. For the first argument in favor of the soda tax, how do we know this is true? What evidence does this author give that this tax will alter people's behavior? What evidence does this author give that sugary drinks aren't seen to be as essential as milk? After all, not everyone can or does drink milk."
Language,"In the piece, the evidence that the author gives us is this table, which shows how much sugar is in soda per serving, but it doesn't use evidence to connect sugar consumption to unhealthy outcomes. All this says is, soda has a lot of sugar. I wanna see evidence, I wanna see studies. How do we know this tax would change behavior? Good readers think through the impacts of an argument."
Language,"If this tax went into effect, what would the consequences be? Are there faults in the author's logic? It might stop some people from buying soda, but in an unfair way. Here's how I'm processing this as a reader. If you take a bottle of soda that previously costs, say $2, and the tax makes it $10, that will make it more difficult to purchase. But to a millionaire, the difference between $2 and $10 is basically nothing. Whereas to a poor or middle class person, that $8 difference adds up pretty quickly."
Language,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary."
Language,"So now I'm asking, whose responsibility is it to determine how much sugar is in a drink? Why is sugar so inexpensive to begin with? Do legislators have a responsibility there? Now we know it's not legal to bottle rat poison and sell it as tea, but whose responsibility is that? What isn't this author saying, and how does not saying it serve their argument? They're not saying what the government could or should do, only what it shouldn't do."
Language,"And this is why I want you to be skeptical whenever you read anyone's argument about anything. You need to figure out what the terms of the debate are. What does the argument assume as a given? What's a problem worth fixing? What are the trade offs that the writer thinks are acceptable? So when you encounter an argument in text, look for the claims, and then look to see if those claims are backed up with data-supported reasoning."
Language,"Is the author using evidence and logic? Do they anticipate objections to their arguments and push back on or incorporate those critiques? Above all else, I want you to remain skeptical. Everyone's selling something, even me. It's just the thing I'm trying to sell you is the fundamental idea that you can learn anything. You've got this, Readers. David out.."
Language,"How do we know that though? How did J. R. R. Tolkien, as an author, develop that theme in the text? How can we go deeper, beyond that headline of the Ring equals the dangers of absolute power? Good readers can look at a whole text from beginning to end and identify where the author purposefully chose words, included details, or directed action that develops or reveals the overall theme."
Language,"It's not just that characters say, ""Oh, no, the Ring's super-dangerous."" In fact, I believe in ""The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf says, ""No, with that power, ""I should have power too great and terrible. ""And over me, the Ring could gain a power ""still greater and more deadly. ""Do not tempt me!"" The characters say that, they do, but it's also about how they behave around the thing."
Language,"It's how the plot is shaped around this object and how a group of people come together to identify this Ring as a dangerous, magical artifact that needs to be destroyed for the good of the world. It's not just dialogue. It's also descriptions by the author and actions taken by the characters."
Language,"So let's go through some of the ways that an author can develop theme within a story, with the important caveat that you won't always be able to detect a theme in a text until you're already finished reading it for the first time. This, to me, is one of the great pleasures of rereading. You've already worked hard to get an understanding of the text, so now you can go back and pick up all the stuff you might not have noticed the first time."
Language,"So one way to develop theme is through the repeated use of a symbol or an object. The Ring in ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great example because characters are always talking about it. But it could really be anything, a design, an object, an animal. Imagine a story about a child who wants to grow up to be an engineer that develops airplanes. And throughout this story, birds keep showing up, birds on the protagonist's windowsill, her favorite teacher's bird earrings, maybe she has a best friend named Robin."
Language,"And from that, we can see the idea of flight is a theme in this story, and all of these bird-related things go back to this character's desire to take flight. Changes in setting are a fine way to develop themes. How is a location portrayed? How does it match with the way characters feel or behave when they appear in these locations? Imagine a character who desperately wants to be alone. So at a tense portion in the story, she flees to a distant mountaintop."
Language,"When she gets there, what's the weather like? Is it cold, snowy, and forbidding on the mountain? Is it an active volcano, bubbling with lava? Is it clear, peaceful, full of snowdrops and mountain goats? What would an author be trying to say with those decisions? How should we, the reader, feel about that character's solitude? If it's snowy and forbidding, is it a symbol of the character's coldness, of their hardening up? Does the volcano reflect the character's explosive potential? Or does the beauty of the lonely mountaintop mean this was the right decision for the character to take? Dialogue that repeatedly references a similar idea can be a way to develop theme."
Language,"When characters mention something a lot, it's probably because the author is thinking about it and maybe wanted to build it intentionally into the story. Imagine a teenager in Ancient Rome who's preoccupied with honor and his family name and how he's worried he won't live up to the achievements of his ancestors. If that's something that he's insecure about, he might think about it often or talk about the concept of honor or the social standing of his family."
Language,"You can also see this presented as explicit lessons by a sage character, usually older and wise. Think of Moana's grandmother or of Yoda. They'll say something explicit like, ""Go do the thing your heart wants, Moana,"" or, ""Trust that the energy of the universe ""will make you a really good space wizard, Luke."" I'm paraphrasing here. Or think of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" saying, ""There's no place like home."" She says it again and again. The words are so powerful that they're used as a magic spell."
Language,"And words so powerful that they become magic is really just another way to say theme. It doesn't need to be said aloud to be thematic. Some of the most powerful moments in storytelling come from action, not just dialogue. Momentous character decisions, like Maui giving up his powers to save Moana or Harry Potter's climactic battle with Voldemort, are chock-full of themes, self-sacrifice, the power of love, the importance of honesty. Some of these themes can be expressed without speaking a single word."
Language,"And I should be clear. Sometimes you need to finish the story before you can look back on it and understand how parts of it contribute to the theme. You might need to get some distance before you can see how all of the pieces fit together. If something really sticks with me, sometimes I like to go back and reread parts of a book once I've gotten a sense of its theme, to see how the author has threaded theme through the text."
Language,"Now, if you look very closely at the videos I make here at Khan Academy, if you really squint your eyes and listen carefully, you'll notice that all of them share the same theme, which is you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"If ordinary writing is like talking, then poetry is like singing. Poetry is a way of making art with language. Poems can express huge ideas or feelings. They can be about the sound or rhythm of language, or they can be goofy, little jokes. It's like any other kind of writing. Poems can be about everything or they can be about nothing at all. They can be funny, or sad, or sweet. They can rhyme. They can very much not rhyme. And all of that is, in my opinion, absolutely wonderful."
Language,"I think of some poems as condensed ideas that contain a lot of ideas in small amounts of text. So every word matters a lot. There's a little light bulbs representing ideas. So I'm gonna look at a couple of poems today in order to describe some parts of a poem. Let's begin with the poem ""Cat"" by Marilyn Singer. It goes like this. I prefer warm fur, a perfect fire to lie beside a cozy lap, where I can nap, an empty chair when she's not there. I want heat on my feet, on my nose, on my hide."
Language,"No cat I remember dislikes December inside. So the person who wrote this poem, Marilyn singer, is the poet for stories. The person who writes the poem is an author, but for poems, the writer is a poet, but who is telling the poem? Who's speaking? The person whose voice we hear in a poem is called the speaker, which is another thing I like about poetry. When you're having trouble understanding a poem, read it aloud. Part of the pleasure of poetry for me is hearing the words bounce around as you say them."
Language,"And then this poem, I'm pretty sure the speaker is a cat. Now you'll notice there are only three sentences in this poem, but they're separated into 15 lines. You can see these lines have anywhere from one to four words in them. Lines can be as long or as short as a poet likes, but here the poet is creating these line breaks to indicate pauses and rhythms, right? Like normally we wouldn't start a new line here, if this were prose, which is what we call all other forms of writing."
Language,"Prose uses normal sentences and paragraphs, right? The poet is choosing to create line breaks in order to change the way the sentence or the line looks on the page. Poetry is not just about how it sounds. Sometimes it's about how it looks as it's written. Now, in addition, the poet is also using spaces to scoot these three phrases over as well as this word inside. The words themselves are scooted in. They're curled up and feeling cozy, like a cat by a fire in the middle of December."
Language,"You'll also notice that some but not all of the lines rhyme with each other. And let's take a moment to think for a second. What is rhyming really? One way to think about it is when the ending sound of a word matches the other ending sound of a word like lap and nap, or when a bunch of sounds match each other throughout a pair of words like remember, and December, I want to be super clear about this part because I was already out of high school before I learned this thing, but poems don't have to rhyme."
Language,"They can, but they definitely don't have to. I have one more poem part to describe to you. And to do it, I wanna use Billy Collins poem ""Litany"" which sounds like a fancy poem at first, but then becomes much more conversational. I'll end by reading the first three stanzas, which are these paragraph looking things. Not all poems are broken into stanzas, but this one is. So those are some parts of the poem. To review, a poet writes lines."
Language,"The place where each line ends is called a line break and a group of lines together in a paragraph is called a stanza. The voice that tells us the poem, the poem's narrator is called the speaker. Some poems rhyme, others don't. Here's a snippet of ""Litany"" by Billy Collins. Litany. You are the bread and the knife, the crystal goblet and the wine. You are the dew on the morning grass and the burning wheel of the sun. You are the white apron of the baker and the marsh birds suddenly in flight."
Language,"However, you are not the wind in the orchard, the plums on the counter, or the house of cards. And you are certainly not the pine scented air. There is just no way that you are the pine-scented air. It is possible that you are the fish under the bridge. Maybe even the pigeon on the General's head, but you are not even close to being the field of corn flowers at dusk. There's more, but I'd love it if you looked it up and read it aloud yourself. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Tone communicates how an author feels about the topic they're writing about, this can come across in a number of different ways, it can reflect their enthusiasm or skepticism, it can also communicate formality or informality, an academic paper or a speech before the UN, for example are very different things from a toast at a wedding or a thank you card for a birthday gift and this kind of difference in tone is something that sociologists and linguists call register."
Language,"Social conventions and customs call for different registers in different circumstances, just as it would be inappropriate in most situations to wear a tuxedo at the beach, so too would it be incongruous to use extremely formal language in an informal setting? (melodic orchestral music) (clearing throat) Dear honored sir, it was the privilege of my very life to have you attend my 14th birthday party. I am grateful beyond words for your most generous gift, a check for $36 American."
Language,"Your humble and obedient servant, David. In fact using extremely formal language and high-minded gratitude for something as relatively small as a birthday gift might even come across as sarcastic or insulting. But this is sort of an extreme example, let's pull back and discuss how an understanding of tone can aid you in making sense of informational texts."
Language,"One great way to do that is to analyze word choice, we can look at a writer's language and determine their attitude towards the subject based on the words they've chosen to describe it. Oceans of ink have been spilled over comparisons between a Chicago style hotdog and a New York style hotdog. The first with its garden's worth of toppings, but a holier than now prohibition of ketchup, the latter with its sauerkraut, mustard and dubious dirty water cooking style."
Language,"But scant attention, a droplet of ink before the ocean has been paid to the half-smoke, the unsung but mighty regional sausage of Washington DC. Now how does the author think about the subject? Well, we know that they think that not enough writing has been done about DC's regional sausage, the half-smoke, but how do they feel about it? How do the words they use express their feelings? Let's break it down bit by bit."
Language,"So right out of the gate, we have oceans of ink, this is a deliberate piece of overstatement, there are no literal oceans made of ink, but it's being set up in opposition to the droplet of ink used to describe half-smokes later in the paragraph."
Language,"Half-smokes are described as unsung, but mighty, which suggests that they haven't been given their due, there hasn't been enough praise for half-smokes and that therefore the amount of attention given to Chicago and New York hotdogs is unfair or even disproportionate. I think we can also determine from word choice, that the author thinks a Chicago hot dog is a little ridiculous and that a New York hot dog is a little gross."
Language,"How do we know this? Chicagoans generally don't like ketchup on their hotdogs and the way the author phrases this is by saying, that they have a holier than thou prohibition on ketchup, which is to say they get all haughty and upset about it, which is weird because it's ketchup, listen, I'm a Chicagoan by birth, I used to feel this way and I'm not even sure why."
Language,"Similarly the word dubious in the description of the New York hotdog, meaning doubtful suggests that the dirty water cooking method is kind of nasty sounding, why would the author do this? Is it to say these are terrible hot dogs and nobody should eat them? No, I don't think so, The author is trying to make room for the half-smoke in the national sausage conversation and to do that, they're first trying to dismantle the importance of New York and Chicago style by making fun of them."
Language,"These are tactical choices, not to be confused with authorial voice, which is a different concept entirely an author's voice is their style, it's much more consistent across topics, whereas a tone is specific to a topic. So I might have an authorial voice, that uses a lot of goofy wordplay, but I use a sympathetic tone to talk about bears and a hostile tone to talk about, I don't know, whales, yeah, boo whales, I said it. I do not actually hate whales, I love whales."
Language,"But my point is this, use your knowledge of words, of the connotation and implications of the language, that an author might use to unlock your understanding of their tone, because if you can do that, my friend, you can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"So science fiction is a genre, fairy tales are a genre, mysteries are a genre. Each one of these types of stories has certain elements that you gradually come to expect from them. Fantasy stories have magic spells and imaginary creatures. Romance stories have lots of smooching. Mystery stories have a crime and a person who tries to solve it. You can call these tropes, you can call these style elements but certain genres have certain expectations embedded in them."
Language,"The more you read of a genre, the more your expectations are shaped for that genre. When a story begins with the phrase, ""Once upon a time,"" and ends with ""and they lived happily ever after,"" you know you're looking at a fairy tale. We all carry with us a unique collection of impressions and expectations. It's your background knowledge, your schema. If you think of your brain as a closet, then schema is the hooks and clothes hangers inside that closet."
Language,"You can put a new shirt on a clothes hanger, you can hang pants or a skirt on a clothes hanger, but if you wanted to hang up a dress, you might need one of those fabric-covered hangers so it doesn't slip. And if you wanna store shoes in your closet, you might need to get a shoe rack or one of those hanging shoe organizers."
Language,"Just as different clothing items require different, you know, closet infrastructure like hangers or shoe racks, your schema, your background knowledge, informs the sort of literature you know how to read. That's a weird sentiment to express, I think, but it's true. The first time you read a book in a particular genre, you're forming an impression of that genre. And that impression gets refined or revised with every similar book you read after the first."
Language,"Reading widely across many genres of fiction expands your brain closet. But let's be clear here. Not every book is connected with every other book. And when you try to apply something you learned in one story to another story, it may not work. For example, in 20th century detective fiction, there is a recurring theme or trope that dates to the 1930s: the butler did it, which is to say that if there's a murder that takes place at a fancy manor house, there's a good chance that the butler is the murderer."
Language,"But if you go into every mystery set at a fancy manor house assuming that the butler is the guilty party, you'll be wrong a lot. Famously, in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, everyone did it. Every suspect in the mystery is responsible in some way for the murder in the title."
Language,"It's an enormous conspiracy, and Christie plays with the readers' assumptions as we go through the story, knowing that you, as a person who has probably read a mystery before, or who is at least familiar with the form, has an expectation that there are only one or two culprits, only one or two people that did the murder to the guy on the train."
Language,"And look, I apologize for spoilers for a story from 1934, but you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs, you know what I mean? Anyway, it's neat to look at the way that an author can play with the expectations of genre, how an author might anticipate a reader's schema and play with that. Something that blew my mind when I was in school was the idea that Star Wars was a western, or at least takes many of its cues from classic pulp western movies. Let's draw a little Venn diagram."
Language,"All right, so over here, we've got Star Wars and over here we've got the western movie genre. Here are some things that Star Wars has that westerns don't have. Space wizards like the Jedi and Sith, magic like the force, or space ships. Here's some things that western movies have that Star Wars movie's don't, by and large, have. Western movies have horses, they tend to have cowboys, and then tend to take place in settings like the western United States and Mexico."
Language,"But here's our overlap, all right, so both Star Wars and western movies have bar fights, both Star Wars and western movies have bounty hunters, and both the Star Wars films and western films tend to have a lot of desert settings. That could be the desert planet of Tatooine from Star Wars, or Monument Valley in the US state of Texas, or the Mexican state of Durango in western films."
Language,"Mind you, you could also make a separate Venn diagram between Star Wars and samurai movies because Star Wars also borrows liberally from those. This is a great activity for analysis. Take two stories that you love and compare their theme, settings, and characters, and see if there's something you can find in common between them. You may discover connections you didn't expect. As I've mentioned before, good readers read widely."
Language,"They read lots of books and they let what they know about one genre, their schema of the genre, help them anticipate and make connections when they read a new book. The more you read, the more schema you build, the easier and more interesting those connections will become. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"At the time of this recording, I'm 31 and I run into new and confusing words every day. I read a lot and it's always a fun challenge to run into words like, I don't know, glabrous or limned or nacreous. I know a lot about language and even I have trouble figuring out what those words mean on their own. So it's important to rely on context, the language that surrounds the word. Let's say you're reading a text and you come across a sentence that has a word in it you don't recognize."
Language,"Here's a bit from a passage about the famous chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. ""Jane Goodall arrived at Tanzania's ""Gombee Stream National Park in 1960. ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers. ""After all, she had not yet been to college."" So let's pause on unconventional. What does that word mean? Well, let me give you some ideas, that's the memory aid I use to keep it straight."
Language,"IDEAS, it stands for inference, definition, example, antonym, synonym, I-D-E-A-S, IDEAS, which are all different kinds of context clues. Every word will have a different context, so you might need to vary your approach. The way this snippet is written let's try inference first, then I'll rewrite the sentence a few times to show you the other methods. Okay, the I in IDEAS, inference. We can draw conclusions from the context."
Language,"If we don't know what unconventional means, we can take a look at the rest of the sentence or other nearby sentences to figure it out. Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal."
Language,"And because I'm making an inference about this word's meaning I wanna keep an eye out for it in other places to see if I can confirm or revise that working definition later. D - definition. Context clues like these will just give you the definition of the word in question. So a good example of that would be: ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers."
Language,"""She hadn't been to college yet, ""and this made her different and unexpected."" Different and unexpected is a great definition for the word unconventional. This style of context clue occurs when the author expects a word to be unfamiliar to you and builds in a guide for you right there in the text. The E in IDEAS stands for example, and this is somewhere between inference and definition. If the author describes Goodall as unconventional, they'll go on to talk about something unconventional that Goodall did."
Language,"""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among animal researchers. ""For one thing, she hadn't been to college yet."" So this is very similar to that initial sentence, except for the transition phrase for one thing, which is a way to set up examples. Antonym - an antonym is a word whose meaning is the opposite of another word, like how night is the opposite of day, or how love is the opposite of hate."
Language,"So if there's an example in the text of what Jane Goodall was not, we can use that to figure out what she was. So let's say the passage said: ""Goodall was unconventional. ""She didn't conform, and she wasn't ordinary."" There we have two antonyms and our answer. Similarly, synonym just means write another word with the same meaning similar to a definition. ""Jane Goodall was unconventional. ""She was a nonconformist."
Language,"""She went against the grain."" You can see that I had to rewrite the sentences each time to apply to each context clue strategy, which shows me that you won't find all five context clues every time you need to search for a word's meaning. You need to find the approach that makes the most sense in context. See what I did there, ah huh? And failing that, you can always look up an unfamiliar word in a dictionary. I love to do that."
Language,"I think that's great, but I also feel a sense of victory when I correctly figure out what a new word means, when I've put it together from context. And maybe if I'm still curious, I look it up later and then I turn out to be right, and I'm all like ""Victory at sea, I did it!"" Oh, and if you were curious, glabrous means smooth and hairless like a leaf or the skin of a frog. Nacreous means shiny and rainbow colored like the inside of an oyster shell."
Language,"And to limn something means to draw the outline of or to be highlighted in light. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I'm not gonna say that you need to be able to speak modern Greek or read ancient Latin in order to understand English but many complicated words are made up of little language building blocks that we can break apart, using the power of understanding! (explosion) That was cool right? I'm cool? I'm cool. I'm gonna introduce some vocabulary about vocabulary now, so brace yourselves. There's this idea of a root word. Take the word dent, which is Latin for tooth."
Language,"From that root word, we can get the adjective dental, which means about teeth, or the noun dentist, which means a person who specializes in teeth, or the noun dentures, which are false teeth. That's what a root is. Now you can also combine roots to make words. The word phot is Greek for light, the root graph comes from the Greek for writing. You put those together, you get photograph or writing with light. It's kind of poetic, isn't it? To this understanding, let us add the idea of an affix."
Language,"Affixes aren't words or roots but they are word particles that convey meaning. Maybe you've heard of prefixes and suffixes, if you have, these are both types of affixes. Prefixes attach at the front end of a word, whereas suffixes attach at the back end. An example of a suffix would be logy, meaning the study of or the science of."
Language,"So we can make a bunch of words with logy, like biology, that's supposed to be a little amoeba; cetology, the study or science of whales; anthropology, the study of human beings; cosmology, the study of the universe. So if you see a logy, it's going to be some kind of science or specialized area of study. A good example of a prefix would be the Greek para, which means alongside."
Language,"So a paralegal is someone who works alongside lawyers, a paramedic works alongside doctors and if your house is haunted, you don't need a normal pest control expert to get rid of the ghost, you need a paranormal pest control expert, one that is alongside but not within normalcy and thus, you call the Ghostbusters. So what does all of this mean for you as a reader? Well when I encounter a word I don't understand, it's like I had been walking down a hallway and was suddenly confronted with a locked door."
Language,"It's frustrating but the magic, the power of studying roots, prefixes and suffixes is that when you master a small handful of them, you suddenly become the proud owner of a ring of keys. Doors fling themselves open for you, you can go anywhere, you can understand any concept, any piece of vocabulary. An army of locked doors fall off their hinges all at once when you approach. Don't believe me? I'll show you. While excavating the foundation for a geothermal plant, my companion Neha found a fossil."
Language,"Upon closer inspection, she realized it was a pterodactyl. Wow, lot of big words in that little paragraph. Now, watch this. Excavating, so hollowing out. Foundation, bottom-making. Geothermal, Earth heat. Companion, so this is someone you would eat bread with, so bread together, who do we eat bread together with? Our friends. Inspection, looking in or closer and pterodactyl, pter means wing, dactyl means finger, it is a prehistoric winged reptile."
Language,"So while she was digging in the ground to prepare the bottom of a plant that gets electricity from the heat of the Earth, my friend Neha found a fossil. When she looked at it closely, she realized it was a flying reptile with fingery wings. Do you see what I mean about keys? Studying roots and affixes gives me the power to look at those words and crack them apart. You're not so big now, vocabulary word. You have no power over me! Studying roots, prefixes and suffixes will give you that same power."
Language,"I promise you it is awesome, like, literally it fills me with a sense of awe. The power is yours for the taking. You can learn anything, David out. Okay are we doing those fun history reasons though? Okay, the short version is that first the Romans then some Vikings, then some French Vikings invaded the island of Great Britain a bunch of times over the last 1500 years, shaping the language and making what I like to call French-shaped dents in the Germanic structure of English."
Language,"English is a Germanic language, French is a Romance language, meaning not that it is full of love but that it is an offshoot of Latin or you know, Roman. French took root in 11th Century English and merged with it, grafting an enormous amount of Greek and Latin vocabulary on to a German root stock. We often reach for Latin and Greek compounds when we compose new words, which is why we say television in English, which comes from the Greek tele, meaning far away, and the Latin vire, meaning to see."
Language,"If we reached for Germanic roots to make new words, we'd call a television a farseer because indeed, that's what the word is in German, fernsehen. So why do we have Greek and Latin in our vocabulary? Because England was colonized by French speakers almost a thousand years ago. Imagine what English will sound like in another thousand years. Anyway, thanks for coming on this tangent with me. David out for real this time, bye.."
Language,"I don't literally mean that I've got a bear. That would be extremely sweet. Love a bear, love bear's whole thing with the snacking and the sleeping and the eating of fish, but no. A bear of is a figurative expression that means something difficult. So a bear of a lesson is a difficult lesson and that's what we're talking about today. Not bears, sorry, but non-literal uses of language, which we call figurative language or figures of speech. Figurative language says one thing but means another."
Language,"I could say that my colleague Allison is an eagle-eyed editor and when I say that I don't mean that she literally has an eagle's eyes in her head. That would be a terrifying achievement of medical science. No, I'm saying that she is sharp and attentive in the same way that an eagle is. So I'm saying something that is not literally true in order to express something that is true, that Allison is good at editing. Would you call that a lie? I'm not sure I would."
Language,"It's just a non-literal way of expressing myself. So, having gotten the question of whether or not I'm a dirty rotten liar out of the way, let's talk about some different varieties of figurative language. First, the simile. A simile is a comparison between two things that uses like or as. If I were really hungry, I could say that my stomach was gurgling like a tar pit or that I was as hungry as a ravenous wolf, and again, neither of these things are literally true."
Language,"If my stomach were making actual tar pit noises, I would probably need to go to a hospital. But what do those examples tell you about the way that I, the speaker, think about my hunger? Animals and people get stuck in tar pits, they're gloppy, they pull things into them, they slow things down. Sorry T-Rex. Therefore, I'm saying that my hunger is slowing me down. Or, if I'm comparing myself to a wolf, you can imagine me looking lean and desperate, saliva dripping from my jaws at the mere thought of food."
Language,"I could really go for a cheese danish come to think of it. So that's simile. The second figure of speech I wanna talk about today is the metaphor. And what's a metaphor? Cows and sheep! Sorry, I couldn't help it. No, a metaphor is not a meadow for. Metaphors are another way of comparing two things, but this time there's no like or as. We're walking this language tightrope without a net now."
Language,"You aren't signaling with like or as that you're making a figurative comparison, so you have to use context to communicate clearly. At the beginning of this video I said this was going to be a bear of a lesson. That's a metaphor. There's a Linda Ronstadt country song from the 70s, called ""Love is a Rose,"" which is all about how to take care of a relationship through the metaphor of tending a flower with thorns on it."
Language,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person."
Language,"To say that differently, it's ascribing human characteristics to non-living things. The wind howled through the mountains. The car grumbled as I threw it into gear. The storm raged. These are things that people do, but I'm applying that language to inanimate things, like wind and cars and storms in order to express the way these things are behaving. The car is not literally grumbling, ""Aw man, I can't believe David has to drive me today."" It's making noises that I am choosing to identify as unhappy."
Language,"The greatest kind of figurative language in the entire universe is hyperbole. By exaggerating, I'm expressing emphasis and importance. This summer, I'm going to read a million books and eat a literal actual ton of hot dogs. This is not true. In fact, this is impossible. That is too many hot dogs, those are too many books, each of which are sentences I never expected to say, but I'm trying to express my enthusiasm for both books and encased meats, and I'm doing that by being, you know, extra."
Language,"The final kind of expressive language I wanna talk about today isn't exactly figurative language, it's the language of allusions and references. Where you make comparisons to characters or events from literature, or movies, or culture. Also note that it's allusion with an A, as opposed to illusion with an I. An illusion with an I is like a magic trick. Here are some examples of allusions. Oh, you'd have to be Superman to lift that fallen tree. Or, you have a Gollum-like obsession with that stuffed animal."
Language,"Now these comparisons only work if the person you're talking to understands the reference. Superman has super strength, Gollum, from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" can't stop talking about how much he loves this one object, the ring. If you don't know the reference, then it's all just noise. One tip is to read up on mythology. You'd be surprised how many times ancient gods, like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo come up as you read. So that's what we're working with here. Simile, love is like a rose."
Language,"Metaphor, love is a rose. Personification, my car grumbled. Hyperbole, my mom grounded me for eight trillion years. And allusion, I feel mightier than Hercules. That's figurative language folks. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word. This is distinct from denotation, which is more like the dictionary definition of a word. Companion and buddy both have similar denotations. They both mean friend, but companion is a much more formal sounding word than buddy. Which originated as a piece of slang from the 19th century."
Language,"So even though their denotation or their literal definition is the same, they feel different. The connotation of companion is formal while the connotation of buddy is friendly and casual. Good readers pay close attention to the words the author chose to use. They picked those words for a reason. How do those words make you feel? What is the author trying to imply? How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"And as readers, we use those examples to grab hold of those ideas and better understand them. If I tell you that I have weird hobbies, I need to back up that statement with some examples. I need to illustrate just how weird they are. So if I say my hobbies include going for walks, reading books, and drinking tea, those are very ordinary interests, they're not weird at all. Not a good example. I need to be more selective and better support my claim that my hobbies are strange."
Language,"So instead, I could say my hobbies include puppeteering, making bubble tea from scratch, and learning to read Middle English. Well, now we're getting somewhere, right? Now you're starting to understand just how much of a weirdo this David guy is."
Language,"What is the function of an example? What does it do? When you come across an example, ask yourself, what purpose does this example serve? Why did the author introduce this detail here? How does this example connect to the text overall? Does it form a pattern with other details? And if so, what does that pattern tell me? And finally we ask ourselves, does this example raise other questions? Let's look at a text and evaluate its examples. Here's an excerpt from a piece about the author J.M."
Language,"Barrie, the creator of ""Peter Pan"". ""Barrie didn't have just one version ""of the ""Peter Pan"" story, ""he made changes along the way. ""For example, he learned ""that children were copying Peter Pan ""and trying to jump out of their beds to fly. ""Some of them were getting badly injured! ""So Barrie added the rule that in order to fly, ""you had to have fairy or pixie dust ""blown on you first. ""By adding this rule, ""J.M."
Language,"Barrie was trying to help children understand ""that flying is magical, ""so that they wouldn't try to do it themselves and get hurt."" So the author is saying that J.M. Barrie changed ""Peter Pan"" and then he gives an example of the change. Let's zero in on that example and ask those questions that we just went over. So for this example, what is its purpose? Well, it does a couple of things. It shows us that J.M. Barrie was willing to make changes to his story after it was initially published."
Language,"It shows us that the author wants to portray Barrie as a responsible person. He heard about children injuring themselves by copying his story and so he made an effort to prevent that by changing a detail in the story. It's also a pretty specific example that I can picture. I can imagine kids jumping off of tall things and getting hurt, and Barrie feeling worried about that. And because I can picture it, I can better understand it, which helps me better understand the overall text."
Language,"I only excerpted a small portion of this text. So I'm not gonna ask how it connects to the text overall. But this example does raise other questions for me, like what other children's fiction accidentally encourages people to do dangerous stunts at home? Like jumping off your bed? Examples are really powerful! They can shape a reader's impression of a topic. As a writer, employ them tactically to help develop someone's understanding."
Language,"Recognize that when a series of examples comes in sequence, it tells a story, and story is an incredibly powerful tool. Use it responsibly. As a reader, understand the power that examples have and pay attention to how they're being used. A well-chosen example or two can create a false narrative. As readers, we are engaged in a push and pull with writers, especially when they are trying to convince us of something. Make a writer work to convince you. Read with a skeptical attitude."
Language,"And if you can do that, you can learn anything. David, out.."
Language,"I legitimately wrote a book about this a few years ago, and to research this book about the world's deadliest animals, I read a lot of other books and sources. So I wanna use this experience to show you why it's important to read more than one source on a subject. Okay, so why do it? Why not say all right, I read one text about the Pacific Blue-ringed octopus. Why do I need to read two or three or 20? There are a couple reasons. Let's start with the first, expert knowledge."
Language,"If you wanna know all about octopuses, you can't just look at a single piece of writing say, ""Bam, got it, know all I need to know ""I am the knower of octopus facts."" No, you can't do it. If you want to become an expert, you need to be able to say well, this book says the Pacific octopus toxin can stop your heart. But this one says that you can tell whether or not an octopus is frightened by its color. Reason number two to read multiple sources, helping to determine or know what's true."
Language,"Sometimes people get things wrong. It helps to read more than one text to make sure you're getting as many perspectives or ideas as you can. Sometimes information from an old book might be outdated or information from a new book hasn't yet been proven to be true. Reading different texts can help you decide what you think about a topic, or even whether or not something is true."
Language,"We can answer questions like, what is the deadliest animal? Or how do we even define deadliest? Reason number three, to read multiple texts on the same topic, supporting an argument. The more information you can get about a topic, the more support you can give to your own opinions or arguments. I think that this animal is the most dangerous because I've read a bunch of different works about dangerous animals and I can support it with evidence, you would say."
Language,"If I were to say that bears are more dangerous than I don't really know what I drew, I thought I was trying to draw a sheep but I think it's a hedgehog. If I were to try to argue that bears are more dangerous than hedgehogs, I would use multiple sources to provide evidence for those claims. Bears are taller, bears are heavier, bears have sharper teeth, bears are stronger. Hedgehogs or sheep are cuter and cuddlier sorry to bears."
Language,"It's important to recognize that different books have different arguments in them. Every book has a different angle, right? Sometimes it's obvious like a book with the title, ""Deadly animals and how to hunt them"" versus a book called ""Deadly animals and how to protect their habitats."" People have opinions and people make books. So, that means that books can have opinions too."
Language,"Are these animals cool or terrifying? Should they be hunted or protected? Reading one text on a subject doesn't give you the full story. It's important to be able to read more than one text, compare them and then decide what you think from that. It helps to have a purpose in mind too as you read. Oh, and to answer your unspoken question, the deadliest animals on earth are definitely human beings but in a close second place is hippos. Those guys will bite you in half. So you know, watch out for hippos."
Language,You can learn anything. David out..
Language,"It is a giant robot made up of five smaller robots, each one piloted by a person. Five friends, each with control over a different part of the robot's body. You're up in the head, I'm operating the right leg, our buddy's operating the left, and so on. In order to walk or pick up objects or fight space monsters the size of battleships, all the disparate of the robot have to function together. Well, texts work much the same way."
Language,"Each portion of the text, from the section level down to more granular divisions like individual paragraphs or sentences, is trying to serve the broader point of the text. When we look at Voltron's foot in motion, we analyze what the foot is doing in the service of Voltron as a whole."
Language,"If Voltron's foot kicks a ball, we have to zoom out to ask, is Voltron playing soccer? This is a pretty abstract idea without any text examples, so let's stop talking about space robots and start talking about the Armor of 10th-century Japanese horse archers. All right, so this whole passage is about the armor worn by mounted archer samurai of 10th-century Japan, o-yoroi, and how it's constructed. So this is a piece of o-yoroi armor. This is the whole assemblage."
Language,"And that's how the piece is divided, right? We've got the sections here for each component. The cuirass, the o-sode or shoulder guards, the kusazuri, or armored skirt, and the kabuto, the helmet. And each one of these elements of the armor connects back to the whole point of the piece, which is describing how the armor does two things. One, it protects the wearer, and two, allows them to ride horses and fire arrows. Now we see this in the introductory paragraph."
Language,"Their armor, called o-yoroi, was designed specifically to withstand the demands of mounted archer warfare. So let's dig into this first section about the cuirass, the breastplate and backplate armor. I'll read the first paragraph. ""A cuirass is usually a piece of armor ""that consists of a breastplate and a backplate ""that are attached together. ""The cuirass for the o-yoroi was a bit different ""than a typical cuirass, ""as it was designed to be more effective for an archer."
Language,"""The o-yoroi cuirass had three sections instead of two. ""A section to protect the back, ""a section to protect the chest, ""and a section to protect the left side body. ""The right side was left open ""so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow."" So this paragraph is describing what a cuirass is and how it functions as armor, but then it goes into detailing how an o-yoroi cuirass is different because it's for someone holding a bow, right? It has three sections instead of two."
Language,"The right side was left open so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow. This information down to the sentence level all serves the same purpose. It serves to answer the question, how was o-yoroi armor specifically designed to meet the needs of a mounted archer? Not every sentence or every paragraph will address every part of that main question. Note that the cuirass section doesn't cover anything about how the archers are on horseback."
Language,"To answer that question, we need to go down to the third section, the kusazuri, the battle skirt. I'm not gonna read the whole paragraph. Let's just zoom in on this one sentence. ""The kusazuri were designed so that when the warrior ""was sitting in his horse's saddle, ""they fit nicely over the saddle in a skirtlike fashion ""to protect his lower body and upper legs."" This particular sentence tells us how this part of the armor protects the samurai's legs while they're on horseback."
Language,The paragraph and section it's part of detail the whole construction of that part of the armor and how it relates to the other pieces. And all of those paragraphs together form one text that explained the thing it set out to explain. What is o-yoroi and how does it work for 10th-century horse archer samurai? Each section or paragraph is like a leg or an arm of Voltron. Each sentence is a muscle or a finger or a robo-toe.
Language,"Together, moving as one, they tell a story or make an argument, which I guess is like Voltron winning a fight, maybe. I feel like I've carried this metaphor as far as it'll go. The point is, if you're having trouble making sense of an informational text, think of it as a giant battle robot. What is each of component part of the text trying to accomplish? And when you put all those parts together, what are they trying to do? Well, my work here is done. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Hey, what's up readers? David here. I'm taking advantage of the cold that I have by doing my serious detective voice in order to teach you about inferences. (phone ringing) Hold on, let me get that. Hi, this is David. I'm in the middle of doing a video. Now isn't a great time. - [Man On Phone] Hello, I have information about what an inference is. -    Oh, oh that's great. Cool, follow me over to the next screen."
Language,"What is an inference, please? - [Man On Phone] An inference is a conclusion that you make based on clues given in a piece of writing. It's more than a guess, but it's not just an observation either. -    Great, thank you. Was that all you needed? - [Man On Phone] Yeah, that was my only thing. -    All right, thanks, bye. - [Man On Phone] Goodbye. -    So an inference is a conclusion that you draw from writing."
Language,"It's an idea that you pull from a sentence or a passage that isn't literally printed there. It's the detective work of reading, finding clues that help you make sense of what's being said. I feel like we're kind of getting bogged down in theory land so let's take a look at an example. I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. There's my snow fort. It's a D on the flag to represent me. There's me little hot cocoa, couple marshmallows floating in there, my Khan Academy mug."
Language,"They don't make Khan Academy mugs. I want a Khan Academy mug. Okay, so what conclusions can we draw from these two sentences? I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. Beautiful, brilliant, enormous. Then I came inside and had a big mug of hot chocolate. Same deal, brilliant, beautiful, enormous. What conclusions can I draw about this situation? Well if you're making things out of snow and then you're coming inside and having hot chocolate, it's probably not the height of summer."
Language,"One inference that I can draw from these two sentences together is that it is winter time when this sentence takes place. Where I live, these are not activities that one pursues in the height of summer outside. I'm looking for clues within the text. Snow fort, I'm outside, I came inside and then I had hot chocolate which is not traditionally a beverage that is consumed when it's warm out. Let's take a look at another example."
Language,"This paragraph is part of a longer passage that is about a young ballet dancer named Michaela. Michaela danced so wonderfully that she was awarded a scholarship to attend the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School at the American Ballet Theater. That was only the beginning of her dancing success. When she was 17, Michaela danced with the Dance Theater of Harlem professional company. Later, she joined the Dutch National Junior Company. Today, Michaela is a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet."
Language,"So very quickly without getting bogged down in this passage, what are some conclusions, what are some inferences that we can draw about Michaela? Who is Michaela? What do we know about her? We know that she's a dancer. We know that she's very good at it, right? She danced so wonderfully that she got a scholarship. So I'm gonna say Michaela is very talented and we know that her talent led to success because her getting the scholarship was only the beginning of her dancing success."
Language,"We can see from the passage that she was part of at least three different dance companies, the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Dutch National Junior Company, and as a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet today. So I'm gonna say that Michaela is a very hard worker. Now notice no where in the passage does it say Michaela is a very talented, hard working dancer. Just like in the previous example, it didn't say, it was winter outside so I made a snow fort."
Language,"What the skill of inference is requires you to be a detective and take your magnifying glass to the passage to discover clues. Imagine you're a detective like this dog. He's wearing a little deer stalker cap. Let's call him, let's call him Sherlock Bones, the famous dog detective that I just made up. I feel like Sherlock Holmes is always smoking a pipe so I'm gonna give this dog like a, I don't know a bone or a piece of rawhide or something."
Language,"Imagine that you are a detective or a dog detective if you like and every time you read a text, let's say a book, that you are searching for clues within it. What you're doing when you make an inference is you are taking the information that you already know about the world and the places and people in it and how they behave and what they look like and what they do and you're applying that knowledge to the text."
Language,"When do people build snowmen? When do people build snow forts? When do they drink hot cocoa? In the winter time. An important thing to remember though is that inferring is not guessing. Any time you make an inference, you have to be pulling it directly from the text. That's your jumping off point. It can't just be a wild guess out of no where. It comes from information that you've got there on the page. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go eat my weight in cough drops."
Language,"You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"Tone communicates how an author feels about the topic they're writing about, this can come across in a number of different ways, it can reflect their enthusiasm or skepticism, it can also communicate formality or informality, an academic paper or a speech before the UN, for example are very different things from a toast at a wedding or a thank you card for a birthday gift and this kind of difference in tone is something that sociologists and linguists call register."
Language,"Social conventions and customs call for different registers in different circumstances, just as it would be inappropriate in most situations to wear a tuxedo at the beach, so too would it be incongruous to use extremely formal language in an informal setting? (melodic orchestral music) (clearing throat) Dear honored sir, it was the privilege of my very life to have you attend my 14th birthday party. I am grateful beyond words for your most generous gift, a check for $36 American."
Language,"Your humble and obedient servant, David. In fact using extremely formal language and high-minded gratitude for something as relatively small as a birthday gift might even come across as sarcastic or insulting. But this is sort of an extreme example, let's pull back and discuss how an understanding of tone can aid you in making sense of informational texts."
Language,"One great way to do that is to analyze word choice, we can look at a writer's language and determine their attitude towards the subject based on the words they've chosen to describe it. Oceans of ink have been spilled over comparisons between a Chicago style hotdog and a New York style hotdog. The first with its garden's worth of toppings, but a holier than now prohibition of ketchup, the latter with its sauerkraut, mustard and dubious dirty water cooking style."
Language,"But scant attention, a droplet of ink before the ocean has been paid to the half-smoke, the unsung but mighty regional sausage of Washington DC. Now how does the author think about the subject? Well, we know that they think that not enough writing has been done about DC's regional sausage, the half-smoke, but how do they feel about it? How do the words they use express their feelings? Let's break it down bit by bit."
Language,"So right out of the gate, we have oceans of ink, this is a deliberate piece of overstatement, there are no literal oceans made of ink, but it's being set up in opposition to the droplet of ink used to describe half-smokes later in the paragraph."
Language,"Half-smokes are described as unsung, but mighty, which suggests that they haven't been given their due, there hasn't been enough praise for half-smokes and that therefore the amount of attention given to Chicago and New York hotdogs is unfair or even disproportionate. I think we can also determine from word choice, that the author thinks a Chicago hot dog is a little ridiculous and that a New York hot dog is a little gross."
Language,"How do we know this? Chicagoans generally don't like ketchup on their hotdogs and the way the author phrases this is by saying, that they have a holier than thou prohibition on ketchup, which is to say they get all haughty and upset about it, which is weird because it's ketchup, listen, I'm a Chicagoan by birth, I used to feel this way and I'm not even sure why."
Language,"Similarly the word dubious in the description of the New York hotdog, meaning doubtful suggests that the dirty water cooking method is kind of nasty sounding, why would the author do this? Is it to say these are terrible hot dogs and nobody should eat them? No, I don't think so, The author is trying to make room for the half-smoke in the national sausage conversation and to do that, they're first trying to dismantle the importance of New York and Chicago style by making fun of them."
Language,"These are tactical choices, not to be confused with authorial voice, which is a different concept entirely an author's voice is their style, it's much more consistent across topics, whereas a tone is specific to a topic. So I might have an authorial voice, that uses a lot of goofy wordplay, but I use a sympathetic tone to talk about bears and a hostile tone to talk about, I don't know, whales, yeah, boo whales, I said it. I do not actually hate whales, I love whales."
Language,"But my point is this, use your knowledge of words, of the connotation and implications of the language, that an author might use to unlock your understanding of their tone, because if you can do that, my friend, you can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"It doesn't contain violence, obscenity or profanity. Or even anything that wouldn't appear in a G-rated movie, but it will contain explicit evidence. Yes, we're talking about citing evidence in literary analysis. When you're talking about a text and making arguments about it, in order to successfully build that argument, you must make inferences and draw conclusions. And those must be built on the back of evidence."
Language,"Both explicit, that is stated in the text, or implicit or based on clues or evidence in the text. So your responsibility is to tie those conclusions or inferences back to explicit or implicit evidence in the text. It can't just be, ""This is a feeling I have."" It has to be, ""My feeling about this is backed up by this specific evidence."" Say you're trying to be make an argument in a book that the captain of this pirate ship, let's just say, I guess, he's a birdman. That's what I drew, he's a birdman."
Language,"He's really unkind to the main character in the beginning of the book, but changes by the end of the book and treats everyone, including the main character with respect and courtesy. So I'm gonna write that my argument is that the captain's behavior changes towards the MC, the main character. I have to back that assertion up with evidence. So how do we find those details? First, you have to seek out parts of the book where the captain and the main character interact."
Language,"Then look closely at the pros and dialogue. What are the details that prove your point? Which are the strongest, most specific details that say, ""Oh, yes, here is where the captain is being mean. Here is where the captain is being respectful."" If you can't find evidence for your assertion, first, try searching in a different part of the book. Or importantly, acknowledge the possibility that you might have a weak argument."
Language,"Maybe it's time to start over and find a new or different argument to make and find support for. Once you've assembled your evidence work it into your analysis. ""Captain Bigsby is dismissive and rude to Eniola when she first joins the crew of the pirate ship Albatross,"" I might say. And then back it up with an explicit example of Captain Bigsby being dismissive and rude with a page number citation like so."
Language,"On page 34 of ""To the Burbling Deep,"" Bigsby says to Eniola, ""You there, what's her name! These portholes need to be scrubbed yesterday. Get to work!."" ""Yes, sir, Captain,"" Eniola said. ""But my name is-"" ""Does it look like I care?"" the captain snarled. But by the end of the story, when Eniola has proven her worth, saved the day, and humbled the captain, he treats her, and everyone around him, with much greater respect and deference."
Language,"On page 225, after Bigsby tends to Eniola's broken leg, he tells her, ""Eniola, that was some mighty fine pirating you did. You showed no fear when you punched that kraken, and more importantly, you showed no fear when you stood up to me. I was wrong, and I have been a jerk, and I am sorry."" Now both of those examples use explicit evidence where Captain Bigsby is being a jerk and then when he is apologizing for being a jerk. There's also implicit evidence too. Bigsby tends to Eniola's broken leg."
Language,"So while he's not saying, ""I will take care of you little buddy,"" with his words, he is saying it with his actions. And in that first example when he demands that Eniola clean the portholes, he's not literally saying, ""I'm impatient,"" But by saying, ""They need to be scrubbed yesterday,"" as an immediately because you already messed up, he's implying that he's impatient. Now there is no such book that I know of about a kraken punching girl pirate. But if we're lucky, my friend Jordan will write one."
Language,"Remember to use strong details to get good evidence. There might be a part of ""To The Burbling Deep"" where Captain Bigsby huffs angrily at Eniola but doesn't say anything, and that's mean or, at least, impolite, but it's not as strong as him yelling at her. So when you find the detail, ask yourself, how does that detail related back to your analysis or your argument."
Language,"Is it repeated? Does that detail or detail similar to it appear elsewhere in the text? And if you see a lot of similar details, how do those details prove the argument that you're trying to make? If you have a sense of what the central idea or ideas of the text is, try to connect those details back to that central idea and then connect that central idea to your own argument. I don't know what ""To the Burbling Deep"" is about 'cause I made it up 20 minutes ago."
Language,"But maybe one theme in it is that it's important to recognize the potential with another people. And that can be both true for Eniola who becomes a hero and punches a giant octopus monster, but it can also be true of Captain Bigsby who occupies kind of antagonistic role and then changes through the story. And so we can build our argument around that idea that character change is possible. Not just for the main character, but for everybody. So that's where I will leave you."
Language,"Remember to choose the pieces of evidence that give you the strongest support for your idea and if the evidence doesn't match your idea, you might need to change the idea itself. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"But I think it is unwise to think of it as a one-way conversation. The best arguments do not plunge forward heedlessly. They do not steamroll opposition. Rather, they seek out opposing arguments and incorporate them. Good readers pay attention to how authors acknowledge opposing viewpoints in an argument. Doing this makes it easier to decide how well thought out an argument is and determine whether the author is knowledgeable and thoughtful in their position."
Language,"Now, I do not practice the martial art of Wing Chun. But that style of self-defense is famous for techniques that block and strike at the same time. Your opponent's fist comes in, you redirect it away from your body, and in that same motion continue your momentum into its own immediate counterstrike. Acknowledging the existence of opposing viewpoints has two main applications, which are pretty different."
Language,"First, maybe you're not on any side of the argument and you wish to straightforwardly describe the conflict, like a journalist reporting on a lawsuit. It's a journalist's responsibility to truthfully portray the full scope of information on a topic, bringing every piece of relevant and plausible information to bear. The author provides equal time to the disputants and tries not to provide their own opinion here. That could look like this. Ms. Adeyemi contended that Mr."
Language,"Dupont stole the cookies from her cookie jar, and that furthermore, she had baked those cookies in the first place, thus strengthening her claim to the said cookies. Of the 24 cookies baked by Ms. Adeyemi, she alleges that 10 of them were taken by Mr. Dupont. Mr. Dupont, however, contended that as he was the person who made the cookie jar for Ms. Adeyemi in the ceramics class he took, he is entitled to the occasional cookie."
Language,"He does not dispute the 10-cookie figure, adding only that they were ""delicious."" Judge Huang, upon reviewing testimony from both parties, sided with Ms. Adeyemi, saying that you are not entitled to a cookie just for being a good friend one time, and that next time, Mr. Dupont should ask for permission. Now, looking at that situation, my personal opinion is that it is inappropriate to steal your friend's cookies. An opinion that any right-thinking person should share."
Language,"But injecting opinion may not be appropriate in all cases. So okay, that's the first case. Reporting on multiple sides of a dispute without getting involved yourself. Now, the second reason, the second application for including opposing viewpoints in an argumentative piece of writing is that Wing Chun thing, the block as you strike technique."
Language,"It makes your argument stronger if you anticipate possible objections to it, address them, and strike them down all the while still making your argument in the first place. Let's take this example from the website. This piece is about the lost colony at Roanoke. A bunch of English settlers disappeared under uncertain circumstances for reasons still unknown. And the author's trying to make the case that although theories for the disappearance exist, the truth is still beyond our grasp."
Language,"So in order to make that case, they address several different theories that attempt to explain the disappearance. Many people have tried to solve the mystery of the lost colony. Historians and archeologists have searched for answers for hundreds of years. Some possible solutions are: A, Native people killed the colonists on Roanoke Island. B, the colonists were all killed on Roanoke Island by disease. C, their town was washed away by a hurricane, and the people drowned."
Language,"Or D, they all left Roanoke Island and went to live in some other place. Now, watch what the author does as they systematically go through each theory and address it. I've only excepted the first two, so let's look at those first two. A, when John White got back to Roanoke Island in 1590 he did not find any bones or bodies or any signs of fighting. Bones last a long time. If Native people had killed the colonists, there would probably have been some remains or other signs of violence."
Language,"We can guess that the colonists were not killed on Roanoke Island. B, when the English first came to Virginia, they're using a 16th-century spelling, they brought diseases with them, such as flu and smallpox, that were new to the Native communities. They had no immunity against them and many died very quickly. Letters written by the colonists tell us that the English remained healthy. And remember, no bones or bodies or graves were found. We can guess that the colonists did not all die of disease."
Language,"So the author's saying that these events are unlikely, taking the theories seriously, and then thinking them through to their conclusions. But demonstrating why they don't seem very likely explanations. Why do they think it's unlikely that Native people killed those colonists? There aren't any remains or signs of combat. Why does it seem unlikely that they died of diseases? There are no graves or remains. The thesis is, nobody knows why."
Language,"Here are two counters to it basically saying here's why, and the author says here's why these are unlikely to be true which weakens those counterarguments and strengthens the original. Block, strike. My overall point is this. Don't ignore the potential counters to your argument. Incorporate them, analyze them, and redirect their energy into your own position. And when you read, notice if the author is acknowledging counters or ignoring them. If they ignore them, you should be suspicious."
Language,"Why are they ignoring them? If you can answer that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"We can say something quietly or really loudly to emphasize a point. We can emphasize some words, but not others. We can pause, to create dramatic tension. We know that how something is said is important because when we don't have that information, sometimes it's hard to know what another person is really saying. Say that you forgot about your friend Eli's birthday party."
Language,"So you text them, ""hey, sorry I missed your party."" Seriously for me this is one of the most anxiety-inducing situations that I encounter on a regular basis. What does Eli actually mean here? It's fine. Or it's fine or it's fine. Is it fine or isn't it? Gang, I don't know. Eli's tone and body language, which we can't see in just a text message, add in important elements of meaning. We can apply that knowledge to how we speak and how we assess the speech of others."
Language,"Good public speakers use a range of techniques to convey their message to their audience, which goes beyond just the words that they say. They become actors who are telling us a story on stage, not just with their lines, but with their physical presence. So, let's talk about some of these techniques and then we'll watch a little bit of a speech so you can spot some examples. First, there's vocal variety. This means using different speaking speeds and changing between soft and loud speaking volumes."
Language,"When people don't do this, we say that they're speaking in a monotone, you know. Bueller? Bueller? Vocal variation adds excitement and emphasis to speech. Then there's language. Here I mean the choice of words and the rhetorical devices the speaker uses to appeal to their audience and make the audience agree with their points."
Language,"So, for example, if you're at a business convention, you would expect a speaker to use pretty formal language like, good evening my esteemed colleagues, tonight I want to discuss the importance of market research and connecting with our customer base. You wouldn't expect the speaker to say, ""(indistinct), I'm a Hanker and (indistinct) tonight. ""Let's go mine some gold."" But if you were at a gold miners convention, maybe that's exactly what you would expect to hear."
Language,"Language also includes the rhetorical devices that help to structure an argument. For example, repetition. Repeating the same word or phrase can help hammer it home or make the speaker's point feel more urgent. In Martin Luther King Jr's ""I have a dream"" speech, he starts eight sentences in a row with the phrase, ""I have a dream."" So these two points cover how a speaker talks, but there are also physical aspects to giving a speech."
Language,"Gestures and eye contact, visual aids, and the use of the stage area itself. The speaker can pace back and forth to show they're feeling agitated, or throw their shoulders back to show they're feeling proud. They can use their hands to emphasize what they're saying. Speakers can use props if they want to, a chart or image or an object. And just like actors can have performances that are great, and performances that are only so, so."
Language,"Speakers can use all of these techniques to great effect, or they can miss the mark by seeming phony or uncomfortable. So let's take a look at a speech and its delivery to see if we can spot any of these techniques and what messages they convey. This is a speech from 1988 by the then governor of Texas Ann Richards at the Democratic National Convention. I'll fast forward to the good parts. - Those were real people with real problems and they had real dreams about getting out of the depression."
Language,I can remember summer nights when we had put down what we call the Baptist palette and we listened to the grownups talk. I can still hear the sound of the dominoes clicking on the marble slab my daddy had found for a tabletop.
Language,"- [Narrator] Did you see what she did there? What's her language telling us about who she is? What did she do with her hands there when she talked about the dominoes? She's telling us she's not fancy, she's from an ordinary background and she helps us visualize the scene by wiggling her fingers like she's putting down dominoes. - I got a letter last week from a young mother in Lorena, Texas, and I wanna read part of it to you. - [Narrator] Okay."
Language,"How about that? What did you think about her opening up that letter? Is that actually the letter she received from the young mother? Probably not. I think I can see the text on it and it's really big. So, she's probably reading from a typed copy. It's folded in thirds though, like a letter that came in an envelope. It gives you the impression that this is a real letter, something she got in the mail, and she's telling you the plain truth from it. This is a visual aid. Okay."
Language,Let's skip the middle of the letter and see how Governor Richards delivers the end of it. - We plot along trying to make it better for ourselves and our children and our parents. We aren't vocal anymore. I think maybe we're too tired. I believe that people like us are forgotten in America. - [Narrator] What did you notice about how Governor Richards delivered those last two sentences? I think maybe we're too tired. She sounds tired. And she pauses between the words.
Language,"I believe that people like us are forgotten in America. All of those pauses give weight and emphasis to the experience of the young mother. This is vocal variety. Okay. This is the last one we'll talk about. - They've told farmers that they were selfish, that they would drive up food prices if they asked the government to intervene on behalf of the family farm and we watch farms go on the auction block while we bought food from foreign countries. Well, that's wrong."
Language,(crowd applauds) They told working mothers it's all their fault that families are falling apart because they had to go to work to keep their kids in jeans and tennis shoes in college and they're wrong. (crowd applauds) They told American labor they were trying to ruin free enterprise by asking for 60 days notice of plant closings and that's wrong. (crowd applauds) - [Narrator] What did you hear repeated several times in this section? That's wrong. This is a rhetorical device.
Language,"What does it make you feel about the points Governor Richards was making here? It kind of feels like they're piling on each other, right? She's adding more and more evidence to her case. So the next time you watch a speech, keep these techniques in mind. They'll help you see how a compelling speaker can transform the text of the speech with vocal and physical effects.."
Language,"At the time of this recording, I'm 31 and I run into new and confusing words every day. I read a lot and it's always a fun challenge to run into words like, I don't know, glabrous or limned or nacreous. I know a lot about language and even I have trouble figuring out what those words mean on their own. So it's important to rely on context, the language that surrounds the word. Let's say you're reading a text and you come across a sentence that has a word in it you don't recognize."
Language,"Here's a bit from a passage about the famous chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. ""Jane Goodall arrived at Tanzania's ""Gombee Stream National Park in 1960. ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers. ""After all, she had not yet been to college."" So let's pause on unconventional. What does that word mean? Well, let me give you some ideas, that's the memory aid I use to keep it straight."
Language,"IDEAS, it stands for inference, definition, example, antonym, synonym, I-D-E-A-S, IDEAS, which are all different kinds of context clues. Every word will have a different context, so you might need to vary your approach. The way this snippet is written let's try inference first, then I'll rewrite the sentence a few times to show you the other methods. Okay, the I in IDEAS, inference. We can draw conclusions from the context."
Language,"If we don't know what unconventional means, we can take a look at the rest of the sentence or other nearby sentences to figure it out. Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal."
Language,"And because I'm making an inference about this word's meaning I wanna keep an eye out for it in other places to see if I can confirm or revise that working definition later. D - definition. Context clues like these will just give you the definition of the word in question. So a good example of that would be: ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers."
Language,"""She hadn't been to college yet, ""and this made her different and unexpected."" Different and unexpected is a great definition for the word unconventional. This style of context clue occurs when the author expects a word to be unfamiliar to you and builds in a guide for you right there in the text. The E in IDEAS stands for example, and this is somewhere between inference and definition. If the author describes Goodall as unconventional, they'll go on to talk about something unconventional that Goodall did."
Language,"""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among animal researchers. ""For one thing, she hadn't been to college yet."" So this is very similar to that initial sentence, except for the transition phrase for one thing, which is a way to set up examples. Antonym - an antonym is a word whose meaning is the opposite of another word, like how night is the opposite of day, or how love is the opposite of hate."
Language,"So if there's an example in the text of what Jane Goodall was not, we can use that to figure out what she was. So let's say the passage said: ""Goodall was unconventional. ""She didn't conform, and she wasn't ordinary."" There we have two antonyms and our answer. Similarly, synonym just means write another word with the same meaning similar to a definition. ""Jane Goodall was unconventional. ""She was a nonconformist."
Language,"""She went against the grain."" You can see that I had to rewrite the sentences each time to apply to each context clue strategy, which shows me that you won't find all five context clues every time you need to search for a word's meaning. You need to find the approach that makes the most sense in context. See what I did there, ah huh? And failing that, you can always look up an unfamiliar word in a dictionary. I love to do that."
Language,"I think that's great, but I also feel a sense of victory when I correctly figure out what a new word means, when I've put it together from context. And maybe if I'm still curious, I look it up later and then I turn out to be right, and I'm all like ""Victory at sea, I did it!"" Oh, and if you were curious, glabrous means smooth and hairless like a leaf or the skin of a frog. Nacreous means shiny and rainbow colored like the inside of an oyster shell."
Language,"And to limn something means to draw the outline of or to be highlighted in light. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I don't literally mean that I've got a bear. That would be extremely sweet. Love a bear, love bear's whole thing with the snacking and the sleeping and the eating of fish, but no. A bear of is a figurative expression that means something difficult. So a bear of a lesson is a difficult lesson and that's what we're talking about today. Not bears, sorry, but non-literal uses of language, which we call figurative language or figures of speech. Figurative language says one thing but means another."
Language,"I could say that my colleague Allison is an eagle-eyed editor and when I say that I don't mean that she literally has an eagle's eyes in her head. That would be a terrifying achievement of medical science. No, I'm saying that she is sharp and attentive in the same way that an eagle is. So I'm saying something that is not literally true in order to express something that is true, that Allison is good at editing. Would you call that a lie? I'm not sure I would."
Language,"It's just a non-literal way of expressing myself. So, having gotten the question of whether or not I'm a dirty rotten liar out of the way, let's talk about some different varieties of figurative language. First, the simile. A simile is a comparison between two things that uses like or as. If I were really hungry, I could say that my stomach was gurgling like a tar pit or that I was as hungry as a ravenous wolf, and again, neither of these things are literally true."
Language,"If my stomach were making actual tar pit noises, I would probably need to go to a hospital. But what do those examples tell you about the way that I, the speaker, think about my hunger? Animals and people get stuck in tar pits, they're gloppy, they pull things into them, they slow things down. Sorry T-Rex. Therefore, I'm saying that my hunger is slowing me down. Or, if I'm comparing myself to a wolf, you can imagine me looking lean and desperate, saliva dripping from my jaws at the mere thought of food."
Language,"I could really go for a cheese danish come to think of it. So that's simile. The second figure of speech I wanna talk about today is the metaphor. And what's a metaphor? Cows and sheep! Sorry, I couldn't help it. No, a metaphor is not a meadow for. Metaphors are another way of comparing two things, but this time there's no like or as. We're walking this language tightrope without a net now."
Language,"You aren't signaling with like or as that you're making a figurative comparison, so you have to use context to communicate clearly. At the beginning of this video I said this was going to be a bear of a lesson. That's a metaphor. There's a Linda Ronstadt country song from the 70s, called ""Love is a Rose,"" which is all about how to take care of a relationship through the metaphor of tending a flower with thorns on it."
Language,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person."
Language,"To say that differently, it's ascribing human characteristics to non-living things. The wind howled through the mountains. The car grumbled as I threw it into gear. The storm raged. These are things that people do, but I'm applying that language to inanimate things, like wind and cars and storms in order to express the way these things are behaving. The car is not literally grumbling, ""Aw man, I can't believe David has to drive me today."" It's making noises that I am choosing to identify as unhappy."
Language,"The greatest kind of figurative language in the entire universe is hyperbole. By exaggerating, I'm expressing emphasis and importance. This summer, I'm going to read a million books and eat a literal actual ton of hot dogs. This is not true. In fact, this is impossible. That is too many hot dogs, those are too many books, each of which are sentences I never expected to say, but I'm trying to express my enthusiasm for both books and encased meats, and I'm doing that by being, you know, extra."
Language,"The final kind of expressive language I wanna talk about today isn't exactly figurative language, it's the language of allusions and references. Where you make comparisons to characters or events from literature, or movies, or culture. Also note that it's allusion with an A, as opposed to illusion with an I. An illusion with an I is like a magic trick. Here are some examples of allusions. Oh, you'd have to be Superman to lift that fallen tree. Or, you have a Gollum-like obsession with that stuffed animal."
Language,"Now these comparisons only work if the person you're talking to understands the reference. Superman has super strength, Gollum, from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" can't stop talking about how much he loves this one object, the ring. If you don't know the reference, then it's all just noise. One tip is to read up on mythology. You'd be surprised how many times ancient gods, like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo come up as you read. So that's what we're working with here. Simile, love is like a rose."
Language,"Metaphor, love is a rose. Personification, my car grumbled. Hyperbole, my mom grounded me for eight trillion years. And allusion, I feel mightier than Hercules. That's figurative language folks. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word. This is distinct from denotation, which is more like the dictionary definition of a word. Companion and buddy both have similar denotations. They both mean friend, but companion is a much more formal sounding word than buddy. Which originated as a piece of slang from the 19th century."
Language,"So even though their denotation or their literal definition is the same, they feel different. The connotation of companion is formal while the connotation of buddy is friendly and casual. Good readers pay close attention to the words the author chose to use. They picked those words for a reason. How do those words make you feel? What is the author trying to imply? How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"(tense big band music) Friday was a very straightforward, almost relentless, character and the catchphrase associated with his character was ""Just the facts."" ""All we want are the facts, ma'am,"" was the sort of thing that he would say. And that's what we're talking about today: just the facts. There's this idea called objectivity. That you can talk about something without inserting any opinions which are personal thoughts or beliefs."
Language,"Doing this, being objective, is very difficult; opinions want to creep in. So what does it mean for a summary to be objective? It means it isn't influenced by feelings or opinions, it's not written in the first person, it's about the text, not me, and it's not a judgment or a review of the information. Let's be clear here; it's not bad to have opinions. In my opinion, it is good to have opinions, but they do not have a place in summaries. You can put opinions to use when you analyze or evaluate something."
Language,"When you're looking at summaries and you're trying to determine whether one is objective or not, look for words that cast judgment. Does the writer say something is good or terrible or useful or useless? Let's do this together. I'll take this text and summarize it without any opinions. Polar bears hunt for seals on thick sea ice in the Arctic. As the Earth grows warmer, though, sea ice gets thinner."
Language,"With less stable ground, some hungry polar bears search for food inland, often dangerously close to human environments. Although polar bears usually keep to themselves, a very scared or angry one could attack, and even eat, a human. Several villages have set up polar bear patrols as a result. The patrollers zoom around on snowmobiles, using bright lights and loud noises to scare away polar bears. Hopefully, the polar bears find another snack later on."
Language,"Here's my summary: Climate change causes polar bears to encroach on human habitats to search for food. As a consequence, these villages have set up polar bear patrols to frighten them away. As a person who cares about climate change, as well as the wellbeing of bears and human beings, I have all sorts of opinions about this, but for the purposes of summarizing that paragraph, I have to put them aside. Just the facts, ma'am."
Language,"(Dragnet theme) If you get good enough at making objective summaries, you'll start noticing when opinion creeps into things you expect to be objective. And it won't be obvious like bears are terrible and humans are right to scare them away or climate change ravages bear habitats, sending defenseless bears into the jaws of doom: human villages. But it might be in the way a story is framed. Like, there's a difference between bears move into human habitats and bears are forced into human habitats."
Language,"What causes them to move? Forced by whom or by what? Sometimes what's not in a text can be as important as what's in it. Experiment with this a little. Try summarizing some news articles and see if you can restate the facts of the stories without inserting any opinions. It's a fun challenge and it may expose an opinion where you didn't expect to see it. Objectively, you can learn anything. David out. Constant vigilance!."

Language,"It is a giant robot made up of five smaller robots, each one piloted by a person. Five friends, each with control over a different part of the robot's body. You're up in the head, I'm operating the right leg, our buddy's operating the left, and so on. In order to walk or pick up objects or fight space monsters the size of battleships, all the disparate of the robot have to function together. Well, texts work much the same way."
Language,"Each portion of the text, from the section level down to more granular divisions like individual paragraphs or sentences, is trying to serve the broader point of the text. When we look at Voltron's foot in motion, we analyze what the foot is doing in the service of Voltron as a whole."
Language,"If Voltron's foot kicks a ball, we have to zoom out to ask, is Voltron playing soccer? This is a pretty abstract idea without any text examples, so let's stop talking about space robots and start talking about the Armor of 10th-century Japanese horse archers. All right, so this whole passage is about the armor worn by mounted archer samurai of 10th-century Japan, o-yoroi, and how it's constructed. So this is a piece of o-yoroi armor. This is the whole assemblage."
Language,"And that's how the piece is divided, right? We've got the sections here for each component. The cuirass, the o-sode or shoulder guards, the kusazuri, or armored skirt, and the kabuto, the helmet. And each one of these elements of the armor connects back to the whole point of the piece, which is describing how the armor does two things. One, it protects the wearer, and two, allows them to ride horses and fire arrows. Now we see this in the introductory paragraph."
Language,"Their armor, called o-yoroi, was designed specifically to withstand the demands of mounted archer warfare. So let's dig into this first section about the cuirass, the breastplate and backplate armor. I'll read the first paragraph. ""A cuirass is usually a piece of armor ""that consists of a breastplate and a backplate ""that are attached together. ""The cuirass for the o-yoroi was a bit different ""than a typical cuirass, ""as it was designed to be more effective for an archer."
Language,"""The o-yoroi cuirass had three sections instead of two. ""A section to protect the back, ""a section to protect the chest, ""and a section to protect the left side body. ""The right side was left open ""so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow."" So this paragraph is describing what a cuirass is and how it functions as armor, but then it goes into detailing how an o-yoroi cuirass is different because it's for someone holding a bow, right? It has three sections instead of two."
Language,"The right side was left open so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow. This information down to the sentence level all serves the same purpose. It serves to answer the question, how was o-yoroi armor specifically designed to meet the needs of a mounted archer? Not every sentence or every paragraph will address every part of that main question. Note that the cuirass section doesn't cover anything about how the archers are on horseback."
Language,"To answer that question, we need to go down to the third section, the kusazuri, the battle skirt. I'm not gonna read the whole paragraph. Let's just zoom in on this one sentence. ""The kusazuri were designed so that when the warrior ""was sitting in his horse's saddle, ""they fit nicely over the saddle in a skirtlike fashion ""to protect his lower body and upper legs."" This particular sentence tells us how this part of the armor protects the samurai's legs while they're on horseback."
Language,The paragraph and section it's part of detail the whole construction of that part of the armor and how it relates to the other pieces. And all of those paragraphs together form one text that explained the thing it set out to explain. What is o-yoroi and how does it work for 10th-century horse archer samurai? Each section or paragraph is like a leg or an arm of Voltron. Each sentence is a muscle or a finger or a robo-toe.
Language,"Together, moving as one, they tell a story or make an argument, which I guess is like Voltron winning a fight, maybe. I feel like I've carried this metaphor as far as it'll go. The point is, if you're having trouble making sense of an informational text, think of it as a giant battle robot. What is each of component part of the text trying to accomplish? And when you put all those parts together, what are they trying to do? Well, my work here is done. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"But I think it is unwise to think of it as a one-way conversation. The best arguments do not plunge forward heedlessly. They do not steamroll opposition. Rather, they seek out opposing arguments and incorporate them. Good readers pay attention to how authors acknowledge opposing viewpoints in an argument. Doing this makes it easier to decide how well thought out an argument is and determine whether the author is knowledgeable and thoughtful in their position."
Language,"Now, I do not practice the martial art of Wing Chun. But that style of self-defense is famous for techniques that block and strike at the same time. Your opponent's fist comes in, you redirect it away from your body, and in that same motion continue your momentum into its own immediate counterstrike. Acknowledging the existence of opposing viewpoints has two main applications, which are pretty different."
Language,"First, maybe you're not on any side of the argument and you wish to straightforwardly describe the conflict, like a journalist reporting on a lawsuit. It's a journalist's responsibility to truthfully portray the full scope of information on a topic, bringing every piece of relevant and plausible information to bear. The author provides equal time to the disputants and tries not to provide their own opinion here. That could look like this. Ms. Adeyemi contended that Mr."
Language,"Dupont stole the cookies from her cookie jar, and that furthermore, she had baked those cookies in the first place, thus strengthening her claim to the said cookies. Of the 24 cookies baked by Ms. Adeyemi, she alleges that 10 of them were taken by Mr. Dupont. Mr. Dupont, however, contended that as he was the person who made the cookie jar for Ms. Adeyemi in the ceramics class he took, he is entitled to the occasional cookie."
Language,"He does not dispute the 10-cookie figure, adding only that they were ""delicious."" Judge Huang, upon reviewing testimony from both parties, sided with Ms. Adeyemi, saying that you are not entitled to a cookie just for being a good friend one time, and that next time, Mr. Dupont should ask for permission. Now, looking at that situation, my personal opinion is that it is inappropriate to steal your friend's cookies. An opinion that any right-thinking person should share."
Language,"But injecting opinion may not be appropriate in all cases. So okay, that's the first case. Reporting on multiple sides of a dispute without getting involved yourself. Now, the second reason, the second application for including opposing viewpoints in an argumentative piece of writing is that Wing Chun thing, the block as you strike technique."
Language,"It makes your argument stronger if you anticipate possible objections to it, address them, and strike them down all the while still making your argument in the first place. Let's take this example from the website. This piece is about the lost colony at Roanoke. A bunch of English settlers disappeared under uncertain circumstances for reasons still unknown. And the author's trying to make the case that although theories for the disappearance exist, the truth is still beyond our grasp."
Language,"So in order to make that case, they address several different theories that attempt to explain the disappearance. Many people have tried to solve the mystery of the lost colony. Historians and archeologists have searched for answers for hundreds of years. Some possible solutions are: A, Native people killed the colonists on Roanoke Island. B, the colonists were all killed on Roanoke Island by disease. C, their town was washed away by a hurricane, and the people drowned."
Language,"Or D, they all left Roanoke Island and went to live in some other place. Now, watch what the author does as they systematically go through each theory and address it. I've only excepted the first two, so let's look at those first two. A, when John White got back to Roanoke Island in 1590 he did not find any bones or bodies or any signs of fighting. Bones last a long time. If Native people had killed the colonists, there would probably have been some remains or other signs of violence."
Language,"We can guess that the colonists were not killed on Roanoke Island. B, when the English first came to Virginia, they're using a 16th-century spelling, they brought diseases with them, such as flu and smallpox, that were new to the Native communities. They had no immunity against them and many died very quickly. Letters written by the colonists tell us that the English remained healthy. And remember, no bones or bodies or graves were found. We can guess that the colonists did not all die of disease."
Language,"So the author's saying that these events are unlikely, taking the theories seriously, and then thinking them through to their conclusions. But demonstrating why they don't seem very likely explanations. Why do they think it's unlikely that Native people killed those colonists? There aren't any remains or signs of combat. Why does it seem unlikely that they died of diseases? There are no graves or remains. The thesis is, nobody knows why."
Language,"Here are two counters to it basically saying here's why, and the author says here's why these are unlikely to be true which weakens those counterarguments and strengthens the original. Block, strike. My overall point is this. Don't ignore the potential counters to your argument. Incorporate them, analyze them, and redirect their energy into your own position. And when you read, notice if the author is acknowledging counters or ignoring them. If they ignore them, you should be suspicious."
Language,"Why are they ignoring them? If you can answer that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word. This is distinct from denotation, which is more like the dictionary definition of a word. Companion and buddy both have similar denotations.

Good readers pay close attention to the words the author chose to use. They picked those words for a reason. How do those words make you feel? What is the author trying to imply? How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"""This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why."" Argument does not sneak, it does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories: data, fact, observable reality. There is a place for pure subjective opinion, and it is the realm of the movie and the restaurant review."
Language,"""I did not like this movie because I didn't laugh at its jokes."" ""I did not enjoy the hamburger I got because I found it too dry for my liking."" This is not what we're talking about today. Obviously, argument is rooted in opinion and subjective personal preferences, but those opinions need to be backed up with evidence. Let's compare arguments for and against a tax on soda."
Language,"Now, this writer argues that sugar contributes to obesity, and therefore, people should be prevented from buying soda, which is full of sugar on the grounds that it is bad for them, let's take a look. The soda tax could alter many people's behavior, causing them to stop buying sugary drinks. Some foods are necessities like milk, eggs, and bread. People will buy them even if the prices increase. Sugary drinks aren't necessary."
Language,"If the price goes up, people will buy fewer sugary drinks and they won't be consuming as much sugar, therefore, the obesity rate will go down. Whereas this author counters that people have a right to make what they see as unhealthy decisions. Soda and other sugary drinks have been targeted because they lack nutrition and are basically just liquid sugar. Most people would agree that proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
Language,"However, do legislators have the right or responsibility to regulate people's sugar intake in order to improve their health? I say, no. All right, let's evaluate these claims. For the first argument in favor of the soda tax, how do we know this is true? What evidence does this author give that this tax will alter people's behavior? What evidence does this author give that sugary drinks aren't seen to be as essential as milk? After all, not everyone can or does drink milk."
Language,"In the piece, the evidence that the author gives us is this table, which shows how much sugar is in soda per serving, but it doesn't use evidence to connect sugar consumption to unhealthy outcomes. All this says is, soda has a lot of sugar. I wanna see evidence, I wanna see studies. How do we know this tax would change behavior? Good readers think through the impacts of an argument."
Language,"If this tax went into effect, what would the consequences be? Are there faults in the author's logic? It might stop some people from buying soda, but in an unfair way. Here's how I'm processing this as a reader. If you take a bottle of soda that previously costs, say $2, and the tax makes it $10, that will make it more difficult to purchase. But to a millionaire, the difference between $2 and $10 is basically nothing. Whereas to a poor or middle class person, that $8 difference adds up pretty quickly."
Language,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary."
Language,"So now I'm asking, whose responsibility is it to determine how much sugar is in a drink? Why is sugar so inexpensive to begin with? Do legislators have a responsibility there? Now we know it's not legal to bottle rat poison and sell it as tea, but whose responsibility is that? What isn't this author saying, and how does not saying it serve their argument? They're not saying what the government could or should do, only what it shouldn't do."
Language,"And this is why I want you to be skeptical whenever you read anyone's argument about anything. You need to figure out what the terms of the debate are. What does the argument assume as a given? What's a problem worth fixing? What are the trade offs that the writer thinks are acceptable? So when you encounter an argument in text, look for the claims, and then look to see if those claims are backed up with data-supported reasoning."
Language,"Is the author using evidence and logic? Do they anticipate objections to their arguments and push back on or incorporate those critiques? Above all else, I want you to remain skeptical. Everyone's selling something, even me. It's just the thing I'm trying to sell you is the fundamental idea that you can learn anything. You've got this, Readers. David out.."
Language,"At the time of this recording, I'm 31 and I run into new and confusing words every day. I read a lot and it's always a fun challenge to run into words like, I don't know, glabrous or limned or nacreous. I know a lot about language and even I have trouble figuring out what those words mean on their own. So it's important to rely on context, the language that surrounds the word. Let's say you're reading a text and you come across a sentence that has a word in it you don't recognize."
Language,"Here's a bit from a passage about the famous chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. ""Jane Goodall arrived at Tanzania's ""Gombee Stream National Park in 1960. ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers. ""After all, she had not yet been to college."" So let's pause on unconventional. What does that word mean? Well, let me give you some ideas, that's the memory aid I use to keep it straight."
Language,"IDEAS, it stands for inference, definition, example, antonym, synonym, I-D-E-A-S, IDEAS, which are all different kinds of context clues. Every word will have a different context, so you might need to vary your approach. The way this snippet is written let's try inference first, then I'll rewrite the sentence a few times to show you the other methods. Okay, the I in IDEAS, inference. We can draw conclusions from the context."
Language,"If we don't know what unconventional means, we can take a look at the rest of the sentence or other nearby sentences to figure it out. Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal."
Language,"And because I'm making an inference about this word's meaning I wanna keep an eye out for it in other places to see if I can confirm or revise that working definition later. D - definition. Context clues like these will just give you the definition of the word in question. So a good example of that would be: ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers."
Language,"""She hadn't been to college yet, ""and this made her different and unexpected."" Different and unexpected is a great definition for the word unconventional. This style of context clue occurs when the author expects a word to be unfamiliar to you and builds in a guide for you right there in the text. The E in IDEAS stands for example, and this is somewhere between inference and definition. If the author describes Goodall as unconventional, they'll go on to talk about something unconventional that Goodall did."
Language,"""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among animal researchers. ""For one thing, she hadn't been to college yet."" So this is very similar to that initial sentence, except for the transition phrase for one thing, which is a way to set up examples. Antonym - an antonym is a word whose meaning is the opposite of another word, like how night is the opposite of day, or how love is the opposite of hate."
Language,"So if there's an example in the text of what Jane Goodall was not, we can use that to figure out what she was. So let's say the passage said: ""Goodall was unconventional. ""She didn't conform, and she wasn't ordinary."" There we have two antonyms and our answer. Similarly, synonym just means write another word with the same meaning similar to a definition. ""Jane Goodall was unconventional. ""She was a nonconformist."
Language,"""She went against the grain."" You can see that I had to rewrite the sentences each time to apply to each context clue strategy, which shows me that you won't find all five context clues every time you need to search for a word's meaning. You need to find the approach that makes the most sense in context. See what I did there, ah huh? And failing that, you can always look up an unfamiliar word in a dictionary. I love to do that."
Language,"I think that's great, but I also feel a sense of victory when I correctly figure out what a new word means, when I've put it together from context. And maybe if I'm still curious, I look it up later and then I turn out to be right, and I'm all like ""Victory at sea, I did it!"" Oh, and if you were curious, glabrous means smooth and hairless like a leaf or the skin of a frog. Nacreous means shiny and rainbow colored like the inside of an oyster shell."
Language,"And to limn something means to draw the outline of or to be highlighted in light. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I'm not gonna say that you need to be able to speak modern Greek or read ancient Latin in order to understand English but many complicated words are made up of little language building blocks that we can break apart, using the power of understanding! (explosion) That was cool right? I'm cool? I'm cool. I'm gonna introduce some vocabulary about vocabulary now, so brace yourselves. There's this idea of a root word. Take the word dent, which is Latin for tooth."
Language,"From that root word, we can get the adjective dental, which means about teeth, or the noun dentist, which means a person who specializes in teeth, or the noun dentures, which are false teeth. That's what a root is. Now you can also combine roots to make words. The word phot is Greek for light, the root graph comes from the Greek for writing. You put those together, you get photograph or writing with light. It's kind of poetic, isn't it? To this understanding, let us add the idea of an affix."
Language,"Affixes aren't words or roots but they are word particles that convey meaning. Maybe you've heard of prefixes and suffixes, if you have, these are both types of affixes. Prefixes attach at the front end of a word, whereas suffixes attach at the back end. An example of a suffix would be logy, meaning the study of or the science of."
Language,"So we can make a bunch of words with logy, like biology, that's supposed to be a little amoeba; cetology, the study or science of whales; anthropology, the study of human beings; cosmology, the study of the universe. So if you see a logy, it's going to be some kind of science or specialized area of study. A good example of a prefix would be the Greek para, which means alongside."
Language,"So a paralegal is someone who works alongside lawyers, a paramedic works alongside doctors and if your house is haunted, you don't need a normal pest control expert to get rid of the ghost, you need a paranormal pest control expert, one that is alongside but not within normalcy and thus, you call the Ghostbusters. So what does all of this mean for you as a reader? Well when I encounter a word I don't understand, it's like I had been walking down a hallway and was suddenly confronted with a locked door."
Language,"It's frustrating but the magic, the power of studying roots, prefixes and suffixes is that when you master a small handful of them, you suddenly become the proud owner of a ring of keys. Doors fling themselves open for you, you can go anywhere, you can understand any concept, any piece of vocabulary. An army of locked doors fall off their hinges all at once when you approach. Don't believe me? I'll show you. While excavating the foundation for a geothermal plant, my companion Neha found a fossil."
Language,"Upon closer inspection, she realized it was a pterodactyl. Wow, lot of big words in that little paragraph. Now, watch this. Excavating, so hollowing out. Foundation, bottom-making. Geothermal, Earth heat. Companion, so this is someone you would eat bread with, so bread together, who do we eat bread together with? Our friends. Inspection, looking in or closer and pterodactyl, pter means wing, dactyl means finger, it is a prehistoric winged reptile."
Language,"So while she was digging in the ground to prepare the bottom of a plant that gets electricity from the heat of the Earth, my friend Neha found a fossil. When she looked at it closely, she realized it was a flying reptile with fingery wings. Do you see what I mean about keys? Studying roots and affixes gives me the power to look at those words and crack them apart. You're not so big now, vocabulary word. You have no power over me! Studying roots, prefixes and suffixes will give you that same power."
Language,"I promise you it is awesome, like, literally it fills me with a sense of awe. The power is yours for the taking. You can learn anything, David out. Okay are we doing those fun history reasons though? Okay, the short version is that first the Romans then some Vikings, then some French Vikings invaded the island of Great Britain a bunch of times over the last 1500 years, shaping the language and making what I like to call French-shaped dents in the Germanic structure of English."
Language,"English is a Germanic language, French is a Romance language, meaning not that it is full of love but that it is an offshoot of Latin or you know, Roman. French took root in 11th Century English and merged with it, grafting an enormous amount of Greek and Latin vocabulary on to a German root stock. We often reach for Latin and Greek compounds when we compose new words, which is why we say television in English, which comes from the Greek tele, meaning far away, and the Latin vire, meaning to see."
Language,"If we reached for Germanic roots to make new words, we'd call a television a farseer because indeed, that's what the word is in German, fernsehen. So why do we have Greek and Latin in our vocabulary? Because England was colonized by French speakers almost a thousand years ago. Imagine what English will sound like in another thousand years. Anyway, thanks for coming on this tangent with me. David out for real this time, bye.."
Language,"Tone communicates how an author feels about the topic they're writing about, this can come across in a number of different ways, it can reflect their enthusiasm or skepticism, it can also communicate formality or informality, an academic paper or a speech before the UN, for example are very different things from a toast at a wedding or a thank you card for a birthday gift and this kind of difference in tone is something that sociologists and linguists call register."
Language,"Social conventions and customs call for different registers in different circumstances, just as it would be inappropriate in most situations to wear a tuxedo at the beach, so too would it be incongruous to use extremely formal language in an informal setting? (melodic orchestral music) (clearing throat) Dear honored sir, it was the privilege of my very life to have you attend my 14th birthday party. I am grateful beyond words for your most generous gift, a check for $36 American."
Language,"Your humble and obedient servant, David. In fact using extremely formal language and high-minded gratitude for something as relatively small as a birthday gift might even come across as sarcastic or insulting. But this is sort of an extreme example, let's pull back and discuss how an understanding of tone can aid you in making sense of informational texts."
Language,"One great way to do that is to analyze word choice, we can look at a writer's language and determine their attitude towards the subject based on the words they've chosen to describe it. Oceans of ink have been spilled over comparisons between a Chicago style hotdog and a New York style hotdog. The first with its garden's worth of toppings, but a holier than now prohibition of ketchup, the latter with its sauerkraut, mustard and dubious dirty water cooking style."
Language,"But scant attention, a droplet of ink before the ocean has been paid to the half-smoke, the unsung but mighty regional sausage of Washington DC. Now how does the author think about the subject? Well, we know that they think that not enough writing has been done about DC's regional sausage, the half-smoke, but how do they feel about it? How do the words they use express their feelings? Let's break it down bit by bit."
Language,"So right out of the gate, we have oceans of ink, this is a deliberate piece of overstatement, there are no literal oceans made of ink, but it's being set up in opposition to the droplet of ink used to describe half-smokes later in the paragraph."
Language,"Half-smokes are described as unsung, but mighty, which suggests that they haven't been given their due, there hasn't been enough praise for half-smokes and that therefore the amount of attention given to Chicago and New York hotdogs is unfair or even disproportionate. I think we can also determine from word choice, that the author thinks a Chicago hot dog is a little ridiculous and that a New York hot dog is a little gross."
Language,"How do we know this? Chicagoans generally don't like ketchup on their hotdogs and the way the author phrases this is by saying, that they have a holier than thou prohibition on ketchup, which is to say they get all haughty and upset about it, which is weird because it's ketchup, listen, I'm a Chicagoan by birth, I used to feel this way and I'm not even sure why."
Language,"Similarly the word dubious in the description of the New York hotdog, meaning doubtful suggests that the dirty water cooking method is kind of nasty sounding, why would the author do this? Is it to say these are terrible hot dogs and nobody should eat them? No, I don't think so, The author is trying to make room for the half-smoke in the national sausage conversation and to do that, they're first trying to dismantle the importance of New York and Chicago style by making fun of them."
Language,"These are tactical choices, not to be confused with authorial voice, which is a different concept entirely an author's voice is their style, it's much more consistent across topics, whereas a tone is specific to a topic. So I might have an authorial voice, that uses a lot of goofy wordplay, but I use a sympathetic tone to talk about bears and a hostile tone to talk about, I don't know, whales, yeah, boo whales, I said it. I do not actually hate whales, I love whales."
Language,"But my point is this, use your knowledge of words, of the connotation and implications of the language, that an author might use to unlock your understanding of their tone, because if you can do that, my friend, you can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Hey, what's up readers? David here. I'm taking advantage of the cold that I have by doing my serious detective voice in order to teach you about inferences. (phone ringing) Hold on, let me get that. Hi, this is David. I'm in the middle of doing a video. Now isn't a great time. - [Man On Phone] Hello, I have information about what an inference is. -    Oh, oh that's great. Cool, follow me over to the next screen."
Language,"What is an inference, please? - [Man On Phone] An inference is a conclusion that you make based on clues given in a piece of writing. It's more than a guess, but it's not just an observation either. -    Great, thank you. Was that all you needed? - [Man On Phone] Yeah, that was my only thing. -    All right, thanks, bye. - [Man On Phone] Goodbye. -    So an inference is a conclusion that you draw from writing."
Language,"It's an idea that you pull from a sentence or a passage that isn't literally printed there. It's the detective work of reading, finding clues that help you make sense of what's being said. I feel like we're kind of getting bogged down in theory land so let's take a look at an example. I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. There's my snow fort. It's a D on the flag to represent me. There's me little hot cocoa, couple marshmallows floating in there, my Khan Academy mug."
Language,"They don't make Khan Academy mugs. I want a Khan Academy mug. Okay, so what conclusions can we draw from these two sentences? I went outside and made an enormous snow fort. Beautiful, brilliant, enormous. Then I came inside and had a big mug of hot chocolate. Same deal, brilliant, beautiful, enormous. What conclusions can I draw about this situation? Well if you're making things out of snow and then you're coming inside and having hot chocolate, it's probably not the height of summer."
Language,"One inference that I can draw from these two sentences together is that it is winter time when this sentence takes place. Where I live, these are not activities that one pursues in the height of summer outside. I'm looking for clues within the text. Snow fort, I'm outside, I came inside and then I had hot chocolate which is not traditionally a beverage that is consumed when it's warm out. Let's take a look at another example."
Language,"This paragraph is part of a longer passage that is about a young ballet dancer named Michaela. Michaela danced so wonderfully that she was awarded a scholarship to attend the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School at the American Ballet Theater. That was only the beginning of her dancing success. When she was 17, Michaela danced with the Dance Theater of Harlem professional company. Later, she joined the Dutch National Junior Company. Today, Michaela is a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet."
Language,"So very quickly without getting bogged down in this passage, what are some conclusions, what are some inferences that we can draw about Michaela? Who is Michaela? What do we know about her? We know that she's a dancer. We know that she's very good at it, right? She danced so wonderfully that she got a scholarship. So I'm gonna say Michaela is very talented and we know that her talent led to success because her getting the scholarship was only the beginning of her dancing success."
Language,"We can see from the passage that she was part of at least three different dance companies, the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Dutch National Junior Company, and as a soloist with the Dutch National Ballet today. So I'm gonna say that Michaela is a very hard worker. Now notice no where in the passage does it say Michaela is a very talented, hard working dancer. Just like in the previous example, it didn't say, it was winter outside so I made a snow fort."
Language,"What the skill of inference is requires you to be a detective and take your magnifying glass to the passage to discover clues. Imagine you're a detective like this dog. He's wearing a little deer stalker cap. Let's call him, let's call him Sherlock Bones, the famous dog detective that I just made up. I feel like Sherlock Holmes is always smoking a pipe so I'm gonna give this dog like a, I don't know a bone or a piece of rawhide or something."
Language,"Imagine that you are a detective or a dog detective if you like and every time you read a text, let's say a book, that you are searching for clues within it. What you're doing when you make an inference is you are taking the information that you already know about the world and the places and people in it and how they behave and what they look like and what they do and you're applying that knowledge to the text."
Language,"When do people build snowmen? When do people build snow forts? When do they drink hot cocoa? In the winter time. An important thing to remember though is that inferring is not guessing. Any time you make an inference, you have to be pulling it directly from the text. That's your jumping off point. It can't just be a wild guess out of no where. It comes from information that you've got there on the page. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go eat my weight in cough drops."
Language,"You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"What, your saying, how do you map a story? What makes a story pointy? These are great questions, and to answer them, I'll say this, today we're going to talk about the elements of a story, or the parts that make it up, like ingredients in a recipe. Many stories follow a similar pattern. Good readers know what these patterns are, and can talk about them using the right terms. And this helps everyone be on the same page, so to speak, when you discuss or write about the stories you read."
Language,"I'm about to drop a lot of vocabulary on you, so brace yourselves. The story begins with exposition, where we learn about the characters and the setting. Then, we introduce a conflict, or a big problem. As the characters begin to interact with the conflict or try to solve the problem, we enter rising action. This upward slope of the story mountain. When the conflict comes to a head, we hit the most exciting part of the story, the climax. Here, the conflict can't go any further."
Language,"We're at the top of the mountain. There's nowhere else to go, except down. After the climax, after this most exciting part of the story, we enter falling action. The climax will happen much closer to the end of the story than to the middle. It's not a symmetrical mountain. The action slows down. The problem has been solved, or maybe the problem has changed, and the characters prepare for the last phase of story, the resolution."
Language,"This is where we tie up loose ends, characters reflect on what they learned, maybe you set up a sequel. Now, look, that was a lot of information all at once. In order to make sense of it, let's apply all of those terms to a story."
Language,"Now, our go-to has been the Three Little Pigs, and while that's a story everyone knows, I'm starting to think it needs to be freshened up a little bit, really working its franchise potential, you know? So let's go through the elements of story by looking at my new project, a reboot of Three Little Pigs that I'm calling TLP: Starbound. See, it's Three Little Pigs, but it's in space. That's a space helmet. So I'm gonna put a little story map here in the corner. Okay, so the exposition. It's the future."
Language,"Pigs have expanded to every corner of the galaxy. Three brave little pigs decide to strike out on their own, exploring a new, exciting region of space. One builds a spaceship out of straw. Go with me here. One builds a spaceship out of twigs. And one builds a spaceship out of flexible hyper alloy they developed in a laboratory. She's the brainy pig. So, we've got the setting. It's the future, they're in space. We've got our characters, the pigs. Now, the conflict."
Language,"Along comes the notorious space pirate, Captain Wolf. He's big, he's bad, he wants to blow up the spaceships and eat the pigs. He begins hunting down the pig ships, one at a time. Think Captain Wolf has an eye patch? No, he has a cyber eye; he's part robot. And now we enter our rising action phase. Captain Wolf engages the straw ship. They have an exciting space battle. (instructor making shooting noises) And straw pig escapes in the little escape pod to the twig ship! But Captain Wolf follows."
Language,"He is undaunted. The tension continues to rise. He destroys the twig ship! (instructor making shooting noises) The two pigs escape again, this time to the brick house. I mean, the flexible hyper alloy spaceship, piloted by the science pig. And now, we come to the climax. Captain Wolf comes to the advanced ship. He tries to blow it up, but he can't! It's too powerful. He decides to board the ship, because that's the only way he'll get to eat the pigs."
Language,"But the pigs trap him in a space barrel while he's still in the airlock. They did it! They solved the problem. Captain Wolf is trapped in a space barrel, and he can't eat them now. The climax is passed, and now we enter the falling action phase of the story. In the version of the story that I know, the three little pigs roll the barrel in to the river."
Language,"So I think maybe in this version they punt the space barrel out the airlock in to the cold void of space! Or maybe they strand him on a deserted planet, but in any case, they never have to deal with the wolf again. The threat is now gone. And that means that the conflict has been resolved. We're in the resolution part of the story now. The first two little pigs, the straw ship pig and the twig ship pig, learned that they need to put more work in to their spaceships if they wanna survive in space."
Language,"And they build fancy spaceships just like the science pig. And that's an introduction to story elements. Now that you're familiar with the ideas, start applying them to your favorite stories. You can do this with any form of media: books, comics, TV shows, movies, games. What's the conflict? How is it resolved? Once you start looking for story structure in entertainment, you will find it everywhere. Let us now what you see. You can learn anything; David, out.."
Language,"You'll notice it has almost no words in it, at least in this form. Now, let me show you the script. Pages three and four, panel one. A double-page spread, the whole greenhouse revealed, in widescreen. It's glorious. Wisps of steam curl up from bubbling patches of pool, green kelpy tendrils twine up the sides of the building. Everything is suffused with a delicate, green glow. Absent the gro-lights, some of the algae fluoresce in a range of cool-spectrum colors. But primarily greens."
Language,"Eugene is dwarfed by its almost cosmic magnificence. Caption, I can't describe it. None of that language, except for the caption, shows up in the final layout. All of that was me, the writer, giving art direction to Cour, the illustrator. Then they translated that language into their own version. I think it's a pretty faithful translation. My words are translated through Cour's design sensibilities and turned into artwork."
Language,"When you translate a written work into a different medium, whether it's illustrated, animated, recorded, or performed live it changes. It becomes a fundamentally different object. As readers, it's a valuable skill to explore how a text changes as it shifts from one medium to another. And when I say, medium, I mean a style of work, like a stage play, a film, a graphic novel, and audio drama, any of that. Good readers analyze those changes and use them to understand decisions that creators make."
Language,"If you're watching Romeo and Juliet and the director has made the decision to dress everyone in towering robot suits, a detail that is definitely not in the play as written, what does that decision tell you? What does it mean to you? Maybe you have had the experience of reading a book series that was important to you and then they made it into a movie and you were so excited to see the movie, and you sat down to see it and it was awful."
Language,"Like, they cast the wrong actors and they simplified the plot until it made no sense, and it just didn't feel right. That feeling is an example of this tension, this change, between a written material and its visual adaptation. Sometimes it can be bad, sometimes it can be good. Some readers can imagine what characters in books look or sound like, hearing them in their mind's ear, seeing them in their mind's eye."
Language,"The way your imagination renders a character is going to be different from how someone else's imagination does it. So let's compare the script for this audio drama we've got on Khan Academy, Hands Off My Phone, and let's compare that against the recorded version. So first, I'm going to put up the script and I'd like you to pause the video and just read it to yourself very quickly. And now let's take a listen to the recorded version. (upbeat music) (bell ringing) - [Sebastian] Oh no he didn't."
Language,"That is so harsh. - [Valentina] Right? - [Sebastian] Your dad took your phone away, just for getting a D on the history test? - [Valentina] Yep. - [Sebastian] My mind is blown. - [Valentina] Mine too. - [Sebastian] I mean, that was an easy test. - [Valentina] What? - [Sebastian] I can't believe you got a D. - [Valentina] Hey! That's not really-- - [Sebastian] And your dad is the school principal, and he took your phone away. Whoa. (chuckling) - [Valentina] You know, this isn't really helping."
Language,"- [Sebastian] Your life is so bleak right now. -    So you can read that script and think, oh hey, Sebastian is being earnestly sympathetic. Like, he really recognizes that his friend is hurting, but when you hear that performance the way I interpreted this line is that Sebastian is low-key roasting Valentina. He's not saying your life is so bleak in a kind way. He's rubbing salt into the wounds and being a dingus about it."
Language,"There's also other stuff that's not explicitly in the script like, that opening musical sting. (upbeat music) And the ringing of the bell. (bell ringing) Or those background school noises. All of that is meant to represent the fact that you're listening to a fictional show that takes place in a school setting. Does it work? That's for you to decide. When you watch or listen to a performance or a recording, or when you look at illustrations, ask yourself some questions."
Language,"For an audio piece, how do the sound effects, the acting decisions, and the music impact the story or affect the meaning of the words the characters say? How does the way an actor delivers a line change its emphasis? Was someone being sarcastic or sincere in a way you didn't expect, for example? For an illustrated story, how do those illustrations help you understand the author's tone and do you agree with those choices? Is the author's interpretation of the story the same as yours? For a TV show, or a movie, or a play, in addition to all the decisions made by actors about how to use their voices, shape their faces, or hold their bodies, how does the set tell the story? How do costumes tell the story? How does lighting or special effects impact the tone? For TV and film, how does the camera impact the way the story is told? The way a piece of film text is edited, its cuts, its angles, its rhythms, can help shape the way you, as a viewer, as a reader of visual text, understand it."
Language,"And if you can learn that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"using details from a text to make inferences, aren't you? - [Sherlock Bones] Yes, my boy! It's simplicity itself. But first, let me deduce a few things about you, shall I? -    Well, Mr. Bones, we're trying to do this about writing, not about people, so... - [Bones] Give me your hand. -    Waugh! - [Bones] Ah, you like to cook, you have a nervous disposition and you work for Khan Academy."
Language,"-    Now how did you know that? - [Bones] You have a callus on your finger from how you hold a knife, your fingernails are bitten, not clipped and your messenger bag says Khan Academy. -    Well and I told you who I was before I showed up. - [Bones] That too. -    But what does this have to do with reading a book? - [Bones] I correctly deduced several truths about your person based on clues, my good David. Indeed, all inference is making sense of clues."
Language,"When you read a story, you are constantly making inferences. -    I see. Okay, I'll read a passage and then see what I can make of it. An hour later, thick smoke poured up the stairs. The smoke detector screamed and I could hear Uncle Paleo stumbling around with the fire extinguisher. When he came upstairs afterward, his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. He was a wreck, broken glasses, black smudges on his face and singed hair."
Language,"Okay, so I can surmise that there was some kind of fire or explosion downstairs, where the character Uncle Paleo was. - [Bones] Hm, how do you know? -    Well his hair was singed, that's another word for burned and his face was covered in black smudges like you get from soot from a fire and there was all the smoke and the smoke detector went off. - [Bones] And there is also the matter of the fire extinguisher. -    Also that. - [Bones] I see something else in that passage too."
Language,"-    What's that, Mr. Bones? - [Bones] Uncle Paleo was exhausted by putting out the fire. -    How can you tell? Where does it say that? - [Bones] Well, it doesn't. That's inference, my lad. Note here how it said his footsteps sounded slow and heavy. Why might that be? -    He stepped in something sticky. No, oo, he's wearing shoes made of lead. - [Bones] Well, those are indeed possible explanations but you want to think of the most likely option."
Language,"-    He was running around to put the fire out and it made him tired. - [Bones] So, you were reading between the lines, were you? Drawing conclusions from the text? -    I was. So we know for sure Uncle Paleo was tired, right? - [Bones] WE DO NOT, SIR. -    Oh!! - [Bones] An inference is only one possible conclusion but is not the only conclusion. -    So what are we to do? - [Bones] The more clues you discover, the stronger your inferences will become."
Language,"You have to look at what you already know about a character, about the setting of the story, the events of a story's plot and piece it together from there. You know that fires create lots of black dust or soot so it strengthens your argument in favor of a fire. And it's background knowledge like that, about the way the world works that will serve you as a reader and as a maker of inferences. Apply what you know to the world of the story and make inferences based on that."
Language,"-    And then, I can become the world's greatest consulting detective? - [Bones] You can become like the world's 50th greatest consulting detective, top of the heap's rather full, I'm afraid. -    Well, thank you for your time today, Mr. Bones. Best of luck with your case work. - [Bones] Thank you; I shan't need it. (barks) -    You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"And sometimes that purpose will be harder to see. As readers, our job is to consider the author's purpose as we read. How is it influencing the information the author shares? How is it influencing my understanding of the topic? Is what I think the same as what the author thinks? Do I agree with them? Do I disagree? You may be familiar with the memory device of P.I.E., persuade, inform, entertain, as three categories of purpose. But I'd like to go deeper than that."
Language,"I live in Washington, D.C., which is home to an entire professional class of what are called lobbyists, people whose job it is to advocate to Congress on behalf of a special interest, for example, the oil industry or the cheese industry. This isn't always bad. You can learn more about lobbyists and advocates in Khan Academy's Government and Politics course. But frequently, it takes the form of someone from an industry trying to convince Congress to give them a competitive advantage over other industries."
Language,"Now, let's pull real-world politics out of this and pretend for the purposes of this lesson that there are two warring lobbying groups in D.C. One that represents the cake industry, and another that represents the pie industry. An age-old conflict. So hold that conflict in your mind for a second, cake versus pie. Now, when we read informational text, we should be learning new information. But the author's opinions can shape the text to the point where the information becomes biased or misleading."
Language,"When you read informational text, maintain an air of healthy skepticism. Ask yourself the following questions constantly. What's the author's opinion? What information did they include, or what information did they leave out? And if so, was that on purpose? What's the connotation of the author's word choice? You know, how do the words feel? And what's the overall tone of the piece? So now we have these questions to ask ourselves, let's return to our pie versus cake lobby fight in Washington."
Language,"So imagine you're reading ""The Washington Post,"" and you see this opinion column. ""Cake Connected to Cavities ""and Poor Dental Health, Study Finds."" ""A recent study by the American Dental Association ""connected the consumption of cake or similar foods ""with a 30% increased risk of tooth decay, ""cavities, and gingivitis. ""People who reported having consumed cake ""in the previous 60 days were significantly more likely ""to experience problems related to dental health ""than those people who did not."
Language,"""Cake is dangerous. ""Cake, which rarely contains fruit, will rot your teeth."" And then if we squint down at the very bottom of the column, it'll say in small text, ""The author is the CEO ""of Circular Solutions, a pie-advocacy network."" And now let's ask ourselves those same questions again while acknowledging that this is a fake story that I made up for the purposes of this video. There is nobody named Wendell Apricotjam, although I wish there were, that'd be a great name."
Language,"So, what's the author's opinion? Well, it seems to me that the author really thinks cake is dangerous and poses a threat to the nation's dental health. We know this because they literally say ""cake is dangerous."" They want people to buy and eat fewer cakes. What information did the author choose to include? Well, so this is interesting."
Language,"The author talks about the results of this study and the big takeaways about the danger of cake or similar foods, and then they go on to mention incidentally that cake rarely contains fruit. That's a curious thing to say. It's almost like they're saying, ""Pie, which has fruit in it, is better for you than cake,"" without actually saying it."
Language,"What information did the author choose to leave out? Well, notice that the piece says ""cake or similar foods."" I would be hard-pressed to come up with a definition of foods similar to cake that does not also include desserts like pie. But the way that this piece is written, it swerves out of its way to avoid pinning the same tooth decay risks on pie the way that it blames cake."
Language,"I think it would be reasonable to assume that if we read the underlying study that this opinion piece is based on, it would include pies and cakes in the same category of sugary desserts that are associated with bad dental outcomes. Why would the author do this? Well, they want you to buy pie instead of cake. But they don't want you to think too hard about it because if you did, you would buy and eat both less cake and less pie. And the pie lobby doesn't want that."
Language,"What's the connotation or the feeling of the author's word choices? Well, they're citing a scientific study by dentists, so they want you to take their warning seriously, and they're using words like risk and danger, rot and problems. They want you to make an association between eating cake and bad tooth health. They want you to associate scientific language with trustworthiness. So I'm gonna put down scientific authority here. What's the overall tone? It's negative."
Language,"The author does not want you to eat cake. They want you to think it's bad, and they've planted a little hint here that fruity foods are better. And what's a fruity food? Can they say pie is safer? No, not without lying outright. Now, I wanna be clear about two things. Sometimes an author's purpose really will just be to inform straightforwardly. Not everything has to be a tug-of-war between you and the author over the truth."
Language,"Sometimes a writer just wants you to know the lifecycle of a butterfly, or how to make egg salad, or the order the U.S. presidents came in. But most of the time, there's a purpose, an opinion, behind the text. Now, the second thing I wanna be super clear about is that I made up this whole thing. I made up the article, the statistics, Wendell, you know, all of that's fake. I like both pie and cake very much."
Language,"And now that I've said that, I'm sure you're wondering, ""Oh, is David in the pocket of big dessert?"" And the answer is no. I'm in the pocket of big free education for everyone everywhere. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"""This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why."" Argument does not sneak, it does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories: data, fact, observable reality. There is a place for pure subjective opinion, and it is the realm of the movie and the restaurant review."
Language,"""I did not like this movie because I didn't laugh at its jokes."" ""I did not enjoy the hamburger I got because I found it too dry for my liking."" This is not what we're talking about today. Obviously, argument is rooted in opinion and subjective personal preferences, but those opinions need to be backed up with evidence. Let's compare arguments for and against a tax on soda."
Language,"Now, this writer argues that sugar contributes to obesity, and therefore, people should be prevented from buying soda, which is full of sugar on the grounds that it is bad for them, let's take a look. The soda tax could alter many people's behavior, causing them to stop buying sugary drinks. Some foods are necessities like milk, eggs, and bread. People will buy them even if the prices increase. Sugary drinks aren't necessary."
Language,"If the price goes up, people will buy fewer sugary drinks and they won't be consuming as much sugar, therefore, the obesity rate will go down. Whereas this author counters that people have a right to make what they see as unhealthy decisions. Soda and other sugary drinks have been targeted because they lack nutrition and are basically just liquid sugar. Most people would agree that proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
Language,"However, do legislators have the right or responsibility to regulate people's sugar intake in order to improve their health? I say, no. All right, let's evaluate these claims. For the first argument in favor of the soda tax, how do we know this is true? What evidence does this author give that this tax will alter people's behavior? What evidence does this author give that sugary drinks aren't seen to be as essential as milk? After all, not everyone can or does drink milk."
Language,"In the piece, the evidence that the author gives us is this table, which shows how much sugar is in soda per serving, but it doesn't use evidence to connect sugar consumption to unhealthy outcomes. All this says is, soda has a lot of sugar. I wanna see evidence, I wanna see studies. How do we know this tax would change behavior? Good readers think through the impacts of an argument."
Language,"If this tax went into effect, what would the consequences be? Are there faults in the author's logic? It might stop some people from buying soda, but in an unfair way. Here's how I'm processing this as a reader. If you take a bottle of soda that previously costs, say $2, and the tax makes it $10, that will make it more difficult to purchase. But to a millionaire, the difference between $2 and $10 is basically nothing. Whereas to a poor or middle class person, that $8 difference adds up pretty quickly."
Language,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary."
Language,"So now I'm asking, whose responsibility is it to determine how much sugar is in a drink? Why is sugar so inexpensive to begin with? Do legislators have a responsibility there? Now we know it's not legal to bottle rat poison and sell it as tea, but whose responsibility is that? What isn't this author saying, and how does not saying it serve their argument? They're not saying what the government could or should do, only what it shouldn't do."
Language,"And this is why I want you to be skeptical whenever you read anyone's argument about anything. You need to figure out what the terms of the debate are. What does the argument assume as a given? What's a problem worth fixing? What are the trade offs that the writer thinks are acceptable? So when you encounter an argument in text, look for the claims, and then look to see if those claims are backed up with data-supported reasoning."
Language,"Is the author using evidence and logic? Do they anticipate objections to their arguments and push back on or incorporate those critiques? Above all else, I want you to remain skeptical. Everyone's selling something, even me. It's just the thing I'm trying to sell you is the fundamental idea that you can learn anything. You've got this, Readers. David out.."
Language,"I legitimately wrote a book about this a few years ago, and to research this book about the world's deadliest animals, I read a lot of other books and sources. So I wanna use this experience to show you why it's important to read more than one source on a subject. Okay, so why do it? Why not say all right, I read one text about the Pacific Blue-ringed octopus. Why do I need to read two or three or 20? There are a couple reasons. Let's start with the first, expert knowledge."
Language,"If you wanna know all about octopuses, you can't just look at a single piece of writing say, ""Bam, got it, know all I need to know ""I am the knower of octopus facts."" No, you can't do it. If you want to become an expert, you need to be able to say well, this book says the Pacific octopus toxin can stop your heart. But this one says that you can tell whether or not an octopus is frightened by its color. Reason number two to read multiple sources, helping to determine or know what's true."
Language,"Sometimes people get things wrong. It helps to read more than one text to make sure you're getting as many perspectives or ideas as you can. Sometimes information from an old book might be outdated or information from a new book hasn't yet been proven to be true. Reading different texts can help you decide what you think about a topic, or even whether or not something is true."
Language,"We can answer questions like, what is the deadliest animal? Or how do we even define deadliest? Reason number three, to read multiple texts on the same topic, supporting an argument. The more information you can get about a topic, the more support you can give to your own opinions or arguments. I think that this animal is the most dangerous because I've read a bunch of different works about dangerous animals and I can support it with evidence, you would say."
Language,"If I were to say that bears are more dangerous than I don't really know what I drew, I thought I was trying to draw a sheep but I think it's a hedgehog. If I were to try to argue that bears are more dangerous than hedgehogs, I would use multiple sources to provide evidence for those claims. Bears are taller, bears are heavier, bears have sharper teeth, bears are stronger. Hedgehogs or sheep are cuter and cuddlier sorry to bears."
Language,"It's important to recognize that different books have different arguments in them. Every book has a different angle, right? Sometimes it's obvious like a book with the title, ""Deadly animals and how to hunt them"" versus a book called ""Deadly animals and how to protect their habitats."" People have opinions and people make books. So, that means that books can have opinions too."
Language,"Are these animals cool or terrifying? Should they be hunted or protected? Reading one text on a subject doesn't give you the full story. It's important to be able to read more than one text, compare them and then decide what you think from that. It helps to have a purpose in mind too as you read. Oh, and to answer your unspoken question, the deadliest animals on earth are definitely human beings but in a close second place is hippos. Those guys will bite you in half. So you know, watch out for hippos."
Language,You can learn anything. David out..
Language,"How do we know that though? How did J. R. R. Tolkien, as an author, develop that theme in the text? How can we go deeper, beyond that headline of the Ring equals the dangers of absolute power? Good readers can look at a whole text from beginning to end and identify where the author purposefully chose words, included details, or directed action that develops or reveals the overall theme."
Language,"It's not just that characters say, ""Oh, no, the Ring's super-dangerous."" In fact, I believe in ""The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf says, ""No, with that power, ""I should have power too great and terrible. ""And over me, the Ring could gain a power ""still greater and more deadly. ""Do not tempt me!"" The characters say that, they do, but it's also about how they behave around the thing."
Language,"It's how the plot is shaped around this object and how a group of people come together to identify this Ring as a dangerous, magical artifact that needs to be destroyed for the good of the world. It's not just dialogue. It's also descriptions by the author and actions taken by the characters."
Language,"So let's go through some of the ways that an author can develop theme within a story, with the important caveat that you won't always be able to detect a theme in a text until you're already finished reading it for the first time. This, to me, is one of the great pleasures of rereading. You've already worked hard to get an understanding of the text, so now you can go back and pick up all the stuff you might not have noticed the first time."
Language,"So one way to develop theme is through the repeated use of a symbol or an object. The Ring in ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great example because characters are always talking about it. But it could really be anything, a design, an object, an animal. Imagine a story about a child who wants to grow up to be an engineer that develops airplanes. And throughout this story, birds keep showing up, birds on the protagonist's windowsill, her favorite teacher's bird earrings, maybe she has a best friend named Robin."
Language,"And from that, we can see the idea of flight is a theme in this story, and all of these bird-related things go back to this character's desire to take flight. Changes in setting are a fine way to develop themes. How is a location portrayed? How does it match with the way characters feel or behave when they appear in these locations? Imagine a character who desperately wants to be alone. So at a tense portion in the story, she flees to a distant mountaintop."
Language,"When she gets there, what's the weather like? Is it cold, snowy, and forbidding on the mountain? Is it an active volcano, bubbling with lava? Is it clear, peaceful, full of snowdrops and mountain goats? What would an author be trying to say with those decisions? How should we, the reader, feel about that character's solitude? If it's snowy and forbidding, is it a symbol of the character's coldness, of their hardening up? Does the volcano reflect the character's explosive potential? Or does the beauty of the lonely mountaintop mean this was the right decision for the character to take? Dialogue that repeatedly references a similar idea can be a way to develop theme."
Language,"When characters mention something a lot, it's probably because the author is thinking about it and maybe wanted to build it intentionally into the story. Imagine a teenager in Ancient Rome who's preoccupied with honor and his family name and how he's worried he won't live up to the achievements of his ancestors. If that's something that he's insecure about, he might think about it often or talk about the concept of honor or the social standing of his family."
Language,"You can also see this presented as explicit lessons by a sage character, usually older and wise. Think of Moana's grandmother or of Yoda. They'll say something explicit like, ""Go do the thing your heart wants, Moana,"" or, ""Trust that the energy of the universe ""will make you a really good space wizard, Luke."" I'm paraphrasing here. Or think of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" saying, ""There's no place like home."" She says it again and again. The words are so powerful that they're used as a magic spell."
Language,"And words so powerful that they become magic is really just another way to say theme. It doesn't need to be said aloud to be thematic. Some of the most powerful moments in storytelling come from action, not just dialogue. Momentous character decisions, like Maui giving up his powers to save Moana or Harry Potter's climactic battle with Voldemort, are chock-full of themes, self-sacrifice, the power of love, the importance of honesty. Some of these themes can be expressed without speaking a single word."
Language,"And I should be clear. Sometimes you need to finish the story before you can look back on it and understand how parts of it contribute to the theme. You might need to get some distance before you can see how all of the pieces fit together. If something really sticks with me, sometimes I like to go back and reread parts of a book once I've gotten a sense of its theme, to see how the author has threaded theme through the text."
Language,"Now, if you look very closely at the videos I make here at Khan Academy, if you really squint your eyes and listen carefully, you'll notice that all of them share the same theme, which is you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"I don't literally mean that I've got a bear. That would be extremely sweet. Love a bear, love bear's whole thing with the snacking and the sleeping and the eating of fish, but no. A bear of is a figurative expression that means something difficult. So a bear of a lesson is a difficult lesson and that's what we're talking about today. Not bears, sorry, but non-literal uses of language, which we call figurative language or figures of speech. Figurative language says one thing but means another."
Language,"I could say that my colleague Allison is an eagle-eyed editor and when I say that I don't mean that she literally has an eagle's eyes in her head. That would be a terrifying achievement of medical science. No, I'm saying that she is sharp and attentive in the same way that an eagle is. So I'm saying something that is not literally true in order to express something that is true, that Allison is good at editing. Would you call that a lie? I'm not sure I would."
Language,"It's just a non-literal way of expressing myself. So, having gotten the question of whether or not I'm a dirty rotten liar out of the way, let's talk about some different varieties of figurative language. First, the simile. A simile is a comparison between two things that uses like or as. If I were really hungry, I could say that my stomach was gurgling like a tar pit or that I was as hungry as a ravenous wolf, and again, neither of these things are literally true."
Language,"If my stomach were making actual tar pit noises, I would probably need to go to a hospital. But what do those examples tell you about the way that I, the speaker, think about my hunger? Animals and people get stuck in tar pits, they're gloppy, they pull things into them, they slow things down. Sorry T-Rex. Therefore, I'm saying that my hunger is slowing me down. Or, if I'm comparing myself to a wolf, you can imagine me looking lean and desperate, saliva dripping from my jaws at the mere thought of food."
Language,"I could really go for a cheese danish come to think of it. So that's simile. The second figure of speech I wanna talk about today is the metaphor. And what's a metaphor? Cows and sheep! Sorry, I couldn't help it. No, a metaphor is not a meadow for. Metaphors are another way of comparing two things, but this time there's no like or as. We're walking this language tightrope without a net now."
Language,"You aren't signaling with like or as that you're making a figurative comparison, so you have to use context to communicate clearly. At the beginning of this video I said this was going to be a bear of a lesson. That's a metaphor. There's a Linda Ronstadt country song from the 70s, called ""Love is a Rose,"" which is all about how to take care of a relationship through the metaphor of tending a flower with thorns on it."
Language,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person."
Language,"To say that differently, it's ascribing human characteristics to non-living things. The wind howled through the mountains. The car grumbled as I threw it into gear. The storm raged. These are things that people do, but I'm applying that language to inanimate things, like wind and cars and storms in order to express the way these things are behaving. The car is not literally grumbling, ""Aw man, I can't believe David has to drive me today."" It's making noises that I am choosing to identify as unhappy."
Language,"The greatest kind of figurative language in the entire universe is hyperbole. By exaggerating, I'm expressing emphasis and importance. This summer, I'm going to read a million books and eat a literal actual ton of hot dogs. This is not true. In fact, this is impossible. That is too many hot dogs, those are too many books, each of which are sentences I never expected to say, but I'm trying to express my enthusiasm for both books and encased meats, and I'm doing that by being, you know, extra."
Language,"The final kind of expressive language I wanna talk about today isn't exactly figurative language, it's the language of allusions and references. Where you make comparisons to characters or events from literature, or movies, or culture. Also note that it's allusion with an A, as opposed to illusion with an I. An illusion with an I is like a magic trick. Here are some examples of allusions. Oh, you'd have to be Superman to lift that fallen tree. Or, you have a Gollum-like obsession with that stuffed animal."
Language,"Now these comparisons only work if the person you're talking to understands the reference. Superman has super strength, Gollum, from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" can't stop talking about how much he loves this one object, the ring. If you don't know the reference, then it's all just noise. One tip is to read up on mythology. You'd be surprised how many times ancient gods, like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo come up as you read. So that's what we're working with here. Simile, love is like a rose."
Language,"Metaphor, love is a rose. Personification, my car grumbled. Hyperbole, my mom grounded me for eight trillion years. And allusion, I feel mightier than Hercules. That's figurative language folks. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"If ordinary writing is like talking, then poetry is like singing. Poetry is a way of making art with language. Poems can express huge ideas or feelings. They can be about the sound or rhythm of language, or they can be goofy, little jokes. It's like any other kind of writing. Poems can be about everything or they can be about nothing at all. They can be funny, or sad, or sweet. They can rhyme. They can very much not rhyme. And all of that is, in my opinion, absolutely wonderful."
Language,"I think of some poems as condensed ideas that contain a lot of ideas in small amounts of text. So every word matters a lot. There's a little light bulbs representing ideas. So I'm gonna look at a couple of poems today in order to describe some parts of a poem. Let's begin with the poem ""Cat"" by Marilyn Singer. It goes like this. I prefer warm fur, a perfect fire to lie beside a cozy lap, where I can nap, an empty chair when she's not there. I want heat on my feet, on my nose, on my hide."
Language,"No cat I remember dislikes December inside. So the person who wrote this poem, Marilyn singer, is the poet for stories. The person who writes the poem is an author, but for poems, the writer is a poet, but who is telling the poem? Who's speaking? The person whose voice we hear in a poem is called the speaker, which is another thing I like about poetry. When you're having trouble understanding a poem, read it aloud. Part of the pleasure of poetry for me is hearing the words bounce around as you say them."
Language,"And then this poem, I'm pretty sure the speaker is a cat. Now you'll notice there are only three sentences in this poem, but they're separated into 15 lines. You can see these lines have anywhere from one to four words in them. Lines can be as long or as short as a poet likes, but here the poet is creating these line breaks to indicate pauses and rhythms, right? Like normally we wouldn't start a new line here, if this were prose, which is what we call all other forms of writing."
Language,"Prose uses normal sentences and paragraphs, right? The poet is choosing to create line breaks in order to change the way the sentence or the line looks on the page. Poetry is not just about how it sounds. Sometimes it's about how it looks as it's written. Now, in addition, the poet is also using spaces to scoot these three phrases over as well as this word inside. The words themselves are scooted in. They're curled up and feeling cozy, like a cat by a fire in the middle of December."
Language,"You'll also notice that some but not all of the lines rhyme with each other. And let's take a moment to think for a second. What is rhyming really? One way to think about it is when the ending sound of a word matches the other ending sound of a word like lap and nap, or when a bunch of sounds match each other throughout a pair of words like remember, and December, I want to be super clear about this part because I was already out of high school before I learned this thing, but poems don't have to rhyme."
Language,"They can, but they definitely don't have to. I have one more poem part to describe to you. And to do it, I wanna use Billy Collins poem ""Litany"" which sounds like a fancy poem at first, but then becomes much more conversational. I'll end by reading the first three stanzas, which are these paragraph looking things. Not all poems are broken into stanzas, but this one is. So those are some parts of the poem. To review, a poet writes lines."
Language,"The place where each line ends is called a line break and a group of lines together in a paragraph is called a stanza. The voice that tells us the poem, the poem's narrator is called the speaker. Some poems rhyme, others don't. Here's a snippet of ""Litany"" by Billy Collins. Litany. You are the bread and the knife, the crystal goblet and the wine. You are the dew on the morning grass and the burning wheel of the sun. You are the white apron of the baker and the marsh birds suddenly in flight."
Language,"However, you are not the wind in the orchard, the plums on the counter, or the house of cards. And you are certainly not the pine scented air. There is just no way that you are the pine-scented air. It is possible that you are the fish under the bridge. Maybe even the pigeon on the General's head, but you are not even close to being the field of corn flowers at dusk. There's more, but I'd love it if you looked it up and read it aloud yourself. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"You'll notice it has almost no words in it, at least in this form. Now, let me show you the script. Pages three and four, panel one. A double-page spread, the whole greenhouse revealed, in widescreen. It's glorious. Wisps of steam curl up from bubbling patches of pool, green kelpy tendrils twine up the sides of the building. Everything is suffused with a delicate, green glow. Absent the gro-lights, some of the algae fluoresce in a range of cool-spectrum colors. But primarily greens."
Language,"Eugene is dwarfed by its almost cosmic magnificence. Caption, I can't describe it. None of that language, except for the caption, shows up in the final layout. All of that was me, the writer, giving art direction to Cour, the illustrator. Then they translated that language into their own version. I think it's a pretty faithful translation. My words are translated through Cour's design sensibilities and turned into artwork."
Language,"When you translate a written work into a different medium, whether it's illustrated, animated, recorded, or performed live it changes. It becomes a fundamentally different object. As readers, it's a valuable skill to explore how a text changes as it shifts from one medium to another. And when I say, medium, I mean a style of work, like a stage play, a film, a graphic novel, and audio drama, any of that. Good readers analyze those changes and use them to understand decisions that creators make."
Language,"If you're watching Romeo and Juliet and the director has made the decision to dress everyone in towering robot suits, a detail that is definitely not in the play as written, what does that decision tell you? What does it mean to you? Maybe you have had the experience of reading a book series that was important to you and then they made it into a movie and you were so excited to see the movie, and you sat down to see it and it was awful."
Language,"Like, they cast the wrong actors and they simplified the plot until it made no sense, and it just didn't feel right. That feeling is an example of this tension, this change, between a written material and its visual adaptation. Sometimes it can be bad, sometimes it can be good. Some readers can imagine what characters in books look or sound like, hearing them in their mind's ear, seeing them in their mind's eye."
Language,"The way your imagination renders a character is going to be different from how someone else's imagination does it. So let's compare the script for this audio drama we've got on Khan Academy, Hands Off My Phone, and let's compare that against the recorded version. So first, I'm going to put up the script and I'd like you to pause the video and just read it to yourself very quickly. And now let's take a listen to the recorded version. (upbeat music) (bell ringing) - [Sebastian] Oh no he didn't."
Language,"That is so harsh. - [Valentina] Right? - [Sebastian] Your dad took your phone away, just for getting a D on the history test? - [Valentina] Yep. - [Sebastian] My mind is blown. - [Valentina] Mine too. - [Sebastian] I mean, that was an easy test. - [Valentina] What? - [Sebastian] I can't believe you got a D. - [Valentina] Hey! That's not really-- - [Sebastian] And your dad is the school principal, and he took your phone away. Whoa. (chuckling) - [Valentina] You know, this isn't really helping."
Language,"- [Sebastian] Your life is so bleak right now. -    So you can read that script and think, oh hey, Sebastian is being earnestly sympathetic. Like, he really recognizes that his friend is hurting, but when you hear that performance the way I interpreted this line is that Sebastian is low-key roasting Valentina. He's not saying your life is so bleak in a kind way. He's rubbing salt into the wounds and being a dingus about it."
Language,"There's also other stuff that's not explicitly in the script like, that opening musical sting. (upbeat music) And the ringing of the bell. (bell ringing) Or those background school noises. All of that is meant to represent the fact that you're listening to a fictional show that takes place in a school setting. Does it work? That's for you to decide. When you watch or listen to a performance or a recording, or when you look at illustrations, ask yourself some questions."
Language,"For an audio piece, how do the sound effects, the acting decisions, and the music impact the story or affect the meaning of the words the characters say? How does the way an actor delivers a line change its emphasis? Was someone being sarcastic or sincere in a way you didn't expect, for example? For an illustrated story, how do those illustrations help you understand the author's tone and do you agree with those choices? Is the author's interpretation of the story the same as yours? For a TV show, or a movie, or a play, in addition to all the decisions made by actors about how to use their voices, shape their faces, or hold their bodies, how does the set tell the story? How do costumes tell the story? How does lighting or special effects impact the tone? For TV and film, how does the camera impact the way the story is told? The way a piece of film text is edited, its cuts, its angles, its rhythms, can help shape the way you, as a viewer, as a reader of visual text, understand it."
Language,"And if you can learn that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"At the time of this recording, I'm 31 and I run into new and confusing words every day. I read a lot and it's always a fun challenge to run into words like, I don't know, glabrous or limned or nacreous. I know a lot about language and even I have trouble figuring out what those words mean on their own. So it's important to rely on context, the language that surrounds the word. Let's say you're reading a text and you come across a sentence that has a word in it you don't recognize."
Language,"Here's a bit from a passage about the famous chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. ""Jane Goodall arrived at Tanzania's ""Gombee Stream National Park in 1960. ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers. ""After all, she had not yet been to college."" So let's pause on unconventional. What does that word mean? Well, let me give you some ideas, that's the memory aid I use to keep it straight."
Language,"IDEAS, it stands for inference, definition, example, antonym, synonym, I-D-E-A-S, IDEAS, which are all different kinds of context clues. Every word will have a different context, so you might need to vary your approach. The way this snippet is written let's try inference first, then I'll rewrite the sentence a few times to show you the other methods. Okay, the I in IDEAS, inference. We can draw conclusions from the context."
Language,"If we don't know what unconventional means, we can take a look at the rest of the sentence or other nearby sentences to figure it out. Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal."
Language,"And because I'm making an inference about this word's meaning I wanna keep an eye out for it in other places to see if I can confirm or revise that working definition later. D - definition. Context clues like these will just give you the definition of the word in question. So a good example of that would be: ""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among other animal researchers."
Language,"""She hadn't been to college yet, ""and this made her different and unexpected."" Different and unexpected is a great definition for the word unconventional. This style of context clue occurs when the author expects a word to be unfamiliar to you and builds in a guide for you right there in the text. The E in IDEAS stands for example, and this is somewhere between inference and definition. If the author describes Goodall as unconventional, they'll go on to talk about something unconventional that Goodall did."
Language,"""She was considered somewhat unconventional ""among animal researchers. ""For one thing, she hadn't been to college yet."" So this is very similar to that initial sentence, except for the transition phrase for one thing, which is a way to set up examples. Antonym - an antonym is a word whose meaning is the opposite of another word, like how night is the opposite of day, or how love is the opposite of hate."
Language,"So if there's an example in the text of what Jane Goodall was not, we can use that to figure out what she was. So let's say the passage said: ""Goodall was unconventional. ""She didn't conform, and she wasn't ordinary."" There we have two antonyms and our answer. Similarly, synonym just means write another word with the same meaning similar to a definition. ""Jane Goodall was unconventional. ""She was a nonconformist."
Language,"""She went against the grain."" You can see that I had to rewrite the sentences each time to apply to each context clue strategy, which shows me that you won't find all five context clues every time you need to search for a word's meaning. You need to find the approach that makes the most sense in context. See what I did there, ah huh? And failing that, you can always look up an unfamiliar word in a dictionary. I love to do that."
Language,"I think that's great, but I also feel a sense of victory when I correctly figure out what a new word means, when I've put it together from context. And maybe if I'm still curious, I look it up later and then I turn out to be right, and I'm all like ""Victory at sea, I did it!"" Oh, and if you were curious, glabrous means smooth and hairless like a leaf or the skin of a frog. Nacreous means shiny and rainbow colored like the inside of an oyster shell."
Language,"And to limn something means to draw the outline of or to be highlighted in light. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I'm not gonna say that you need to be able to speak modern Greek or read ancient Latin in order to understand English but many complicated words are made up of little language building blocks that we can break apart, using the power of understanding! (explosion) That was cool right? I'm cool? I'm cool. I'm gonna introduce some vocabulary about vocabulary now, so brace yourselves. There's this idea of a root word. Take the word dent, which is Latin for tooth."
Language,"From that root word, we can get the adjective dental, which means about teeth, or the noun dentist, which means a person who specializes in teeth, or the noun dentures, which are false teeth. That's what a root is. Now you can also combine roots to make words. The word phot is Greek for light, the root graph comes from the Greek for writing. You put those together, you get photograph or writing with light. It's kind of poetic, isn't it? To this understanding, let us add the idea of an affix."
Language,"Affixes aren't words or roots but they are word particles that convey meaning. Maybe you've heard of prefixes and suffixes, if you have, these are both types of affixes. Prefixes attach at the front end of a word, whereas suffixes attach at the back end. An example of a suffix would be logy, meaning the study of or the science of."
Language,"So we can make a bunch of words with logy, like biology, that's supposed to be a little amoeba; cetology, the study or science of whales; anthropology, the study of human beings; cosmology, the study of the universe. So if you see a logy, it's going to be some kind of science or specialized area of study. A good example of a prefix would be the Greek para, which means alongside."
Language,"So a paralegal is someone who works alongside lawyers, a paramedic works alongside doctors and if your house is haunted, you don't need a normal pest control expert to get rid of the ghost, you need a paranormal pest control expert, one that is alongside but not within normalcy and thus, you call the Ghostbusters. So what does all of this mean for you as a reader? Well when I encounter a word I don't understand, it's like I had been walking down a hallway and was suddenly confronted with a locked door."
Language,"It's frustrating but the magic, the power of studying roots, prefixes and suffixes is that when you master a small handful of them, you suddenly become the proud owner of a ring of keys. Doors fling themselves open for you, you can go anywhere, you can understand any concept, any piece of vocabulary. An army of locked doors fall off their hinges all at once when you approach. Don't believe me? I'll show you. While excavating the foundation for a geothermal plant, my companion Neha found a fossil."
Language,"Upon closer inspection, she realized it was a pterodactyl. Wow, lot of big words in that little paragraph. Now, watch this. Excavating, so hollowing out. Foundation, bottom-making. Geothermal, Earth heat. Companion, so this is someone you would eat bread with, so bread together, who do we eat bread together with? Our friends. Inspection, looking in or closer and pterodactyl, pter means wing, dactyl means finger, it is a prehistoric winged reptile."
Language,"So while she was digging in the ground to prepare the bottom of a plant that gets electricity from the heat of the Earth, my friend Neha found a fossil. When she looked at it closely, she realized it was a flying reptile with fingery wings. Do you see what I mean about keys? Studying roots and affixes gives me the power to look at those words and crack them apart. You're not so big now, vocabulary word. You have no power over me! Studying roots, prefixes and suffixes will give you that same power."
Language,"I promise you it is awesome, like, literally it fills me with a sense of awe. The power is yours for the taking. You can learn anything, David out. Okay are we doing those fun history reasons though? Okay, the short version is that first the Romans then some Vikings, then some French Vikings invaded the island of Great Britain a bunch of times over the last 1500 years, shaping the language and making what I like to call French-shaped dents in the Germanic structure of English."
Language,"English is a Germanic language, French is a Romance language, meaning not that it is full of love but that it is an offshoot of Latin or you know, Roman. French took root in 11th Century English and merged with it, grafting an enormous amount of Greek and Latin vocabulary on to a German root stock. We often reach for Latin and Greek compounds when we compose new words, which is why we say television in English, which comes from the Greek tele, meaning far away, and the Latin vire, meaning to see."
Language,"If we reached for Germanic roots to make new words, we'd call a television a farseer because indeed, that's what the word is in German, fernsehen. So why do we have Greek and Latin in our vocabulary? Because England was colonized by French speakers almost a thousand years ago. Imagine what English will sound like in another thousand years. Anyway, thanks for coming on this tangent with me. David out for real this time, bye.."
Language,"Tone communicates how an author feels about the topic they're writing about, this can come across in a number of different ways, it can reflect their enthusiasm or skepticism, it can also communicate formality or informality, an academic paper or a speech before the UN, for example are very different things from a toast at a wedding or a thank you card for a birthday gift and this kind of difference in tone is something that sociologists and linguists call register."
Language,"Social conventions and customs call for different registers in different circumstances, just as it would be inappropriate in most situations to wear a tuxedo at the beach, so too would it be incongruous to use extremely formal language in an informal setting? (melodic orchestral music) (clearing throat) Dear honored sir, it was the privilege of my very life to have you attend my 14th birthday party. I am grateful beyond words for your most generous gift, a check for $36 American."
Language,"Your humble and obedient servant, David. In fact using extremely formal language and high-minded gratitude for something as relatively small as a birthday gift might even come across as sarcastic or insulting. But this is sort of an extreme example, let's pull back and discuss how an understanding of tone can aid you in making sense of informational texts."
Language,"One great way to do that is to analyze word choice, we can look at a writer's language and determine their attitude towards the subject based on the words they've chosen to describe it. Oceans of ink have been spilled over comparisons between a Chicago style hotdog and a New York style hotdog. The first with its garden's worth of toppings, but a holier than now prohibition of ketchup, the latter with its sauerkraut, mustard and dubious dirty water cooking style."
Language,"But scant attention, a droplet of ink before the ocean has been paid to the half-smoke, the unsung but mighty regional sausage of Washington DC. Now how does the author think about the subject? Well, we know that they think that not enough writing has been done about DC's regional sausage, the half-smoke, but how do they feel about it? How do the words they use express their feelings? Let's break it down bit by bit."
Language,"So right out of the gate, we have oceans of ink, this is a deliberate piece of overstatement, there are no literal oceans made of ink, but it's being set up in opposition to the droplet of ink used to describe half-smokes later in the paragraph."
Language,"Half-smokes are described as unsung, but mighty, which suggests that they haven't been given their due, there hasn't been enough praise for half-smokes and that therefore the amount of attention given to Chicago and New York hotdogs is unfair or even disproportionate. I think we can also determine from word choice, that the author thinks a Chicago hot dog is a little ridiculous and that a New York hot dog is a little gross."
Language,"How do we know this? Chicagoans generally don't like ketchup on their hotdogs and the way the author phrases this is by saying, that they have a holier than thou prohibition on ketchup, which is to say they get all haughty and upset about it, which is weird because it's ketchup, listen, I'm a Chicagoan by birth, I used to feel this way and I'm not even sure why."
Language,"Similarly the word dubious in the description of the New York hotdog, meaning doubtful suggests that the dirty water cooking method is kind of nasty sounding, why would the author do this? Is it to say these are terrible hot dogs and nobody should eat them? No, I don't think so, The author is trying to make room for the half-smoke in the national sausage conversation and to do that, they're first trying to dismantle the importance of New York and Chicago style by making fun of them."
Language,"These are tactical choices, not to be confused with authorial voice, which is a different concept entirely an author's voice is their style, it's much more consistent across topics, whereas a tone is specific to a topic. So I might have an authorial voice, that uses a lot of goofy wordplay, but I use a sympathetic tone to talk about bears and a hostile tone to talk about, I don't know, whales, yeah, boo whales, I said it. I do not actually hate whales, I love whales."
Language,"But my point is this, use your knowledge of words, of the connotation and implications of the language, that an author might use to unlock your understanding of their tone, because if you can do that, my friend, you can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"(tense big band music) Friday was a very straightforward, almost relentless, character and the catchphrase associated with his character was ""Just the facts."" ""All we want are the facts, ma'am,"" was the sort of thing that he would say. And that's what we're talking about today: just the facts. There's this idea called objectivity. That you can talk about something without inserting any opinions which are personal thoughts or beliefs."
Language,"Doing this, being objective, is very difficult; opinions want to creep in. So what does it mean for a summary to be objective? It means it isn't influenced by feelings or opinions, it's not written in the first person, it's about the text, not me, and it's not a judgment or a review of the information. Let's be clear here; it's not bad to have opinions. In my opinion, it is good to have opinions, but they do not have a place in summaries. You can put opinions to use when you analyze or evaluate something."
Language,"When you're looking at summaries and you're trying to determine whether one is objective or not, look for words that cast judgment. Does the writer say something is good or terrible or useful or useless? Let's do this together. I'll take this text and summarize it without any opinions. Polar bears hunt for seals on thick sea ice in the Arctic. As the Earth grows warmer, though, sea ice gets thinner."
Language,"With less stable ground, some hungry polar bears search for food inland, often dangerously close to human environments. Although polar bears usually keep to themselves, a very scared or angry one could attack, and even eat, a human. Several villages have set up polar bear patrols as a result. The patrollers zoom around on snowmobiles, using bright lights and loud noises to scare away polar bears. Hopefully, the polar bears find another snack later on."
Language,"Here's my summary: Climate change causes polar bears to encroach on human habitats to search for food. As a consequence, these villages have set up polar bear patrols to frighten them away. As a person who cares about climate change, as well as the wellbeing of bears and human beings, I have all sorts of opinions about this, but for the purposes of summarizing that paragraph, I have to put them aside. Just the facts, ma'am."
Language,"(Dragnet theme) If you get good enough at making objective summaries, you'll start noticing when opinion creeps into things you expect to be objective. And it won't be obvious like bears are terrible and humans are right to scare them away or climate change ravages bear habitats, sending defenseless bears into the jaws of doom: human villages. But it might be in the way a story is framed. Like, there's a difference between bears move into human habitats and bears are forced into human habitats."
Language,"What causes them to move? Forced by whom or by what? Sometimes what's not in a text can be as important as what's in it. Experiment with this a little. Try summarizing some news articles and see if you can restate the facts of the stories without inserting any opinions. It's a fun challenge and it may expose an opinion where you didn't expect to see it. Objectively, you can learn anything. David out. Constant vigilance!."
Language,"Once we've sussed out whose perspective a story or a poem is being told from, what's next? What else is there to talk about? Well, I think it's useful to remember that stories and poems don't just happen. They don't just suddenly, spontaneously exist. Creating them is work. And it's the result of a whole bunch of decisions made by a writer. So, who is the point-of-view character or characters? What does that mean for the story? Ultimately, a point of view is an author's decision."
Language,"So, when an author chooses to center a story on one character, how does that change the story they tell? Would the story be different if it were centered on a different character? How does that point of view impact the way the story gets told? Imagine a rocket scientist with a mouse in her pocket, and they're going to inspect a spaceship under construction."
Language,"I'm gonna give you two little snippets in what's called close third person perspective, where there's a narrator, but their point of view is attached to a character. We get to see through their eyes, experience their thoughts. So, first, we're gonna hear from the rocket scientist. ""Leaving the lab, Dr. Harper strode confidently ""into the spaceship hangar, ""clipboard in hand, pet mouse in pocket."
Language,"""Launch day was only eight months away, ""and Project Juno still had so many bugs to work out, ""but she was certain that the test she'd conduct today ""would help her solve the air filter problem. ""The starship sat before her in a pool of light, ""a deep bluish-black craft, ""once an idea that had lived only in her mind, ""but now it was a real physical object. ""She dug around in her pocket ""and fed Persephone a sunflower seed."" Now, let's take that again from the mouse's perspective. ""Persephone T."
Language,"Mouse ""clung to the lip of Tatiana's jacket pocket, ""as they passed from a small cold room ""into a much larger, warmer, and brighter room. ""It had been four hours since she'd had anything to eat, ""and she was cranky. ""In the middle of the big, bright room ""was a big bluish black shape. ""Persophone didn't know what it was, ""and frankly, it looked kind of like a bird, ""which was weird and a little frightening."
Language,"""But it hadn't moved ""the last time Persephone and Tatiana were in there, ""and it wasn't moving now. ""So, Persephone guessed it was asleep. ""She chirped impatiently, ""and Tatiana gave her a sunflower seed."" You see, the same things happen in each story. Dr. Harper goes from her lab to the spaceship hangar, and then, she feeds her pet mouse a sunflower seed. But when we hang out with Harper's perspective, we get her thoughts and we see what she thinks is important."
Language,"But when we're reading from Persephone the mouse's perspective, she doesn't care about the spaceship, she doesn't know what it is. As readers, it's useful to ask how a writer is developing a character's point of view through a story. What are the abilities and limitations of a point-of-view character? Persephone the mouse is small. She can sneak through little holes in the wall or hide in the jacket pocket of a consenting human being. But Dr."
Language,"Harper has, you know, an astrophysics doctorate and opposable thumbs. She can open doors, design a spaceship, plan its flight trajectory. This is kind of an extreme example because one of these characters is a human being and the other one is a mouse. But even among different people, we can imagine very different stories. Characters and stories are just like real people. They have strengths and weaknesses, knowledge about some things and ignorance about others."
Language,"Sometimes, they tell the truth, and sometimes, they lie. This is especially important in first-person books, where everything we read comes to us directly from the point-of-view character. You have to open yourself up to the possibility that the narrator can be wrong about stuff. They can perceive things incorrectly, or be blinded by their own assumptions, or just be confused. They could also just be lying. But they could also just be innocently wrong and confused."
Language,They could look at a spaceship and think it's a bird. Narrators that are wrong or misinformed or actively trying to trick you are called unreliable narrators. Reading a book narrated by an unreliable narrator turns the relatively straightforward process of reading into a tug of war.
Language,"How do I know I can trust what the narrator is telling me? Ask yourself, what does a narrator think? What do they feel and what do they do? When you can answer all of those questions, you can begin to put their perspective into words. If you can identify the biases or the perspective or the ignorance of a point-of-view character, you can start to correct for it as you read, and use that understanding of the point of view to better understand the story as a whole."
Language,"Something important to remember is that the storytelling character is not the same thing as the author. The author creates those characters and is literally the person who writes the words. But if I wrote a story about an ogre who eats children, that does not make me an ogre who eats children. I would never eat children. They taste horrible. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"It doesn't contain violence, obscenity or profanity. Or even anything that wouldn't appear in a G-rated movie, but it will contain explicit evidence. Yes, we're talking about citing evidence in literary analysis. When you're talking about a text and making arguments about it, in order to successfully build that argument, you must make inferences and draw conclusions. And those must be built on the back of evidence."
Language,"Both explicit, that is stated in the text, or implicit or based on clues or evidence in the text. So your responsibility is to tie those conclusions or inferences back to explicit or implicit evidence in the text. It can't just be, ""This is a feeling I have."" It has to be, ""My feeling about this is backed up by this specific evidence."" Say you're trying to be make an argument in a book that the captain of this pirate ship, let's just say, I guess, he's a birdman. That's what I drew, he's a birdman."
Language,"He's really unkind to the main character in the beginning of the book, but changes by the end of the book and treats everyone, including the main character with respect and courtesy. So I'm gonna write that my argument is that the captain's behavior changes towards the MC, the main character. I have to back that assertion up with evidence. So how do we find those details? First, you have to seek out parts of the book where the captain and the main character interact."
Language,"Then look closely at the pros and dialogue. What are the details that prove your point? Which are the strongest, most specific details that say, ""Oh, yes, here is where the captain is being mean. Here is where the captain is being respectful."" If you can't find evidence for your assertion, first, try searching in a different part of the book. Or importantly, acknowledge the possibility that you might have a weak argument."
Language,"Maybe it's time to start over and find a new or different argument to make and find support for. Once you've assembled your evidence work it into your analysis. ""Captain Bigsby is dismissive and rude to Eniola when she first joins the crew of the pirate ship Albatross,"" I might say. And then back it up with an explicit example of Captain Bigsby being dismissive and rude with a page number citation like so."
Language,"On page 34 of ""To the Burbling Deep,"" Bigsby says to Eniola, ""You there, what's her name! These portholes need to be scrubbed yesterday. Get to work!."" ""Yes, sir, Captain,"" Eniola said. ""But my name is-"" ""Does it look like I care?"" the captain snarled. But by the end of the story, when Eniola has proven her worth, saved the day, and humbled the captain, he treats her, and everyone around him, with much greater respect and deference."
Language,"On page 225, after Bigsby tends to Eniola's broken leg, he tells her, ""Eniola, that was some mighty fine pirating you did. You showed no fear when you punched that kraken, and more importantly, you showed no fear when you stood up to me. I was wrong, and I have been a jerk, and I am sorry."" Now both of those examples use explicit evidence where Captain Bigsby is being a jerk and then when he is apologizing for being a jerk. There's also implicit evidence too. Bigsby tends to Eniola's broken leg."
Language,"So while he's not saying, ""I will take care of you little buddy,"" with his words, he is saying it with his actions. And in that first example when he demands that Eniola clean the portholes, he's not literally saying, ""I'm impatient,"" But by saying, ""They need to be scrubbed yesterday,"" as an immediately because you already messed up, he's implying that he's impatient. Now there is no such book that I know of about a kraken punching girl pirate. But if we're lucky, my friend Jordan will write one."
Language,"Remember to use strong details to get good evidence. There might be a part of ""To The Burbling Deep"" where Captain Bigsby huffs angrily at Eniola but doesn't say anything, and that's mean or, at least, impolite, but it's not as strong as him yelling at her. So when you find the detail, ask yourself, how does that detail related back to your analysis or your argument."
Language,"Is it repeated? Does that detail or detail similar to it appear elsewhere in the text? And if you see a lot of similar details, how do those details prove the argument that you're trying to make? If you have a sense of what the central idea or ideas of the text is, try to connect those details back to that central idea and then connect that central idea to your own argument. I don't know what ""To the Burbling Deep"" is about 'cause I made it up 20 minutes ago."
Language,"But maybe one theme in it is that it's important to recognize the potential with another people. And that can be both true for Eniola who becomes a hero and punches a giant octopus monster, but it can also be true of Captain Bigsby who occupies kind of antagonistic role and then changes through the story. And so we can build our argument around that idea that character change is possible. Not just for the main character, but for everybody. So that's where I will leave you."
Language,"Remember to choose the pieces of evidence that give you the strongest support for your idea and if the evidence doesn't match your idea, you might need to change the idea itself. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Understanding the plot of a story is essential to writing about it. You can't write about a story if you can't express what happened in it. So what I want to do today is talk about creating objective summaries of texts. Summaries that are free of opinion, or non biased. If you're summarizing a book, you wanna get across the events of the story. Objectivity is hard and weird and has a very specific purpose. You use it to build the bones of your analysis."
Language,"Once you've got the structure in place, bring opinions back. Here are the facts and now here's what I think about those facts. Let me be clear, opinions are good. Opinions are where analysis lives. The whole field of literary criticism would be awfully boring if nobody ever held opinions but all that criticism rests on a basis of objectively summarized texts. So let's talk about how to do just that, how to objectively summarize a text. Here's what you need to do."
Language,"Step one, read the thing you want to summarize. You can't do one without the other. Step two, ask yourself, what are the important parts of this story? Not the interesting parts, not the cool parts, but the most essential parts of the story. Remember we're trying to be objective here so it's not about including the parts you especially liked. So who are the main characters, where does the story take place, what happens in the plot? Step three, pare it down."
Language,"Look at all those important parts you listed, and cut out everything that isn't absolutely essential. Major characters only, setting, conflict, climax, resolution. Step four, put it in order. Write it all out as sentences in the order the plot happened in. The idea is to be able to summarize a whole story in a handful of sentences, like a single five sentence paragraph. And you're gonna wanna paraphrase here."
Language,"Whatever you need to say, say it in your own words so you can get it across as quickly as possible. Ordinarily, I'd say quoting from the text is an important skill but this is one time you won't use it. All right so, those are the four steps. To demonstrate, I'm gonna take a fiction piece from a Khan Academy exercise and I'll go through that process with you. Step one, let's read it all, read this little story chunk. ""'Wilky!' Captain Martello bellowed below deck."
Language,"""'We need your help!' I climbed the ladder quickly ""and was astonished that I hadn't awakened on my own. ""Usually I could sense a storm brewing ""hours before it arrived. ""Captain Martello noticed my look of surprise. ""'She's coming on quick, this one. Here, grab the rope, ""Help me pull down the sail.' ""Overboard, the waters had changed. ""No longer were they an inviting green hue, ""they were dark, foreboding."
Language,"""The moon above tried to peek through the angry sky ""but the clouds kept hijacking her hopeful glow. ""Suddenly, a giant slow rolling wave ""forced my side of the vessel to dip into the water. ""I tried to hang on but the lurching wave was tugging at me. ""Captain Martello grabbed my leg ""and managed to yank me onto Adelina's salt sprayed deck. ""'You're safe,' he said firmly, 'for now.'"" Okay step two, what are the important parts of the story? Okay so Wilky comes on deck when Captain Martello asks him to."
Language,"They're on a boat. And note here that I'm just sort of scribbling down notes, these aren't even sentences. There's a storm coming that Wilky didn't predict. The captain tells Wilky to help him strike the sail. The water is a scary color, a wave nearly washes Wilky overboard but the captain saves him. Oh and the ship is called the Adelina. I think that's a neat name for a ship. All right step three, pare it down. So the fact that I think that Adelina is a neat name for a ship is opinion and not relevant."
Language,"It's also not super relevant that Wilky didn't predict the storm. Or that the water is a spooky color. So do we have all the important details in here? The name of the ship, check. The name of Wilky and Captain Martello, the fact that there is a storm. So part of this is relevant but not the prediction part and Wilky nearly being tossed overboard but saved by the captain. So step four, let's take all of that, put it in order. Start afresh, full sentences, okay."
Language,"Captain Martello calls Wilky up to the deck of the Adelina to help him prepare the ship for a sudden storm. Wilky is nearly washed overboard by a big wave but Martello saves them. That's our strategy, you see? Boil down the story to its essentials, strip away unnecessary detail and rephrase events in your own words in the order that they happened in. Once you've got that squared away, you're ready to back up that great big dump truck full of opinions. All right bring her in."
Language,"(truck backing up beeping) Let them have it, fellows. (crashing) You love to see it. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Drama, also known as theater or plays, is a specialized kind of story that is meant to be performed. If you've ever seen a movie, a television show or a play, or if you've ever heard a play on the radio or through a podcast, you've experienced the magic of the dramatic arts. Writing a drama is different than writing a poem or story. And that means that reading one is different, too. So I'm gonna show you part of a short drama on the Khan Academy website in order to go through the parts of a play."
Language,"Okay, so here we have the title of the piece, My Unusual Aunt. But it's followed by something you maybe haven't seen before which is the Cast of Characters. This tells us who's in the play, a 12 year old named Isabella, and her aunt Yasmin. Now these are the characters the actors will be performing in the drama. There may be other people referenced. Like for example in this piece Isabella refers to her Dad being asleep in Scene Two. But he never shows up on stage."
Language,"A play is decided into scenes, which you can think of like chapters in a book. Scenes are sections of a drama that are separated by time or location. Scene One takes place in the evening outside. Scene Two takes place at Isabella's house some time later. How do we know that? The setting and stage directions. So this italic slanty text here in the brackets tells us where the scene is set in time and space. It says Evening: Isabella is walking her dog Stanley. A bat dives down."
Language,"The name Isabella is in all capital letters to make sure the actor playing Isabella notices. And from this we know several things. Isabella is in this scene, she's outside, she's walking her dog, and it's nighttime. So if this were a stage play, we'd maybe see a set that looks like Isabella's neighborhood. She's walking the dogs, maybe we'd see a little bit of sidewalk or a fire hydrant. There's more italics in this bit, and it what are called stage directions."
Language,"An actor wouldn't read this aloud during a performance. Instead, stage directions tell the team putting a drama together what is happening on stage. So a bat dives down. That's gonna be a puppet or a prop operated by a puppeteer or a stage hand. And then we have this line of dialogue spoken by Isabella reacting to the bat. Ugh, since when do we have bats in the neighborhood? C'mon Stanley, let's run home. So characters have lines. The character name indicates which character is speaking."
Language,"Sometimes you'll have a stage direction just before a line of dialogue, as we can see in Scene Two. And Yasmin points to a giant trunk before she talks, but the actor playing her wouldn't say pointing at giant trunk aloud. That's a physical action the script is asking her to perform. These are the basic components of a stage play."
Language,"The characters and their descriptions, the way the play is divided into scenes, the stage directions that tell actors and others what to do, and the lines of dialogue that actors have to deliver aloud. These are the building blocks of a play. And now that you know that, you know just enough to be dangerous. Go write a play! Tell it I sent you. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Who knows what, when, and what does that tell us? A writer can control which characters have access to information, and they can control what access you, the reader, or the viewer, have to information to. The information you have and the information the characters have help develop our perspectives. Within a story, conflict between characters can come from a difference in perspective."
Language,"In ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" the character of Prince Zuko is consumed by his desire to capture the avatar, as he feels that this will end his exile and restore him to a place of prominence at his father's side. His uncle Iroh, however, understands based on many years of hard experience, that Zuko's father is a cruel man who never intended to take his son back. Iroh only wants to keep his nephew safe. This difference in perspective generates a lot of conflict between the two of them."
Language,"The show slowly reveals Iroh's perspective over time. Whereas we, as viewers, know what Zuko wants and why almost immediately. In fiction, that kind of information asymmetry between the storyteller, the characters, and the audience, leads to something called dramatic irony. You're watching a play, or a TV show, or reading a book, and you, the audience, the reader, knows something that the characters don't."
Language,"This is possible because especially in a visual medium, the audience has a different point of view than the characters do. We can see things they don't see. This difference in point of view is what allows tension, suspense, and jokes. Remember, irony is just the difference between expectation and result. It can be leveraged to achieve anything that uses the mechanism of surprise. I don't wanna belabor how jokes work. Literally nothing is more boring or unfunny than explaining jokes."
Language,"So, let's use suspense as our example. Imagine a very low stakes villain, The Cheeseler, who goes around pranking people by balancing buckets of cottage cheese on doorframes. You go through the door, blam, you get cheesed. I want you to imagine a scene in which we see The Cheeseler booby trap the protagonist's door with a bucket of cottage cheese. Nobody else in the story is around to witness this. After all, The Cheeseler stands alone. And now, we see our hero in Tamika."
Language,"She's walking down the hall with such confidence, blindly unaware of the cheesy threat that awaits her when she opens that door. We come back to the cheese. It's still there, oh no, oh no Tamika. Do you see what I'm doing here? Do you see how this generates suspense? You, the viewer, know something the character doesn't know. The difference between her point of view and your point of view generates tension. This is something that writers do on purpose."
Language,"This tension, this dramatic irony, draws us in because it's very satisfying to see it resolved. We know that there's that possibility of Tamika getting splatted with cottage cheese, but what if Tamika, at the last moment, kicks open the door? The cheese bucket drops, and Tamika catches it neatly. Whoo, thank goodness. She saw that the door was slightly ajar and put it together. The tension is resolved as the gap closes between what Tamika knows and what we know."
Language,"When characters resolve interpersonal differences, it's through an alignment of their points of view. That's what brings us to resolution. The difference between two points of view can be reconciled, and that too, is a way of relieving story tension. Now, I'd like to counsel you against making blanket statements about specific genres of work, like sure, a first person story could limit the flow of information because we're perceiving a story through the senses of the point of view character."
Language,"But, in your analysis of that story, be sure to get specific. How does that specific character in that particular situation see events? Why does the author show us, the readers, information that character doesn't get to see? Asking yourself questions about those differences in perspective between the narration and characters, between two or more characters, between the text and the reader, will make it easy for you to analyze the impact of those decisions that the author made."
Language,"And now, I'm going to go walk my dog. I will see you all next time. You can learn anything, David out. All right. (humming) (metal clanking) Oh, curse you Cheeseler!."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"Tone communicates how an author feels about the topic they're writing about, this can come across in a number of different ways, it can reflect their enthusiasm or skepticism, it can also communicate formality or informality, an academic paper or a speech before the UN, for example are very different things from a toast at a wedding or a thank you card for a birthday gift and this kind of difference in tone is something that sociologists and linguists call register."
Language,"Social conventions and customs call for different registers in different circumstances, just as it would be inappropriate in most situations to wear a tuxedo at the beach, so too would it be incongruous to use extremely formal language in an informal setting? (melodic orchestral music) (clearing throat) Dear honored sir, it was the privilege of my very life to have you attend my 14th birthday party. I am grateful beyond words for your most generous gift, a check for $36 American."
Language,"Your humble and obedient servant, David. In fact using extremely formal language and high-minded gratitude for something as relatively small as a birthday gift might even come across as sarcastic or insulting. But this is sort of an extreme example, let's pull back and discuss how an understanding of tone can aid you in making sense of informational texts."
Language,"One great way to do that is to analyze word choice, we can look at a writer's language and determine their attitude towards the subject based on the words they've chosen to describe it. Oceans of ink have been spilled over comparisons between a Chicago style hotdog and a New York style hotdog. The first with its garden's worth of toppings, but a holier than now prohibition of ketchup, the latter with its sauerkraut, mustard and dubious dirty water cooking style."
Language,"But scant attention, a droplet of ink before the ocean has been paid to the half-smoke, the unsung but mighty regional sausage of Washington DC. Now how does the author think about the subject? Well, we know that they think that not enough writing has been done about DC's regional sausage, the half-smoke, but how do they feel about it? How do the words they use express their feelings? Let's break it down bit by bit."
Language,"So right out of the gate, we have oceans of ink, this is a deliberate piece of overstatement, there are no literal oceans made of ink, but it's being set up in opposition to the droplet of ink used to describe half-smokes later in the paragraph."
Language,"Half-smokes are described as unsung, but mighty, which suggests that they haven't been given their due, there hasn't been enough praise for half-smokes and that therefore the amount of attention given to Chicago and New York hotdogs is unfair or even disproportionate. I think we can also determine from word choice, that the author thinks a Chicago hot dog is a little ridiculous and that a New York hot dog is a little gross."
Language,"How do we know this? Chicagoans generally don't like ketchup on their hotdogs and the way the author phrases this is by saying, that they have a holier than thou prohibition on ketchup, which is to say they get all haughty and upset about it, which is weird because it's ketchup, listen, I'm a Chicagoan by birth, I used to feel this way and I'm not even sure why."
Language,"Similarly the word dubious in the description of the New York hotdog, meaning doubtful suggests that the dirty water cooking method is kind of nasty sounding, why would the author do this? Is it to say these are terrible hot dogs and nobody should eat them? No, I don't think so, The author is trying to make room for the half-smoke in the national sausage conversation and to do that, they're first trying to dismantle the importance of New York and Chicago style by making fun of them."
Language,"These are tactical choices, not to be confused with authorial voice, which is a different concept entirely an author's voice is their style, it's much more consistent across topics, whereas a tone is specific to a topic. So I might have an authorial voice, that uses a lot of goofy wordplay, but I use a sympathetic tone to talk about bears and a hostile tone to talk about, I don't know, whales, yeah, boo whales, I said it. I do not actually hate whales, I love whales."
Language,"But my point is this, use your knowledge of words, of the connotation and implications of the language, that an author might use to unlock your understanding of their tone, because if you can do that, my friend, you can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"""This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why."" Argument does not sneak, it does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories: data, fact, observable reality. There is a place for pure subjective opinion, and it is the realm of the movie and the restaurant review."
Language,"""I did not like this movie because I didn't laugh at its jokes."" ""I did not enjoy the hamburger I got because I found it too dry for my liking."" This is not what we're talking about today. Obviously, argument is rooted in opinion and subjective personal preferences, but those opinions need to be backed up with evidence. Let's compare arguments for and against a tax on soda."
Language,"Now, this writer argues that sugar contributes to obesity, and therefore, people should be prevented from buying soda, which is full of sugar on the grounds that it is bad for them, let's take a look. The soda tax could alter many people's behavior, causing them to stop buying sugary drinks. Some foods are necessities like milk, eggs, and bread. People will buy them even if the prices increase. Sugary drinks aren't necessary."
Language,"If the price goes up, people will buy fewer sugary drinks and they won't be consuming as much sugar, therefore, the obesity rate will go down. Whereas this author counters that people have a right to make what they see as unhealthy decisions. Soda and other sugary drinks have been targeted because they lack nutrition and are basically just liquid sugar. Most people would agree that proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
Language,"However, do legislators have the right or responsibility to regulate people's sugar intake in order to improve their health? I say, no. All right, let's evaluate these claims. For the first argument in favor of the soda tax, how do we know this is true? What evidence does this author give that this tax will alter people's behavior? What evidence does this author give that sugary drinks aren't seen to be as essential as milk? After all, not everyone can or does drink milk."
Language,"In the piece, the evidence that the author gives us is this table, which shows how much sugar is in soda per serving, but it doesn't use evidence to connect sugar consumption to unhealthy outcomes. All this says is, soda has a lot of sugar. I wanna see evidence, I wanna see studies. How do we know this tax would change behavior? Good readers think through the impacts of an argument."
Language,"If this tax went into effect, what would the consequences be? Are there faults in the author's logic? It might stop some people from buying soda, but in an unfair way. Here's how I'm processing this as a reader. If you take a bottle of soda that previously costs, say $2, and the tax makes it $10, that will make it more difficult to purchase. But to a millionaire, the difference between $2 and $10 is basically nothing. Whereas to a poor or middle class person, that $8 difference adds up pretty quickly."
Language,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary."
Language,"So now I'm asking, whose responsibility is it to determine how much sugar is in a drink? Why is sugar so inexpensive to begin with? Do legislators have a responsibility there? Now we know it's not legal to bottle rat poison and sell it as tea, but whose responsibility is that? What isn't this author saying, and how does not saying it serve their argument? They're not saying what the government could or should do, only what it shouldn't do."
Language,"And this is why I want you to be skeptical whenever you read anyone's argument about anything. You need to figure out what the terms of the debate are. What does the argument assume as a given? What's a problem worth fixing? What are the trade offs that the writer thinks are acceptable? So when you encounter an argument in text, look for the claims, and then look to see if those claims are backed up with data-supported reasoning."
Language,"Is the author using evidence and logic? Do they anticipate objections to their arguments and push back on or incorporate those critiques? Above all else, I want you to remain skeptical. Everyone's selling something, even me. It's just the thing I'm trying to sell you is the fundamental idea that you can learn anything. You've got this, Readers. David out.."
Language,"I don't literally mean that I've got a bear. That would be extremely sweet. Love a bear, love bear's whole thing with the snacking and the sleeping and the eating of fish, but no. A bear of is a figurative expression that means something difficult. So a bear of a lesson is a difficult lesson and that's what we're talking about today. Not bears, sorry, but non-literal uses of language, which we call figurative language or figures of speech. Figurative language says one thing but means another."
Language,"I could say that my colleague Allison is an eagle-eyed editor and when I say that I don't mean that she literally has an eagle's eyes in her head. That would be a terrifying achievement of medical science. No, I'm saying that she is sharp and attentive in the same way that an eagle is. So I'm saying something that is not literally true in order to express something that is true, that Allison is good at editing. Would you call that a lie? I'm not sure I would."
Language,"It's just a non-literal way of expressing myself. So, having gotten the question of whether or not I'm a dirty rotten liar out of the way, let's talk about some different varieties of figurative language. First, the simile. A simile is a comparison between two things that uses like or as. If I were really hungry, I could say that my stomach was gurgling like a tar pit or that I was as hungry as a ravenous wolf, and again, neither of these things are literally true."
Language,"If my stomach were making actual tar pit noises, I would probably need to go to a hospital. But what do those examples tell you about the way that I, the speaker, think about my hunger? Animals and people get stuck in tar pits, they're gloppy, they pull things into them, they slow things down. Sorry T-Rex. Therefore, I'm saying that my hunger is slowing me down. Or, if I'm comparing myself to a wolf, you can imagine me looking lean and desperate, saliva dripping from my jaws at the mere thought of food."
Language,"I could really go for a cheese danish come to think of it. So that's simile. The second figure of speech I wanna talk about today is the metaphor. And what's a metaphor? Cows and sheep! Sorry, I couldn't help it. No, a metaphor is not a meadow for. Metaphors are another way of comparing two things, but this time there's no like or as. We're walking this language tightrope without a net now."
Language,"You aren't signaling with like or as that you're making a figurative comparison, so you have to use context to communicate clearly. At the beginning of this video I said this was going to be a bear of a lesson. That's a metaphor. There's a Linda Ronstadt country song from the 70s, called ""Love is a Rose,"" which is all about how to take care of a relationship through the metaphor of tending a flower with thorns on it."
Language,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person."
Language,"To say that differently, it's ascribing human characteristics to non-living things. The wind howled through the mountains. The car grumbled as I threw it into gear. The storm raged. These are things that people do, but I'm applying that language to inanimate things, like wind and cars and storms in order to express the way these things are behaving. The car is not literally grumbling, ""Aw man, I can't believe David has to drive me today."" It's making noises that I am choosing to identify as unhappy."
Language,"The greatest kind of figurative language in the entire universe is hyperbole. By exaggerating, I'm expressing emphasis and importance. This summer, I'm going to read a million books and eat a literal actual ton of hot dogs. This is not true. In fact, this is impossible. That is too many hot dogs, those are too many books, each of which are sentences I never expected to say, but I'm trying to express my enthusiasm for both books and encased meats, and I'm doing that by being, you know, extra."
Language,"The final kind of expressive language I wanna talk about today isn't exactly figurative language, it's the language of allusions and references. Where you make comparisons to characters or events from literature, or movies, or culture. Also note that it's allusion with an A, as opposed to illusion with an I. An illusion with an I is like a magic trick. Here are some examples of allusions. Oh, you'd have to be Superman to lift that fallen tree. Or, you have a Gollum-like obsession with that stuffed animal."
Language,"Now these comparisons only work if the person you're talking to understands the reference. Superman has super strength, Gollum, from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" can't stop talking about how much he loves this one object, the ring. If you don't know the reference, then it's all just noise. One tip is to read up on mythology. You'd be surprised how many times ancient gods, like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo come up as you read. So that's what we're working with here. Simile, love is like a rose."
Language,"Metaphor, love is a rose. Personification, my car grumbled. Hyperbole, my mom grounded me for eight trillion years. And allusion, I feel mightier than Hercules. That's figurative language folks. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word. This is distinct from denotation, which is more like the dictionary definition of a word. Companion and buddy both have similar denotations. They both mean friend, but companion is a much more formal sounding word than buddy. Which originated as a piece of slang from the 19th century."
Language,"So even though their denotation or their literal definition is the same, they feel different. The connotation of companion is formal while the connotation of buddy is friendly and casual. Good readers pay close attention to the words the author chose to use. They picked those words for a reason. How do those words make you feel? What is the author trying to imply? How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"How do we know that though? How did J. R. R. Tolkien, as an author, develop that theme in the text? How can we go deeper, beyond that headline of the Ring equals the dangers of absolute power? Good readers can look at a whole text from beginning to end and identify where the author purposefully chose words, included details, or directed action that develops or reveals the overall theme."
Language,"It's not just that characters say, ""Oh, no, the Ring's super-dangerous."" In fact, I believe in ""The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf says, ""No, with that power, ""I should have power too great and terrible. ""And over me, the Ring could gain a power ""still greater and more deadly. ""Do not tempt me!"" The characters say that, they do, but it's also about how they behave around the thing."
Language,"It's how the plot is shaped around this object and how a group of people come together to identify this Ring as a dangerous, magical artifact that needs to be destroyed for the good of the world. It's not just dialogue. It's also descriptions by the author and actions taken by the characters."
Language,"So let's go through some of the ways that an author can develop theme within a story, with the important caveat that you won't always be able to detect a theme in a text until you're already finished reading it for the first time. This, to me, is one of the great pleasures of rereading. You've already worked hard to get an understanding of the text, so now you can go back and pick up all the stuff you might not have noticed the first time."
Language,"So one way to develop theme is through the repeated use of a symbol or an object. The Ring in ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great example because characters are always talking about it. But it could really be anything, a design, an object, an animal. Imagine a story about a child who wants to grow up to be an engineer that develops airplanes. And throughout this story, birds keep showing up, birds on the protagonist's windowsill, her favorite teacher's bird earrings, maybe she has a best friend named Robin."
Language,"And from that, we can see the idea of flight is a theme in this story, and all of these bird-related things go back to this character's desire to take flight. Changes in setting are a fine way to develop themes. How is a location portrayed? How does it match with the way characters feel or behave when they appear in these locations? Imagine a character who desperately wants to be alone. So at a tense portion in the story, she flees to a distant mountaintop."
Language,"When she gets there, what's the weather like? Is it cold, snowy, and forbidding on the mountain? Is it an active volcano, bubbling with lava? Is it clear, peaceful, full of snowdrops and mountain goats? What would an author be trying to say with those decisions? How should we, the reader, feel about that character's solitude? If it's snowy and forbidding, is it a symbol of the character's coldness, of their hardening up? Does the volcano reflect the character's explosive potential? Or does the beauty of the lonely mountaintop mean this was the right decision for the character to take? Dialogue that repeatedly references a similar idea can be a way to develop theme."
Language,"When characters mention something a lot, it's probably because the author is thinking about it and maybe wanted to build it intentionally into the story. Imagine a teenager in Ancient Rome who's preoccupied with honor and his family name and how he's worried he won't live up to the achievements of his ancestors. If that's something that he's insecure about, he might think about it often or talk about the concept of honor or the social standing of his family."
Language,"You can also see this presented as explicit lessons by a sage character, usually older and wise. Think of Moana's grandmother or of Yoda. They'll say something explicit like, ""Go do the thing your heart wants, Moana,"" or, ""Trust that the energy of the universe ""will make you a really good space wizard, Luke."" I'm paraphrasing here. Or think of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" saying, ""There's no place like home."" She says it again and again. The words are so powerful that they're used as a magic spell."
Language,"And words so powerful that they become magic is really just another way to say theme. It doesn't need to be said aloud to be thematic. Some of the most powerful moments in storytelling come from action, not just dialogue. Momentous character decisions, like Maui giving up his powers to save Moana or Harry Potter's climactic battle with Voldemort, are chock-full of themes, self-sacrifice, the power of love, the importance of honesty. Some of these themes can be expressed without speaking a single word."
Language,"And I should be clear. Sometimes you need to finish the story before you can look back on it and understand how parts of it contribute to the theme. You might need to get some distance before you can see how all of the pieces fit together. If something really sticks with me, sometimes I like to go back and reread parts of a book once I've gotten a sense of its theme, to see how the author has threaded theme through the text."
Language,"Now, if you look very closely at the videos I make here at Khan Academy, if you really squint your eyes and listen carefully, you'll notice that all of them share the same theme, which is you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Once we've sussed out whose perspective a story or a poem is being told from, what's next? What else is there to talk about? Well, I think it's useful to remember that stories and poems don't just happen. They don't just suddenly, spontaneously exist. Creating them is work. And it's the result of a whole bunch of decisions made by a writer. So, who is the point-of-view character or characters? What does that mean for the story? Ultimately, a point of view is an author's decision."
Language,"So, when an author chooses to center a story on one character, how does that change the story they tell? Would the story be different if it were centered on a different character? How does that point of view impact the way the story gets told? Imagine a rocket scientist with a mouse in her pocket, and they're going to inspect a spaceship under construction."
Language,"I'm gonna give you two little snippets in what's called close third person perspective, where there's a narrator, but their point of view is attached to a character. We get to see through their eyes, experience their thoughts. So, first, we're gonna hear from the rocket scientist. ""Leaving the lab, Dr. Harper strode confidently ""into the spaceship hangar, ""clipboard in hand, pet mouse in pocket."
Language,"""Launch day was only eight months away, ""and Project Juno still had so many bugs to work out, ""but she was certain that the test she'd conduct today ""would help her solve the air filter problem. ""The starship sat before her in a pool of light, ""a deep bluish-black craft, ""once an idea that had lived only in her mind, ""but now it was a real physical object. ""She dug around in her pocket ""and fed Persephone a sunflower seed."" Now, let's take that again from the mouse's perspective. ""Persephone T."
Language,"Mouse ""clung to the lip of Tatiana's jacket pocket, ""as they passed from a small cold room ""into a much larger, warmer, and brighter room. ""It had been four hours since she'd had anything to eat, ""and she was cranky. ""In the middle of the big, bright room ""was a big bluish black shape. ""Persophone didn't know what it was, ""and frankly, it looked kind of like a bird, ""which was weird and a little frightening."
Language,"""But it hadn't moved ""the last time Persephone and Tatiana were in there, ""and it wasn't moving now. ""So, Persephone guessed it was asleep. ""She chirped impatiently, ""and Tatiana gave her a sunflower seed."" You see, the same things happen in each story. Dr. Harper goes from her lab to the spaceship hangar, and then, she feeds her pet mouse a sunflower seed. But when we hang out with Harper's perspective, we get her thoughts and we see what she thinks is important."
Language,"But when we're reading from Persephone the mouse's perspective, she doesn't care about the spaceship, she doesn't know what it is. As readers, it's useful to ask how a writer is developing a character's point of view through a story. What are the abilities and limitations of a point-of-view character? Persephone the mouse is small. She can sneak through little holes in the wall or hide in the jacket pocket of a consenting human being. But Dr."
Language,"Harper has, you know, an astrophysics doctorate and opposable thumbs. She can open doors, design a spaceship, plan its flight trajectory. This is kind of an extreme example because one of these characters is a human being and the other one is a mouse. But even among different people, we can imagine very different stories. Characters and stories are just like real people. They have strengths and weaknesses, knowledge about some things and ignorance about others."
Language,"Sometimes, they tell the truth, and sometimes, they lie. This is especially important in first-person books, where everything we read comes to us directly from the point-of-view character. You have to open yourself up to the possibility that the narrator can be wrong about stuff. They can perceive things incorrectly, or be blinded by their own assumptions, or just be confused. They could also just be lying. But they could also just be innocently wrong and confused."
Language,They could look at a spaceship and think it's a bird. Narrators that are wrong or misinformed or actively trying to trick you are called unreliable narrators. Reading a book narrated by an unreliable narrator turns the relatively straightforward process of reading into a tug of war.
Language,"How do I know I can trust what the narrator is telling me? Ask yourself, what does a narrator think? What do they feel and what do they do? When you can answer all of those questions, you can begin to put their perspective into words. If you can identify the biases or the perspective or the ignorance of a point-of-view character, you can start to correct for it as you read, and use that understanding of the point of view to better understand the story as a whole."
Language,"Something important to remember is that the storytelling character is not the same thing as the author. The author creates those characters and is literally the person who writes the words. But if I wrote a story about an ogre who eats children, that does not make me an ogre who eats children. I would never eat children. They taste horrible. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"But I think it is unwise to think of it as a one-way conversation. The best arguments do not plunge forward heedlessly. They do not steamroll opposition. Rather, they seek out opposing arguments and incorporate them. Good readers pay attention to how authors acknowledge opposing viewpoints in an argument. Doing this makes it easier to decide how well thought out an argument is and determine whether the author is knowledgeable and thoughtful in their position."
Language,"Now, I do not practice the martial art of Wing Chun. But that style of self-defense is famous for techniques that block and strike at the same time. Your opponent's fist comes in, you redirect it away from your body, and in that same motion continue your momentum into its own immediate counterstrike. Acknowledging the existence of opposing viewpoints has two main applications, which are pretty different."
Language,"First, maybe you're not on any side of the argument and you wish to straightforwardly describe the conflict, like a journalist reporting on a lawsuit. It's a journalist's responsibility to truthfully portray the full scope of information on a topic, bringing every piece of relevant and plausible information to bear. The author provides equal time to the disputants and tries not to provide their own opinion here. That could look like this. Ms. Adeyemi contended that Mr."
Language,"Dupont stole the cookies from her cookie jar, and that furthermore, she had baked those cookies in the first place, thus strengthening her claim to the said cookies. Of the 24 cookies baked by Ms. Adeyemi, she alleges that 10 of them were taken by Mr. Dupont. Mr. Dupont, however, contended that as he was the person who made the cookie jar for Ms. Adeyemi in the ceramics class he took, he is entitled to the occasional cookie."
Language,"He does not dispute the 10-cookie figure, adding only that they were ""delicious."" Judge Huang, upon reviewing testimony from both parties, sided with Ms. Adeyemi, saying that you are not entitled to a cookie just for being a good friend one time, and that next time, Mr. Dupont should ask for permission. Now, looking at that situation, my personal opinion is that it is inappropriate to steal your friend's cookies. An opinion that any right-thinking person should share."
Language,"But injecting opinion may not be appropriate in all cases. So okay, that's the first case. Reporting on multiple sides of a dispute without getting involved yourself. Now, the second reason, the second application for including opposing viewpoints in an argumentative piece of writing is that Wing Chun thing, the block as you strike technique."
Language,"It makes your argument stronger if you anticipate possible objections to it, address them, and strike them down all the while still making your argument in the first place. Let's take this example from the website. This piece is about the lost colony at Roanoke. A bunch of English settlers disappeared under uncertain circumstances for reasons still unknown. And the author's trying to make the case that although theories for the disappearance exist, the truth is still beyond our grasp."
Language,"So in order to make that case, they address several different theories that attempt to explain the disappearance. Many people have tried to solve the mystery of the lost colony. Historians and archeologists have searched for answers for hundreds of years. Some possible solutions are: A, Native people killed the colonists on Roanoke Island. B, the colonists were all killed on Roanoke Island by disease. C, their town was washed away by a hurricane, and the people drowned."
Language,"Or D, they all left Roanoke Island and went to live in some other place. Now, watch what the author does as they systematically go through each theory and address it. I've only excepted the first two, so let's look at those first two. A, when John White got back to Roanoke Island in 1590 he did not find any bones or bodies or any signs of fighting. Bones last a long time. If Native people had killed the colonists, there would probably have been some remains or other signs of violence."
Language,"We can guess that the colonists were not killed on Roanoke Island. B, when the English first came to Virginia, they're using a 16th-century spelling, they brought diseases with them, such as flu and smallpox, that were new to the Native communities. They had no immunity against them and many died very quickly. Letters written by the colonists tell us that the English remained healthy. And remember, no bones or bodies or graves were found. We can guess that the colonists did not all die of disease."
Language,"So the author's saying that these events are unlikely, taking the theories seriously, and then thinking them through to their conclusions. But demonstrating why they don't seem very likely explanations. Why do they think it's unlikely that Native people killed those colonists? There aren't any remains or signs of combat. Why does it seem unlikely that they died of diseases? There are no graves or remains. The thesis is, nobody knows why."
Language,"Here are two counters to it basically saying here's why, and the author says here's why these are unlikely to be true which weakens those counterarguments and strengthens the original. Block, strike. My overall point is this. Don't ignore the potential counters to your argument. Incorporate them, analyze them, and redirect their energy into your own position. And when you read, notice if the author is acknowledging counters or ignoring them. If they ignore them, you should be suspicious."
Language,"Why are they ignoring them? If you can answer that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"""This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why."" Argument does not sneak, it does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories: data, fact, observable reality. There is a place for pure subjective opinion, and it is the realm of the movie and the restaurant review."
Language,"""I did not like this movie because I didn't laugh at its jokes."" ""I did not enjoy the hamburger I got because I found it too dry for my liking."" This is not what we're talking about today. Obviously, argument is rooted in opinion and subjective personal preferences, but those opinions need to be backed up with evidence. Let's compare arguments for and against a tax on soda."
Language,"Now, this writer argues that sugar contributes to obesity, and therefore, people should be prevented from buying soda, which is full of sugar on the grounds that it is bad for them, let's take a look. The soda tax could alter many people's behavior, causing them to stop buying sugary drinks. Some foods are necessities like milk, eggs, and bread. People will buy them even if the prices increase. Sugary drinks aren't necessary."
Language,"If the price goes up, people will buy fewer sugary drinks and they won't be consuming as much sugar, therefore, the obesity rate will go down. Whereas this author counters that people have a right to make what they see as unhealthy decisions. Soda and other sugary drinks have been targeted because they lack nutrition and are basically just liquid sugar. Most people would agree that proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
Language,"However, do legislators have the right or responsibility to regulate people's sugar intake in order to improve their health? I say, no. All right, let's evaluate these claims. For the first argument in favor of the soda tax, how do we know this is true? What evidence does this author give that this tax will alter people's behavior? What evidence does this author give that sugary drinks aren't seen to be as essential as milk? After all, not everyone can or does drink milk."
Language,"In the piece, the evidence that the author gives us is this table, which shows how much sugar is in soda per serving, but it doesn't use evidence to connect sugar consumption to unhealthy outcomes. All this says is, soda has a lot of sugar. I wanna see evidence, I wanna see studies. How do we know this tax would change behavior? Good readers think through the impacts of an argument."
Language,"If this tax went into effect, what would the consequences be? Are there faults in the author's logic? It might stop some people from buying soda, but in an unfair way. Here's how I'm processing this as a reader. If you take a bottle of soda that previously costs, say $2, and the tax makes it $10, that will make it more difficult to purchase. But to a millionaire, the difference between $2 and $10 is basically nothing. Whereas to a poor or middle class person, that $8 difference adds up pretty quickly."
Language,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary."
Language,"So now I'm asking, whose responsibility is it to determine how much sugar is in a drink? Why is sugar so inexpensive to begin with? Do legislators have a responsibility there? Now we know it's not legal to bottle rat poison and sell it as tea, but whose responsibility is that? What isn't this author saying, and how does not saying it serve their argument? They're not saying what the government could or should do, only what it shouldn't do."
Language,"And this is why I want you to be skeptical whenever you read anyone's argument about anything. You need to figure out what the terms of the debate are. What does the argument assume as a given? What's a problem worth fixing? What are the trade offs that the writer thinks are acceptable? So when you encounter an argument in text, look for the claims, and then look to see if those claims are backed up with data-supported reasoning."
Language,"Is the author using evidence and logic? Do they anticipate objections to their arguments and push back on or incorporate those critiques? Above all else, I want you to remain skeptical. Everyone's selling something, even me. It's just the thing I'm trying to sell you is the fundamental idea that you can learn anything. You've got this, Readers. David out.."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word.

How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"It is a giant robot made up of five smaller robots, each one piloted by a person. Five friends, each with control over a different part of the robot's body. You're up in the head, I'm operating the right leg, our buddy's operating the left, and so on. In order to walk or pick up objects or fight space monsters the size of battleships, all the disparate of the robot have to function together. Well, texts work much the same way."
Language,"Each portion of the text, from the section level down to more granular divisions like individual paragraphs or sentences, is trying to serve the broader point of the text. When we look at Voltron's foot in motion, we analyze what the foot is doing in the service of Voltron as a whole."
Language,"If Voltron's foot kicks a ball, we have to zoom out to ask, is Voltron playing soccer? This is a pretty abstract idea without any text examples, so let's stop talking about space robots and start talking about the Armor of 10th-century Japanese horse archers. All right, so this whole passage is about the armor worn by mounted archer samurai of 10th-century Japan, o-yoroi, and how it's constructed. So this is a piece of o-yoroi armor. This is the whole assemblage."
Language,"And that's how the piece is divided, right? We've got the sections here for each component. The cuirass, the o-sode or shoulder guards, the kusazuri, or armored skirt, and the kabuto, the helmet. And each one of these elements of the armor connects back to the whole point of the piece, which is describing how the armor does two things. One, it protects the wearer, and two, allows them to ride horses and fire arrows. Now we see this in the introductory paragraph."
Language,"Their armor, called o-yoroi, was designed specifically to withstand the demands of mounted archer warfare. So let's dig into this first section about the cuirass, the breastplate and backplate armor. I'll read the first paragraph. ""A cuirass is usually a piece of armor ""that consists of a breastplate and a backplate ""that are attached together. ""The cuirass for the o-yoroi was a bit different ""than a typical cuirass, ""as it was designed to be more effective for an archer."
Language,"""The o-yoroi cuirass had three sections instead of two. ""A section to protect the back, ""a section to protect the chest, ""and a section to protect the left side body. ""The right side was left open ""so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow."" So this paragraph is describing what a cuirass is and how it functions as armor, but then it goes into detailing how an o-yoroi cuirass is different because it's for someone holding a bow, right? It has three sections instead of two."
Language,"The right side was left open so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow. This information down to the sentence level all serves the same purpose. It serves to answer the question, how was o-yoroi armor specifically designed to meet the needs of a mounted archer? Not every sentence or every paragraph will address every part of that main question. Note that the cuirass section doesn't cover anything about how the archers are on horseback."
Language,"To answer that question, we need to go down to the third section, the kusazuri, the battle skirt. I'm not gonna read the whole paragraph. Let's just zoom in on this one sentence. ""The kusazuri were designed so that when the warrior ""was sitting in his horse's saddle, ""they fit nicely over the saddle in a skirtlike fashion ""to protect his lower body and upper legs."" This particular sentence tells us how this part of the armor protects the samurai's legs while they're on horseback."
Language,The paragraph and section it's part of detail the whole construction of that part of the armor and how it relates to the other pieces. And all of those paragraphs together form one text that explained the thing it set out to explain. What is o-yoroi and how does it work for 10th-century horse archer samurai? Each section or paragraph is like a leg or an arm of Voltron. Each sentence is a muscle or a finger or a robo-toe.
Language,"Together, moving as one, they tell a story or make an argument, which I guess is like Voltron winning a fight, maybe. I feel like I've carried this metaphor as far as it'll go. The point is, if you're having trouble making sense of an informational text, think of it as a giant battle robot. What is each of component part of the text trying to accomplish? And when you put all those parts together, what are they trying to do? Well, my work here is done. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"It's like a series of jumps. Listening to myself say that, it doesn't feel very clear to me. At least it's certainly less clear than this moving image of a galloping horse. Sometimes the most efficient way to express information is to present it visually, to see it in order to best understand it. And so we're going to talk today about graphs and charts, your friends and mine. This video is no longer about horses. I apologize if I gave that impression."
Language,"I did give a pretty obvious title when I said quantitative information in texts. But to those of you who I've misled, I'm sorry. Now, graphs are one of many ways we can make visual representations of data, information you can see, news you can use. And I guess a question that follows from that is why do it? Why make a graph and a chart? What does that have to do with writing? Well, visualizing data can make an argument stronger."
Language,"Let's say my neighborhood is having a bake sale to raise money for, I don't know, a carnival. And some of my neighbors have peanut allergies, so I want to write to the neighborhood council to say let's make sure that the baked goods don't have peanuts in them so the whole neighborhood can participate without fear of having an allergic attack. That's supposed to be a peanut. I realize it kinda looks like a dog treat, but let's pretend that's a peanut."
Language,"Now, good readers know that data is important to informational text, so as a writer, I wanna make sure that I'm backing up my claims with a chart. Here's the text of the letter I'd send to my neighborhood council: Dear Neighborhood Council, I'm writing to ask that you officially ban peanuts and tree nuts from the baked goods on offer during our upcoming carnival bake sale. Over a fifth of residents surveyed reported some kind of food allergy. Please see attached graph."
Language,"If we want to have their full participation in this fundraiser, we cannot permit foods that will send them to the hospital. All my best, David. Now, let's take a look at that graph. These are made-up numbers in a made-up situation. But let's say I interviewed 50 of my neighbors, and 40 of them here report no allergies, but 10 of them do. So we can have this bar graph that breaks down those allergies by type. One person is allergic to strawberries. Two people are allergic to peanuts."
Language,"Four people are allergic to tree nuts, like pecans or walnuts. And three people have multiple food allergies. And then we have this bar here that shows all the folks that don't have food allergies. That's the other 40. To put it another way, here's a pie chart of that same data set showing just how many people in the neighborhood have allergies in total. It's just a different way of looking at it."
Language,"This is all the same data, but we can see that the percentage of people surveyed who have allergies adds up to 20% of the total. Something that's in the letter but not the graphs is the idea that these are very serious allergies. If the wrong person ate a peanut, they could have a medical emergency. If the council were to look at just the graph alone, they might say, ""Eh, it's not that many people. ""Peanuts are great, let's include them."" But combined with the text, the stakes become more clear."
Language,And they may better understand the consequences of having nuts at the bake sale. And something that's in the graph that isn't in the letter is the breakdown of allergies by type. Maybe the council could decide that the one person with a strawberry allergy is an acceptable risk and that strawberry baked goods are kind of obvious-looking and easy to avoid in a way that brownies with walnuts in them aren't.
Language,"This visual information allows the neighborhood council to get my point more efficiently than just the words alone. It helps me express a sort of complicated idea that peanuts and other allergens in the bake sale might constitute too much of a risk to my neighbors and that they shouldn't be allowed. Now, there are other questions like is this a representative data set? But that's a question that can be better answered by our statistics course. For now, think about it this way."
Language,"As a reader, your job is to look at everything that is on the page, not just the text. Then think about what both the data and the words do for your understanding. Data and informational text are two great tastes that go great together. One can support the other and vice versa, you know, like chocolate and peanut butter. Oh, no, sorry, bad example, like chocolate and sunflower butter. You know what I mean. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"I don't literally mean that I've got a bear. That would be extremely sweet. Love a bear, love bear's whole thing with the snacking and the sleeping and the eating of fish, but no. A bear of is a figurative expression that means something difficult. So a bear of a lesson is a difficult lesson and that's what we're talking about today. Not bears, sorry, but non-literal uses of language, which we call figurative language or figures of speech. Figurative language says one thing but means another."
Language,"I could say that my colleague Allison is an eagle-eyed editor and when I say that I don't mean that she literally has an eagle's eyes in her head. That would be a terrifying achievement of medical science. No, I'm saying that she is sharp and attentive in the same way that an eagle is. So I'm saying something that is not literally true in order to express something that is true, that Allison is good at editing. Would you call that a lie? I'm not sure I would."
Language,"It's just a non-literal way of expressing myself. So, having gotten the question of whether or not I'm a dirty rotten liar out of the way, let's talk about some different varieties of figurative language. First, the simile. A simile is a comparison between two things that uses like or as. If I were really hungry, I could say that my stomach was gurgling like a tar pit or that I was as hungry as a ravenous wolf, and again, neither of these things are literally true."
Language,"If my stomach were making actual tar pit noises, I would probably need to go to a hospital. But what do those examples tell you about the way that I, the speaker, think about my hunger? Animals and people get stuck in tar pits, they're gloppy, they pull things into them, they slow things down. Sorry T-Rex. Therefore, I'm saying that my hunger is slowing me down. Or, if I'm comparing myself to a wolf, you can imagine me looking lean and desperate, saliva dripping from my jaws at the mere thought of food."
Language,"I could really go for a cheese danish come to think of it. So that's simile. The second figure of speech I wanna talk about today is the metaphor. And what's a metaphor? Cows and sheep! Sorry, I couldn't help it. No, a metaphor is not a meadow for. Metaphors are another way of comparing two things, but this time there's no like or as. We're walking this language tightrope without a net now."
Language,"You aren't signaling with like or as that you're making a figurative comparison, so you have to use context to communicate clearly. At the beginning of this video I said this was going to be a bear of a lesson. That's a metaphor. There's a Linda Ronstadt country song from the 70s, called ""Love is a Rose,"" which is all about how to take care of a relationship through the metaphor of tending a flower with thorns on it."
Language,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person."
Language,"To say that differently, it's ascribing human characteristics to non-living things. The wind howled through the mountains. The car grumbled as I threw it into gear. The storm raged. These are things that people do, but I'm applying that language to inanimate things, like wind and cars and storms in order to express the way these things are behaving. The car is not literally grumbling, ""Aw man, I can't believe David has to drive me today."" It's making noises that I am choosing to identify as unhappy."
Language,"The greatest kind of figurative language in the entire universe is hyperbole. By exaggerating, I'm expressing emphasis and importance. This summer, I'm going to read a million books and eat a literal actual ton of hot dogs. This is not true. In fact, this is impossible. That is too many hot dogs, those are too many books, each of which are sentences I never expected to say, but I'm trying to express my enthusiasm for both books and encased meats, and I'm doing that by being, you know, extra."
Language,"The final kind of expressive language I wanna talk about today isn't exactly figurative language, it's the language of allusions and references. Where you make comparisons to characters or events from literature, or movies, or culture. Also note that it's allusion with an A, as opposed to illusion with an I. An illusion with an I is like a magic trick. Here are some examples of allusions. Oh, you'd have to be Superman to lift that fallen tree. Or, you have a Gollum-like obsession with that stuffed animal."
Language,"Now these comparisons only work if the person you're talking to understands the reference. Superman has super strength, Gollum, from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" can't stop talking about how much he loves this one object, the ring. If you don't know the reference, then it's all just noise. One tip is to read up on mythology. You'd be surprised how many times ancient gods, like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo come up as you read. So that's what we're working with here. Simile, love is like a rose."
Language,"Metaphor, love is a rose. Personification, my car grumbled. Hyperbole, my mom grounded me for eight trillion years. And allusion, I feel mightier than Hercules. That's figurative language folks. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Tone communicates how an author feels about the topic they're writing about, this can come across in a number of different ways, it can reflect their enthusiasm or skepticism, it can also communicate formality or informality, an academic paper or a speech before the UN, for example are very different things from a toast at a wedding or a thank you card for a birthday gift and this kind of difference in tone is something that sociologists and linguists call register."
Language,"Social conventions and customs call for different registers in different circumstances, just as it would be inappropriate in most situations to wear a tuxedo at the beach, so too would it be incongruous to use extremely formal language in an informal setting? (melodic orchestral music) (clearing throat) Dear honored sir, it was the privilege of my very life to have you attend my 14th birthday party. I am grateful beyond words for your most generous gift, a check for $36 American."
Language,"Your humble and obedient servant, David. In fact using extremely formal language and high-minded gratitude for something as relatively small as a birthday gift might even come across as sarcastic or insulting. But this is sort of an extreme example, let's pull back and discuss how an understanding of tone can aid you in making sense of informational texts."
Language,"One great way to do that is to analyze word choice, we can look at a writer's language and determine their attitude towards the subject based on the words they've chosen to describe it. Oceans of ink have been spilled over comparisons between a Chicago style hotdog and a New York style hotdog. The first with its garden's worth of toppings, but a holier than now prohibition of ketchup, the latter with its sauerkraut, mustard and dubious dirty water cooking style."
Language,"But scant attention, a droplet of ink before the ocean has been paid to the half-smoke, the unsung but mighty regional sausage of Washington DC. Now how does the author think about the subject? Well, we know that they think that not enough writing has been done about DC's regional sausage, the half-smoke, but how do they feel about it? How do the words they use express their feelings? Let's break it down bit by bit."
Language,"So right out of the gate, we have oceans of ink, this is a deliberate piece of overstatement, there are no literal oceans made of ink, but it's being set up in opposition to the droplet of ink used to describe half-smokes later in the paragraph."
Language,"Half-smokes are described as unsung, but mighty, which suggests that they haven't been given their due, there hasn't been enough praise for half-smokes and that therefore the amount of attention given to Chicago and New York hotdogs is unfair or even disproportionate. I think we can also determine from word choice, that the author thinks a Chicago hot dog is a little ridiculous and that a New York hot dog is a little gross."
Language,"How do we know this? Chicagoans generally don't like ketchup on their hotdogs and the way the author phrases this is by saying, that they have a holier than thou prohibition on ketchup, which is to say they get all haughty and upset about it, which is weird because it's ketchup, listen, I'm a Chicagoan by birth, I used to feel this way and I'm not even sure why."
Language,"Similarly the word dubious in the description of the New York hotdog, meaning doubtful suggests that the dirty water cooking method is kind of nasty sounding, why would the author do this? Is it to say these are terrible hot dogs and nobody should eat them? No, I don't think so, The author is trying to make room for the half-smoke in the national sausage conversation and to do that, they're first trying to dismantle the importance of New York and Chicago style by making fun of them."
Language,"These are tactical choices, not to be confused with authorial voice, which is a different concept entirely an author's voice is their style, it's much more consistent across topics, whereas a tone is specific to a topic. So I might have an authorial voice, that uses a lot of goofy wordplay, but I use a sympathetic tone to talk about bears and a hostile tone to talk about, I don't know, whales, yeah, boo whales, I said it. I do not actually hate whales, I love whales."
Language,"But my point is this, use your knowledge of words, of the connotation and implications of the language, that an author might use to unlock your understanding of their tone, because if you can do that, my friend, you can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"It doesn't contain violence, obscenity or profanity. Or even anything that wouldn't appear in a G-rated movie, but it will contain explicit evidence. Yes, we're talking about citing evidence in literary analysis. When you're talking about a text and making arguments about it, in order to successfully build that argument, you must make inferences and draw conclusions. And those must be built on the back of evidence."
Language,"Both explicit, that is stated in the text, or implicit or based on clues or evidence in the text. So your responsibility is to tie those conclusions or inferences back to explicit or implicit evidence in the text. It can't just be, ""This is a feeling I have."" It has to be, ""My feeling about this is backed up by this specific evidence."" Say you're trying to be make an argument in a book that the captain of this pirate ship, let's just say, I guess, he's a birdman. That's what I drew, he's a birdman."
Language,"He's really unkind to the main character in the beginning of the book, but changes by the end of the book and treats everyone, including the main character with respect and courtesy. So I'm gonna write that my argument is that the captain's behavior changes towards the MC, the main character. I have to back that assertion up with evidence. So how do we find those details? First, you have to seek out parts of the book where the captain and the main character interact."
Language,"Then look closely at the pros and dialogue. What are the details that prove your point? Which are the strongest, most specific details that say, ""Oh, yes, here is where the captain is being mean. Here is where the captain is being respectful."" If you can't find evidence for your assertion, first, try searching in a different part of the book. Or importantly, acknowledge the possibility that you might have a weak argument."
Language,"Maybe it's time to start over and find a new or different argument to make and find support for. Once you've assembled your evidence work it into your analysis. ""Captain Bigsby is dismissive and rude to Eniola when she first joins the crew of the pirate ship Albatross,"" I might say. And then back it up with an explicit example of Captain Bigsby being dismissive and rude with a page number citation like so."
Language,"On page 34 of ""To the Burbling Deep,"" Bigsby says to Eniola, ""You there, what's her name! These portholes need to be scrubbed yesterday. Get to work!."" ""Yes, sir, Captain,"" Eniola said. ""But my name is-"" ""Does it look like I care?"" the captain snarled. But by the end of the story, when Eniola has proven her worth, saved the day, and humbled the captain, he treats her, and everyone around him, with much greater respect and deference."
Language,"On page 225, after Bigsby tends to Eniola's broken leg, he tells her, ""Eniola, that was some mighty fine pirating you did. You showed no fear when you punched that kraken, and more importantly, you showed no fear when you stood up to me. I was wrong, and I have been a jerk, and I am sorry."" Now both of those examples use explicit evidence where Captain Bigsby is being a jerk and then when he is apologizing for being a jerk. There's also implicit evidence too. Bigsby tends to Eniola's broken leg."
Language,"So while he's not saying, ""I will take care of you little buddy,"" with his words, he is saying it with his actions. And in that first example when he demands that Eniola clean the portholes, he's not literally saying, ""I'm impatient,"" But by saying, ""They need to be scrubbed yesterday,"" as an immediately because you already messed up, he's implying that he's impatient. Now there is no such book that I know of about a kraken punching girl pirate. But if we're lucky, my friend Jordan will write one."
Language,"Remember to use strong details to get good evidence. There might be a part of ""To The Burbling Deep"" where Captain Bigsby huffs angrily at Eniola but doesn't say anything, and that's mean or, at least, impolite, but it's not as strong as him yelling at her. So when you find the detail, ask yourself, how does that detail related back to your analysis or your argument."
Language,"Is it repeated? Does that detail or detail similar to it appear elsewhere in the text? And if you see a lot of similar details, how do those details prove the argument that you're trying to make? If you have a sense of what the central idea or ideas of the text is, try to connect those details back to that central idea and then connect that central idea to your own argument. I don't know what ""To the Burbling Deep"" is about 'cause I made it up 20 minutes ago."
Language,"But maybe one theme in it is that it's important to recognize the potential with another people. And that can be both true for Eniola who becomes a hero and punches a giant octopus monster, but it can also be true of Captain Bigsby who occupies kind of antagonistic role and then changes through the story. And so we can build our argument around that idea that character change is possible. Not just for the main character, but for everybody. So that's where I will leave you."
Language,"Remember to choose the pieces of evidence that give you the strongest support for your idea and if the evidence doesn't match your idea, you might need to change the idea itself. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"How do we know that though? How did J. R. R. Tolkien, as an author, develop that theme in the text? How can we go deeper, beyond that headline of the Ring equals the dangers of absolute power? Good readers can look at a whole text from beginning to end and identify where the author purposefully chose words, included details, or directed action that develops or reveals the overall theme."
Language,"It's not just that characters say, ""Oh, no, the Ring's super-dangerous."" In fact, I believe in ""The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf says, ""No, with that power, ""I should have power too great and terrible. ""And over me, the Ring could gain a power ""still greater and more deadly. ""Do not tempt me!"" The characters say that, they do, but it's also about how they behave around the thing."
Language,"It's how the plot is shaped around this object and how a group of people come together to identify this Ring as a dangerous, magical artifact that needs to be destroyed for the good of the world. It's not just dialogue. It's also descriptions by the author and actions taken by the characters."
Language,"So let's go through some of the ways that an author can develop theme within a story, with the important caveat that you won't always be able to detect a theme in a text until you're already finished reading it for the first time. This, to me, is one of the great pleasures of rereading. You've already worked hard to get an understanding of the text, so now you can go back and pick up all the stuff you might not have noticed the first time."
Language,"So one way to develop theme is through the repeated use of a symbol or an object. The Ring in ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great example because characters are always talking about it. But it could really be anything, a design, an object, an animal. Imagine a story about a child who wants to grow up to be an engineer that develops airplanes. And throughout this story, birds keep showing up, birds on the protagonist's windowsill, her favorite teacher's bird earrings, maybe she has a best friend named Robin."
Language,"And from that, we can see the idea of flight is a theme in this story, and all of these bird-related things go back to this character's desire to take flight. Changes in setting are a fine way to develop themes. How is a location portrayed? How does it match with the way characters feel or behave when they appear in these locations? Imagine a character who desperately wants to be alone. So at a tense portion in the story, she flees to a distant mountaintop."
Language,"When she gets there, what's the weather like? Is it cold, snowy, and forbidding on the mountain? Is it an active volcano, bubbling with lava? Is it clear, peaceful, full of snowdrops and mountain goats? What would an author be trying to say with those decisions? How should we, the reader, feel about that character's solitude? If it's snowy and forbidding, is it a symbol of the character's coldness, of their hardening up? Does the volcano reflect the character's explosive potential? Or does the beauty of the lonely mountaintop mean this was the right decision for the character to take? Dialogue that repeatedly references a similar idea can be a way to develop theme."
Language,"When characters mention something a lot, it's probably because the author is thinking about it and maybe wanted to build it intentionally into the story. Imagine a teenager in Ancient Rome who's preoccupied with honor and his family name and how he's worried he won't live up to the achievements of his ancestors. If that's something that he's insecure about, he might think about it often or talk about the concept of honor or the social standing of his family."
Language,"You can also see this presented as explicit lessons by a sage character, usually older and wise. Think of Moana's grandmother or of Yoda. They'll say something explicit like, ""Go do the thing your heart wants, Moana,"" or, ""Trust that the energy of the universe ""will make you a really good space wizard, Luke."" I'm paraphrasing here. Or think of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" saying, ""There's no place like home."" She says it again and again. The words are so powerful that they're used as a magic spell."
Language,"And words so powerful that they become magic is really just another way to say theme. It doesn't need to be said aloud to be thematic. Some of the most powerful moments in storytelling come from action, not just dialogue. Momentous character decisions, like Maui giving up his powers to save Moana or Harry Potter's climactic battle with Voldemort, are chock-full of themes, self-sacrifice, the power of love, the importance of honesty. Some of these themes can be expressed without speaking a single word."
Language,"And I should be clear. Sometimes you need to finish the story before you can look back on it and understand how parts of it contribute to the theme. You might need to get some distance before you can see how all of the pieces fit together. If something really sticks with me, sometimes I like to go back and reread parts of a book once I've gotten a sense of its theme, to see how the author has threaded theme through the text."
Language,"Now, if you look very closely at the videos I make here at Khan Academy, if you really squint your eyes and listen carefully, you'll notice that all of them share the same theme, which is you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Understanding the plot of a story is essential to writing about it. You can't write about a story if you can't express what happened in it. So what I want to do today is talk about creating objective summaries of texts. Summaries that are free of opinion, or non biased. If you're summarizing a book, you wanna get across the events of the story. Objectivity is hard and weird and has a very specific purpose. You use it to build the bones of your analysis."
Language,"Once you've got the structure in place, bring opinions back. Here are the facts and now here's what I think about those facts. Let me be clear, opinions are good. Opinions are where analysis lives. The whole field of literary criticism would be awfully boring if nobody ever held opinions but all that criticism rests on a basis of objectively summarized texts. So let's talk about how to do just that, how to objectively summarize a text. Here's what you need to do."
Language,"Step one, read the thing you want to summarize. You can't do one without the other. Step two, ask yourself, what are the important parts of this story? Not the interesting parts, not the cool parts, but the most essential parts of the story. Remember we're trying to be objective here so it's not about including the parts you especially liked. So who are the main characters, where does the story take place, what happens in the plot? Step three, pare it down."
Language,"Look at all those important parts you listed, and cut out everything that isn't absolutely essential. Major characters only, setting, conflict, climax, resolution. Step four, put it in order. Write it all out as sentences in the order the plot happened in. The idea is to be able to summarize a whole story in a handful of sentences, like a single five sentence paragraph. And you're gonna wanna paraphrase here."
Language,"Whatever you need to say, say it in your own words so you can get it across as quickly as possible. Ordinarily, I'd say quoting from the text is an important skill but this is one time you won't use it. All right so, those are the four steps. To demonstrate, I'm gonna take a fiction piece from a Khan Academy exercise and I'll go through that process with you. Step one, let's read it all, read this little story chunk. ""'Wilky!' Captain Martello bellowed below deck."
Language,"""'We need your help!' I climbed the ladder quickly ""and was astonished that I hadn't awakened on my own. ""Usually I could sense a storm brewing ""hours before it arrived. ""Captain Martello noticed my look of surprise. ""'She's coming on quick, this one. Here, grab the rope, ""Help me pull down the sail.' ""Overboard, the waters had changed. ""No longer were they an inviting green hue, ""they were dark, foreboding."
Language,"""The moon above tried to peek through the angry sky ""but the clouds kept hijacking her hopeful glow. ""Suddenly, a giant slow rolling wave ""forced my side of the vessel to dip into the water. ""I tried to hang on but the lurching wave was tugging at me. ""Captain Martello grabbed my leg ""and managed to yank me onto Adelina's salt sprayed deck. ""'You're safe,' he said firmly, 'for now.'"" Okay step two, what are the important parts of the story? Okay so Wilky comes on deck when Captain Martello asks him to."
Language,"They're on a boat. And note here that I'm just sort of scribbling down notes, these aren't even sentences. There's a storm coming that Wilky didn't predict. The captain tells Wilky to help him strike the sail. The water is a scary color, a wave nearly washes Wilky overboard but the captain saves him. Oh and the ship is called the Adelina. I think that's a neat name for a ship. All right step three, pare it down. So the fact that I think that Adelina is a neat name for a ship is opinion and not relevant."
Language,"It's also not super relevant that Wilky didn't predict the storm. Or that the water is a spooky color. So do we have all the important details in here? The name of the ship, check. The name of Wilky and Captain Martello, the fact that there is a storm. So part of this is relevant but not the prediction part and Wilky nearly being tossed overboard but saved by the captain. So step four, let's take all of that, put it in order. Start afresh, full sentences, okay."
Language,"Captain Martello calls Wilky up to the deck of the Adelina to help him prepare the ship for a sudden storm. Wilky is nearly washed overboard by a big wave but Martello saves them. That's our strategy, you see? Boil down the story to its essentials, strip away unnecessary detail and rephrase events in your own words in the order that they happened in. Once you've got that squared away, you're ready to back up that great big dump truck full of opinions. All right bring her in."
Language,"(truck backing up beeping) Let them have it, fellows. (crashing) You love to see it. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Who knows what, when, and what does that tell us? A writer can control which characters have access to information, and they can control what access you, the reader, or the viewer, have to information to. The information you have and the information the characters have help develop our perspectives. Within a story, conflict between characters can come from a difference in perspective."
Language,"In ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" the character of Prince Zuko is consumed by his desire to capture the avatar, as he feels that this will end his exile and restore him to a place of prominence at his father's side. His uncle Iroh, however, understands based on many years of hard experience, that Zuko's father is a cruel man who never intended to take his son back. Iroh only wants to keep his nephew safe. This difference in perspective generates a lot of conflict between the two of them."
Language,"The show slowly reveals Iroh's perspective over time. Whereas we, as viewers, know what Zuko wants and why almost immediately. In fiction, that kind of information asymmetry between the storyteller, the characters, and the audience, leads to something called dramatic irony. You're watching a play, or a TV show, or reading a book, and you, the audience, the reader, knows something that the characters don't."
Language,"This is possible because especially in a visual medium, the audience has a different point of view than the characters do. We can see things they don't see. This difference in point of view is what allows tension, suspense, and jokes. Remember, irony is just the difference between expectation and result. It can be leveraged to achieve anything that uses the mechanism of surprise. I don't wanna belabor how jokes work. Literally nothing is more boring or unfunny than explaining jokes."
Language,"So, let's use suspense as our example. Imagine a very low stakes villain, The Cheeseler, who goes around pranking people by balancing buckets of cottage cheese on doorframes. You go through the door, blam, you get cheesed. I want you to imagine a scene in which we see The Cheeseler booby trap the protagonist's door with a bucket of cottage cheese. Nobody else in the story is around to witness this. After all, The Cheeseler stands alone. And now, we see our hero in Tamika."
Language,"She's walking down the hall with such confidence, blindly unaware of the cheesy threat that awaits her when she opens that door. We come back to the cheese. It's still there, oh no, oh no Tamika. Do you see what I'm doing here? Do you see how this generates suspense? You, the viewer, know something the character doesn't know. The difference between her point of view and your point of view generates tension. This is something that writers do on purpose."
Language,"This tension, this dramatic irony, draws us in because it's very satisfying to see it resolved. We know that there's that possibility of Tamika getting splatted with cottage cheese, but what if Tamika, at the last moment, kicks open the door? The cheese bucket drops, and Tamika catches it neatly. Whoo, thank goodness. She saw that the door was slightly ajar and put it together. The tension is resolved as the gap closes between what Tamika knows and what we know."
Language,"When characters resolve interpersonal differences, it's through an alignment of their points of view. That's what brings us to resolution. The difference between two points of view can be reconciled, and that too, is a way of relieving story tension. Now, I'd like to counsel you against making blanket statements about specific genres of work, like sure, a first person story could limit the flow of information because we're perceiving a story through the senses of the point of view character."
Language,"But, in your analysis of that story, be sure to get specific. How does that specific character in that particular situation see events? Why does the author show us, the readers, information that character doesn't get to see? Asking yourself questions about those differences in perspective between the narration and characters, between two or more characters, between the text and the reader, will make it easy for you to analyze the impact of those decisions that the author made."
Language,"And now, I'm going to go walk my dog. I will see you all next time. You can learn anything, David out. All right. (humming) (metal clanking) Oh, curse you Cheeseler!."
Language,"You'll notice it has almost no words in it, at least in this form. Now, let me show you the script. Pages three and four, panel one. A double-page spread, the whole greenhouse revealed, in widescreen. It's glorious. Wisps of steam curl up from bubbling patches of pool, green kelpy tendrils twine up the sides of the building. Everything is suffused with a delicate, green glow. Absent the gro-lights, some of the algae fluoresce in a range of cool-spectrum colors. But primarily greens."
Language,"Eugene is dwarfed by its almost cosmic magnificence. Caption, I can't describe it. None of that language, except for the caption, shows up in the final layout. All of that was me, the writer, giving art direction to Cour, the illustrator. Then they translated that language into their own version. I think it's a pretty faithful translation. My words are translated through Cour's design sensibilities and turned into artwork."
Language,"When you translate a written work into a different medium, whether it's illustrated, animated, recorded, or performed live it changes. It becomes a fundamentally different object. As readers, it's a valuable skill to explore how a text changes as it shifts from one medium to another. And when I say, medium, I mean a style of work, like a stage play, a film, a graphic novel, and audio drama, any of that. Good readers analyze those changes and use them to understand decisions that creators make."
Language,"If you're watching Romeo and Juliet and the director has made the decision to dress everyone in towering robot suits, a detail that is definitely not in the play as written, what does that decision tell you? What does it mean to you? Maybe you have had the experience of reading a book series that was important to you and then they made it into a movie and you were so excited to see the movie, and you sat down to see it and it was awful."
Language,"Like, they cast the wrong actors and they simplified the plot until it made no sense, and it just didn't feel right. That feeling is an example of this tension, this change, between a written material and its visual adaptation. Sometimes it can be bad, sometimes it can be good. Some readers can imagine what characters in books look or sound like, hearing them in their mind's ear, seeing them in their mind's eye."
Language,"The way your imagination renders a character is going to be different from how someone else's imagination does it. So let's compare the script for this audio drama we've got on Khan Academy, Hands Off My Phone, and let's compare that against the recorded version. So first, I'm going to put up the script and I'd like you to pause the video and just read it to yourself very quickly. And now let's take a listen to the recorded version. (upbeat music) (bell ringing) - [Sebastian] Oh no he didn't."
Language,"That is so harsh. - [Valentina] Right? - [Sebastian] Your dad took your phone away, just for getting a D on the history test? - [Valentina] Yep. - [Sebastian] My mind is blown. - [Valentina] Mine too. - [Sebastian] I mean, that was an easy test. - [Valentina] What? - [Sebastian] I can't believe you got a D. - [Valentina] Hey! That's not really-- - [Sebastian] And your dad is the school principal, and he took your phone away. Whoa. (chuckling) - [Valentina] You know, this isn't really helping."
Language,"- [Sebastian] Your life is so bleak right now. -    So you can read that script and think, oh hey, Sebastian is being earnestly sympathetic. Like, he really recognizes that his friend is hurting, but when you hear that performance the way I interpreted this line is that Sebastian is low-key roasting Valentina. He's not saying your life is so bleak in a kind way. He's rubbing salt into the wounds and being a dingus about it."
Language,"There's also other stuff that's not explicitly in the script like, that opening musical sting. (upbeat music) And the ringing of the bell. (bell ringing) Or those background school noises. All of that is meant to represent the fact that you're listening to a fictional show that takes place in a school setting. Does it work? That's for you to decide. When you watch or listen to a performance or a recording, or when you look at illustrations, ask yourself some questions."
Language,"For an audio piece, how do the sound effects, the acting decisions, and the music impact the story or affect the meaning of the words the characters say? How does the way an actor delivers a line change its emphasis? Was someone being sarcastic or sincere in a way you didn't expect, for example? For an illustrated story, how do those illustrations help you understand the author's tone and do you agree with those choices? Is the author's interpretation of the story the same as yours? For a TV show, or a movie, or a play, in addition to all the decisions made by actors about how to use their voices, shape their faces, or hold their bodies, how does the set tell the story? How do costumes tell the story? How does lighting or special effects impact the tone? For TV and film, how does the camera impact the way the story is told? The way a piece of film text is edited, its cuts, its angles, its rhythms, can help shape the way you, as a viewer, as a reader of visual text, understand it."
Language,"And if you can learn that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Right, if I'm on a train from Chicago to Pittsburgh, I can't simultaneously be on a train from Chicago to Omaha. So my body can't travel in two directions at once, but my mind can. What, what? I know, it is possible to think two ideas at the same time, ideas that are equally important but may not necessarily support one another. I can be thinking, it's hot outside and I'm late for my train, and those two ideas can have equal weight in my mind. The same thing can happen in texts."
Language,"An essay, or an argument, or a book can have two or more main ideas. It's a train that can go east to Pittsburgh and west to Omaha at the same time. This is a confusing idea."
Language,"When you look at an essay, you think, what's the main idea in this text? What is the author trying to tell me, or what position are they trying to convince me of? So how can there be room for more than one idea? How can we tell that a piece has two main ideas and not just one idea with supporting evidence? All right, here's an example of two main ideas. Sharks are deadly predators and fierce hunters."
Language,"They hunt with sharp teeth, incredibly sensitive noses, and the ability to sense the electrical current of a living body. Many people are afraid of sharks, because encounters with them can be fatal. That's paragraph one. However, sharks need to be protected, because they are important to ocean ecosystems. Their roles as high-level predators ensures that they maintain population levels of smaller fish, which in turn maintains the balance of ocean plant life."
Language,"If there were no sharks, algae could take over the ocean. Now, both of these paragraphs are about sharks. So in once sense, it's true that the passage as a whole is about sharks. Gonna just draw a little shark. He's so scary. Look at those very sharp teeth."
Language,"(laughs) Anyway, the topic is sharks, but what's the idea here in each paragraph? Paragraph one says, ""Sharks are deadly, and here is why."" And paragraph two says, ""It's because of their deadliness ""that they need to be protected, ""because big predator species balance ecosystems."" These are two ideas that are separate but interrelated. Sharks are deadly. Sharks need protecting."
Language,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas."
Language,"When you're considering whether or not there are two or more main ideas, ask yourself, are both x and y equally important understandings from this passage, or is it just one idea supporting another? So with this in mind, you too can learn to travel in two directions at once with the power of your mind and the power of reading. You can learn anything, David out. ♪ How can you be in two places at once ♪ ♪ When you're not anywhere at all ♪."
Language,"It's like a series of jumps. Listening to myself say that, it doesn't feel very clear to me. At least it's certainly less clear than this moving image of a galloping horse. Sometimes the most efficient way to express information is to present it visually, to see it in order to best understand it. And so we're going to talk today about graphs and charts, your friends and mine. This video is no longer about horses. I apologize if I gave that impression."
Language,"I did give a pretty obvious title when I said quantitative information in texts. But to those of you who I've misled, I'm sorry. Now, graphs are one of many ways we can make visual representations of data, information you can see, news you can use. And I guess a question that follows from that is why do it? Why make a graph and a chart? What does that have to do with writing? Well, visualizing data can make an argument stronger."
Language,"Let's say my neighborhood is having a bake sale to raise money for, I don't know, a carnival. And some of my neighbors have peanut allergies, so I want to write to the neighborhood council to say let's make sure that the baked goods don't have peanuts in them so the whole neighborhood can participate without fear of having an allergic attack. That's supposed to be a peanut. I realize it kinda looks like a dog treat, but let's pretend that's a peanut."
Language,"Now, good readers know that data is important to informational text, so as a writer, I wanna make sure that I'm backing up my claims with a chart. Here's the text of the letter I'd send to my neighborhood council: Dear Neighborhood Council, I'm writing to ask that you officially ban peanuts and tree nuts from the baked goods on offer during our upcoming carnival bake sale. Over a fifth of residents surveyed reported some kind of food allergy. Please see attached graph."
Language,"If we want to have their full participation in this fundraiser, we cannot permit foods that will send them to the hospital. All my best, David. Now, let's take a look at that graph. These are made-up numbers in a made-up situation. But let's say I interviewed 50 of my neighbors, and 40 of them here report no allergies, but 10 of them do. So we can have this bar graph that breaks down those allergies by type. One person is allergic to strawberries. Two people are allergic to peanuts."
Language,"Four people are allergic to tree nuts, like pecans or walnuts. And three people have multiple food allergies. And then we have this bar here that shows all the folks that don't have food allergies. That's the other 40. To put it another way, here's a pie chart of that same data set showing just how many people in the neighborhood have allergies in total. It's just a different way of looking at it."
Language,"This is all the same data, but we can see that the percentage of people surveyed who have allergies adds up to 20% of the total. Something that's in the letter but not the graphs is the idea that these are very serious allergies. If the wrong person ate a peanut, they could have a medical emergency. If the council were to look at just the graph alone, they might say, ""Eh, it's not that many people. ""Peanuts are great, let's include them."" But combined with the text, the stakes become more clear."
Language,And they may better understand the consequences of having nuts at the bake sale. And something that's in the graph that isn't in the letter is the breakdown of allergies by type. Maybe the council could decide that the one person with a strawberry allergy is an acceptable risk and that strawberry baked goods are kind of obvious-looking and easy to avoid in a way that brownies with walnuts in them aren't.
Language,"This visual information allows the neighborhood council to get my point more efficiently than just the words alone. It helps me express a sort of complicated idea that peanuts and other allergens in the bake sale might constitute too much of a risk to my neighbors and that they shouldn't be allowed. Now, there are other questions like is this a representative data set? But that's a question that can be better answered by our statistics course. For now, think about it this way."
Language,"As a reader, your job is to look at everything that is on the page, not just the text. Then think about what both the data and the words do for your understanding. Data and informational text are two great tastes that go great together. One can support the other and vice versa, you know, like chocolate and peanut butter. Oh, no, sorry, bad example, like chocolate and sunflower butter. You know what I mean. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"""This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why."" Argument does not sneak, it does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories: data, fact, observable reality. There is a place for pure subjective opinion, and it is the realm of the movie and the restaurant review."
Language,"""I did not like this movie because I didn't laugh at its jokes."" ""I did not enjoy the hamburger I got because I found it too dry for my liking."" This is not what we're talking about today. Obviously, argument is rooted in opinion and subjective personal preferences, but those opinions need to be backed up with evidence. Let's compare arguments for and against a tax on soda."
Language,"Now, this writer argues that sugar contributes to obesity, and therefore, people should be prevented from buying soda, which is full of sugar on the grounds that it is bad for them, let's take a look. The soda tax could alter many people's behavior, causing them to stop buying sugary drinks. Some foods are necessities like milk, eggs, and bread. People will buy them even if the prices increase. Sugary drinks aren't necessary."
Language,"If the price goes up, people will buy fewer sugary drinks and they won't be consuming as much sugar, therefore, the obesity rate will go down. Whereas this author counters that people have a right to make what they see as unhealthy decisions. Soda and other sugary drinks have been targeted because they lack nutrition and are basically just liquid sugar. Most people would agree that proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
Language,"However, do legislators have the right or responsibility to regulate people's sugar intake in order to improve their health? I say, no. All right, let's evaluate these claims. For the first argument in favor of the soda tax, how do we know this is true? What evidence does this author give that this tax will alter people's behavior? What evidence does this author give that sugary drinks aren't seen to be as essential as milk? After all, not everyone can or does drink milk."
Language,"In the piece, the evidence that the author gives us is this table, which shows how much sugar is in soda per serving, but it doesn't use evidence to connect sugar consumption to unhealthy outcomes. All this says is, soda has a lot of sugar. I wanna see evidence, I wanna see studies. How do we know this tax would change behavior? Good readers think through the impacts of an argument."
Language,"If this tax went into effect, what would the consequences be? Are there faults in the author's logic? It might stop some people from buying soda, but in an unfair way. Here's how I'm processing this as a reader. If you take a bottle of soda that previously costs, say $2, and the tax makes it $10, that will make it more difficult to purchase. But to a millionaire, the difference between $2 and $10 is basically nothing. Whereas to a poor or middle class person, that $8 difference adds up pretty quickly."
Language,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary."
Language,"So now I'm asking, whose responsibility is it to determine how much sugar is in a drink? Why is sugar so inexpensive to begin with? Do legislators have a responsibility there? Now we know it's not legal to bottle rat poison and sell it as tea, but whose responsibility is that? What isn't this author saying, and how does not saying it serve their argument? They're not saying what the government could or should do, only what it shouldn't do."
Language,"And this is why I want you to be skeptical whenever you read anyone's argument about anything. You need to figure out what the terms of the debate are. What does the argument assume as a given? What's a problem worth fixing? What are the trade offs that the writer thinks are acceptable? So when you encounter an argument in text, look for the claims, and then look to see if those claims are backed up with data-supported reasoning."
Language,"Is the author using evidence and logic? Do they anticipate objections to their arguments and push back on or incorporate those critiques? Above all else, I want you to remain skeptical. Everyone's selling something, even me. It's just the thing I'm trying to sell you is the fundamental idea that you can learn anything. You've got this, Readers. David out.."
Language,"It doesn't contain violence, obscenity or profanity. Or even anything that wouldn't appear in a G-rated movie, but it will contain explicit evidence. Yes, we're talking about citing evidence in literary analysis. When you're talking about a text and making arguments about it, in order to successfully build that argument, you must make inferences and draw conclusions. And those must be built on the back of evidence."
Language,"Both explicit, that is stated in the text, or implicit or based on clues or evidence in the text. So your responsibility is to tie those conclusions or inferences back to explicit or implicit evidence in the text. It can't just be, ""This is a feeling I have."" It has to be, ""My feeling about this is backed up by this specific evidence."" Say you're trying to be make an argument in a book that the captain of this pirate ship, let's just say, I guess, he's a birdman. That's what I drew, he's a birdman."
Language,"He's really unkind to the main character in the beginning of the book, but changes by the end of the book and treats everyone, including the main character with respect and courtesy. So I'm gonna write that my argument is that the captain's behavior changes towards the MC, the main character. I have to back that assertion up with evidence. So how do we find those details? First, you have to seek out parts of the book where the captain and the main character interact."
Language,"Then look closely at the pros and dialogue. What are the details that prove your point? Which are the strongest, most specific details that say, ""Oh, yes, here is where the captain is being mean. Here is where the captain is being respectful."" If you can't find evidence for your assertion, first, try searching in a different part of the book. Or importantly, acknowledge the possibility that you might have a weak argument."
Language,"Maybe it's time to start over and find a new or different argument to make and find support for. Once you've assembled your evidence work it into your analysis. ""Captain Bigsby is dismissive and rude to Eniola when she first joins the crew of the pirate ship Albatross,"" I might say. And then back it up with an explicit example of Captain Bigsby being dismissive and rude with a page number citation like so."
Language,"On page 34 of ""To the Burbling Deep,"" Bigsby says to Eniola, ""You there, what's her name! These portholes need to be scrubbed yesterday. Get to work!."" ""Yes, sir, Captain,"" Eniola said. ""But my name is-"" ""Does it look like I care?"" the captain snarled. But by the end of the story, when Eniola has proven her worth, saved the day, and humbled the captain, he treats her, and everyone around him, with much greater respect and deference."
Language,"On page 225, after Bigsby tends to Eniola's broken leg, he tells her, ""Eniola, that was some mighty fine pirating you did. You showed no fear when you punched that kraken, and more importantly, you showed no fear when you stood up to me. I was wrong, and I have been a jerk, and I am sorry."" Now both of those examples use explicit evidence where Captain Bigsby is being a jerk and then when he is apologizing for being a jerk. There's also implicit evidence too. Bigsby tends to Eniola's broken leg."
Language,"So while he's not saying, ""I will take care of you little buddy,"" with his words, he is saying it with his actions. And in that first example when he demands that Eniola clean the portholes, he's not literally saying, ""I'm impatient,"" But by saying, ""They need to be scrubbed yesterday,"" as an immediately because you already messed up, he's implying that he's impatient. Now there is no such book that I know of about a kraken punching girl pirate. But if we're lucky, my friend Jordan will write one."
Language,"Remember to use strong details to get good evidence. There might be a part of ""To The Burbling Deep"" where Captain Bigsby huffs angrily at Eniola but doesn't say anything, and that's mean or, at least, impolite, but it's not as strong as him yelling at her. So when you find the detail, ask yourself, how does that detail related back to your analysis or your argument."
Language,"Is it repeated? Does that detail or detail similar to it appear elsewhere in the text? And if you see a lot of similar details, how do those details prove the argument that you're trying to make? If you have a sense of what the central idea or ideas of the text is, try to connect those details back to that central idea and then connect that central idea to your own argument. I don't know what ""To the Burbling Deep"" is about 'cause I made it up 20 minutes ago."
Language,"But maybe one theme in it is that it's important to recognize the potential with another people. And that can be both true for Eniola who becomes a hero and punches a giant octopus monster, but it can also be true of Captain Bigsby who occupies kind of antagonistic role and then changes through the story. And so we can build our argument around that idea that character change is possible. Not just for the main character, but for everybody. So that's where I will leave you."
Language,"Remember to choose the pieces of evidence that give you the strongest support for your idea and if the evidence doesn't match your idea, you might need to change the idea itself. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"Understanding the plot of a story is essential to writing about it. You can't write about a story if you can't express what happened in it. So what I want to do today is talk about creating objective summaries of texts. Summaries that are free of opinion, or non biased. If you're summarizing a book, you wanna get across the events of the story. Objectivity is hard and weird and has a very specific purpose. You use it to build the bones of your analysis."
Language,"Once you've got the structure in place, bring opinions back. Here are the facts and now here's what I think about those facts. Let me be clear, opinions are good. Opinions are where analysis lives. The whole field of literary criticism would be awfully boring if nobody ever held opinions but all that criticism rests on a basis of objectively summarized texts. So let's talk about how to do just that, how to objectively summarize a text. Here's what you need to do."
Language,"Step one, read the thing you want to summarize. You can't do one without the other. Step two, ask yourself, what are the important parts of this story? Not the interesting parts, not the cool parts, but the most essential parts of the story. Remember we're trying to be objective here so it's not about including the parts you especially liked. So who are the main characters, where does the story take place, what happens in the plot? Step three, pare it down."
Language,"Look at all those important parts you listed, and cut out everything that isn't absolutely essential. Major characters only, setting, conflict, climax, resolution. Step four, put it in order. Write it all out as sentences in the order the plot happened in. The idea is to be able to summarize a whole story in a handful of sentences, like a single five sentence paragraph. And you're gonna wanna paraphrase here."
Language,"Whatever you need to say, say it in your own words so you can get it across as quickly as possible. Ordinarily, I'd say quoting from the text is an important skill but this is one time you won't use it. All right so, those are the four steps. To demonstrate, I'm gonna take a fiction piece from a Khan Academy exercise and I'll go through that process with you. Step one, let's read it all, read this little story chunk. ""'Wilky!' Captain Martello bellowed below deck."
Language,"""'We need your help!' I climbed the ladder quickly ""and was astonished that I hadn't awakened on my own. ""Usually I could sense a storm brewing ""hours before it arrived. ""Captain Martello noticed my look of surprise. ""'She's coming on quick, this one. Here, grab the rope, ""Help me pull down the sail.' ""Overboard, the waters had changed. ""No longer were they an inviting green hue, ""they were dark, foreboding."
Language,"""The moon above tried to peek through the angry sky ""but the clouds kept hijacking her hopeful glow. ""Suddenly, a giant slow rolling wave ""forced my side of the vessel to dip into the water. ""I tried to hang on but the lurching wave was tugging at me. ""Captain Martello grabbed my leg ""and managed to yank me onto Adelina's salt sprayed deck. ""'You're safe,' he said firmly, 'for now.'"" Okay step two, what are the important parts of the story? Okay so Wilky comes on deck when Captain Martello asks him to."
Language,"They're on a boat. And note here that I'm just sort of scribbling down notes, these aren't even sentences. There's a storm coming that Wilky didn't predict. The captain tells Wilky to help him strike the sail. The water is a scary color, a wave nearly washes Wilky overboard but the captain saves him. Oh and the ship is called the Adelina. I think that's a neat name for a ship. All right step three, pare it down. So the fact that I think that Adelina is a neat name for a ship is opinion and not relevant."
Language,"It's also not super relevant that Wilky didn't predict the storm. Or that the water is a spooky color. So do we have all the important details in here? The name of the ship, check. The name of Wilky and Captain Martello, the fact that there is a storm. So part of this is relevant but not the prediction part and Wilky nearly being tossed overboard but saved by the captain. So step four, let's take all of that, put it in order. Start afresh, full sentences, okay."
Language,"Captain Martello calls Wilky up to the deck of the Adelina to help him prepare the ship for a sudden storm. Wilky is nearly washed overboard by a big wave but Martello saves them. That's our strategy, you see? Boil down the story to its essentials, strip away unnecessary detail and rephrase events in your own words in the order that they happened in. Once you've got that squared away, you're ready to back up that great big dump truck full of opinions. All right bring her in."
Language,"(truck backing up beeping) Let them have it, fellows. (crashing) You love to see it. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Tone communicates how an author feels about the topic they're writing about, this can come across in a number of different ways, it can reflect their enthusiasm or skepticism, it can also communicate formality or informality, an academic paper or a speech before the UN, for example are very different things from a toast at a wedding or a thank you card for a birthday gift and this kind of difference in tone is something that sociologists and linguists call register."
Language,"Social conventions and customs call for different registers in different circumstances, just as it would be inappropriate in most situations to wear a tuxedo at the beach, so too would it be incongruous to use extremely formal language in an informal setting? (melodic orchestral music) (clearing throat) Dear honored sir, it was the privilege of my very life to have you attend my 14th birthday party. I am grateful beyond words for your most generous gift, a check for $36 American."
Language,"Your humble and obedient servant, David. In fact using extremely formal language and high-minded gratitude for something as relatively small as a birthday gift might even come across as sarcastic or insulting. But this is sort of an extreme example, let's pull back and discuss how an understanding of tone can aid you in making sense of informational texts."
Language,"One great way to do that is to analyze word choice, we can look at a writer's language and determine their attitude towards the subject based on the words they've chosen to describe it. Oceans of ink have been spilled over comparisons between a Chicago style hotdog and a New York style hotdog. The first with its garden's worth of toppings, but a holier than now prohibition of ketchup, the latter with its sauerkraut, mustard and dubious dirty water cooking style."
Language,"But scant attention, a droplet of ink before the ocean has been paid to the half-smoke, the unsung but mighty regional sausage of Washington DC. Now how does the author think about the subject? Well, we know that they think that not enough writing has been done about DC's regional sausage, the half-smoke, but how do they feel about it? How do the words they use express their feelings? Let's break it down bit by bit."
Language,"So right out of the gate, we have oceans of ink, this is a deliberate piece of overstatement, there are no literal oceans made of ink, but it's being set up in opposition to the droplet of ink used to describe half-smokes later in the paragraph."
Language,"Half-smokes are described as unsung, but mighty, which suggests that they haven't been given their due, there hasn't been enough praise for half-smokes and that therefore the amount of attention given to Chicago and New York hotdogs is unfair or even disproportionate. I think we can also determine from word choice, that the author thinks a Chicago hot dog is a little ridiculous and that a New York hot dog is a little gross."
Language,"How do we know this? Chicagoans generally don't like ketchup on their hotdogs and the way the author phrases this is by saying, that they have a holier than thou prohibition on ketchup, which is to say they get all haughty and upset about it, which is weird because it's ketchup, listen, I'm a Chicagoan by birth, I used to feel this way and I'm not even sure why."
Language,"Similarly the word dubious in the description of the New York hotdog, meaning doubtful suggests that the dirty water cooking method is kind of nasty sounding, why would the author do this? Is it to say these are terrible hot dogs and nobody should eat them? No, I don't think so, The author is trying to make room for the half-smoke in the national sausage conversation and to do that, they're first trying to dismantle the importance of New York and Chicago style by making fun of them."
Language,"These are tactical choices, not to be confused with authorial voice, which is a different concept entirely an author's voice is their style, it's much more consistent across topics, whereas a tone is specific to a topic. So I might have an authorial voice, that uses a lot of goofy wordplay, but I use a sympathetic tone to talk about bears and a hostile tone to talk about, I don't know, whales, yeah, boo whales, I said it. I do not actually hate whales, I love whales."
Language,"But my point is this, use your knowledge of words, of the connotation and implications of the language, that an author might use to unlock your understanding of their tone, because if you can do that, my friend, you can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"Who knows what, when, and what does that tell us? A writer can control which characters have access to information, and they can control what access you, the reader, or the viewer, have to information to. The information you have and the information the characters have help develop our perspectives. Within a story, conflict between characters can come from a difference in perspective."
Language,"In ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" the character of Prince Zuko is consumed by his desire to capture the avatar, as he feels that this will end his exile and restore him to a place of prominence at his father's side. His uncle Iroh, however, understands based on many years of hard experience, that Zuko's father is a cruel man who never intended to take his son back. Iroh only wants to keep his nephew safe. This difference in perspective generates a lot of conflict between the two of them."
Language,"The show slowly reveals Iroh's perspective over time. Whereas we, as viewers, know what Zuko wants and why almost immediately. In fiction, that kind of information asymmetry between the storyteller, the characters, and the audience, leads to something called dramatic irony. You're watching a play, or a TV show, or reading a book, and you, the audience, the reader, knows something that the characters don't."
Language,"This is possible because especially in a visual medium, the audience has a different point of view than the characters do. We can see things they don't see. This difference in point of view is what allows tension, suspense, and jokes. Remember, irony is just the difference between expectation and result. It can be leveraged to achieve anything that uses the mechanism of surprise. I don't wanna belabor how jokes work. Literally nothing is more boring or unfunny than explaining jokes."
Language,"So, let's use suspense as our example. Imagine a very low stakes villain, The Cheeseler, who goes around pranking people by balancing buckets of cottage cheese on doorframes. You go through the door, blam, you get cheesed. I want you to imagine a scene in which we see The Cheeseler booby trap the protagonist's door with a bucket of cottage cheese. Nobody else in the story is around to witness this. After all, The Cheeseler stands alone. And now, we see our hero in Tamika."
Language,"She's walking down the hall with such confidence, blindly unaware of the cheesy threat that awaits her when she opens that door. We come back to the cheese. It's still there, oh no, oh no Tamika. Do you see what I'm doing here? Do you see how this generates suspense? You, the viewer, know something the character doesn't know. The difference between her point of view and your point of view generates tension. This is something that writers do on purpose."
Language,"This tension, this dramatic irony, draws us in because it's very satisfying to see it resolved. We know that there's that possibility of Tamika getting splatted with cottage cheese, but what if Tamika, at the last moment, kicks open the door? The cheese bucket drops, and Tamika catches it neatly. Whoo, thank goodness. She saw that the door was slightly ajar and put it together. The tension is resolved as the gap closes between what Tamika knows and what we know."
Language,"When characters resolve interpersonal differences, it's through an alignment of their points of view. That's what brings us to resolution. The difference between two points of view can be reconciled, and that too, is a way of relieving story tension. Now, I'd like to counsel you against making blanket statements about specific genres of work, like sure, a first person story could limit the flow of information because we're perceiving a story through the senses of the point of view character."
Language,"But, in your analysis of that story, be sure to get specific. How does that specific character in that particular situation see events? Why does the author show us, the readers, information that character doesn't get to see? Asking yourself questions about those differences in perspective between the narration and characters, between two or more characters, between the text and the reader, will make it easy for you to analyze the impact of those decisions that the author made."
Language,"And now, I'm going to go walk my dog. I will see you all next time. You can learn anything, David out. All right. (humming) (metal clanking) Oh, curse you Cheeseler!."
Language,"I don't literally mean that I've got a bear. That would be extremely sweet. Love a bear, love bear's whole thing with the snacking and the sleeping and the eating of fish, but no. A bear of is a figurative expression that means something difficult. So a bear of a lesson is a difficult lesson and that's what we're talking about today. Not bears, sorry, but non-literal uses of language, which we call figurative language or figures of speech. Figurative language says one thing but means another."
Language,"I could say that my colleague Allison is an eagle-eyed editor and when I say that I don't mean that she literally has an eagle's eyes in her head. That would be a terrifying achievement of medical science. No, I'm saying that she is sharp and attentive in the same way that an eagle is. So I'm saying something that is not literally true in order to express something that is true, that Allison is good at editing. Would you call that a lie? I'm not sure I would."
Language,"It's just a non-literal way of expressing myself. So, having gotten the question of whether or not I'm a dirty rotten liar out of the way, let's talk about some different varieties of figurative language. First, the simile. A simile is a comparison between two things that uses like or as. If I were really hungry, I could say that my stomach was gurgling like a tar pit or that I was as hungry as a ravenous wolf, and again, neither of these things are literally true."
Language,"If my stomach were making actual tar pit noises, I would probably need to go to a hospital. But what do those examples tell you about the way that I, the speaker, think about my hunger? Animals and people get stuck in tar pits, they're gloppy, they pull things into them, they slow things down. Sorry T-Rex. Therefore, I'm saying that my hunger is slowing me down. Or, if I'm comparing myself to a wolf, you can imagine me looking lean and desperate, saliva dripping from my jaws at the mere thought of food."
Language,"I could really go for a cheese danish come to think of it. So that's simile. The second figure of speech I wanna talk about today is the metaphor. And what's a metaphor? Cows and sheep! Sorry, I couldn't help it. No, a metaphor is not a meadow for. Metaphors are another way of comparing two things, but this time there's no like or as. We're walking this language tightrope without a net now."
Language,"You aren't signaling with like or as that you're making a figurative comparison, so you have to use context to communicate clearly. At the beginning of this video I said this was going to be a bear of a lesson. That's a metaphor. There's a Linda Ronstadt country song from the 70s, called ""Love is a Rose,"" which is all about how to take care of a relationship through the metaphor of tending a flower with thorns on it."
Language,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person."
Language,"To say that differently, it's ascribing human characteristics to non-living things. The wind howled through the mountains. The car grumbled as I threw it into gear. The storm raged. These are things that people do, but I'm applying that language to inanimate things, like wind and cars and storms in order to express the way these things are behaving. The car is not literally grumbling, ""Aw man, I can't believe David has to drive me today."" It's making noises that I am choosing to identify as unhappy."
Language,"The greatest kind of figurative language in the entire universe is hyperbole. By exaggerating, I'm expressing emphasis and importance. This summer, I'm going to read a million books and eat a literal actual ton of hot dogs. This is not true. In fact, this is impossible. That is too many hot dogs, those are too many books, each of which are sentences I never expected to say, but I'm trying to express my enthusiasm for both books and encased meats, and I'm doing that by being, you know, extra."
Language,"The final kind of expressive language I wanna talk about today isn't exactly figurative language, it's the language of allusions and references. Where you make comparisons to characters or events from literature, or movies, or culture. Also note that it's allusion with an A, as opposed to illusion with an I. An illusion with an I is like a magic trick. Here are some examples of allusions. Oh, you'd have to be Superman to lift that fallen tree. Or, you have a Gollum-like obsession with that stuffed animal."
Language,"Now these comparisons only work if the person you're talking to understands the reference. Superman has super strength, Gollum, from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" can't stop talking about how much he loves this one object, the ring. If you don't know the reference, then it's all just noise. One tip is to read up on mythology. You'd be surprised how many times ancient gods, like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo come up as you read. So that's what we're working with here. Simile, love is like a rose."
Language,"Metaphor, love is a rose. Personification, my car grumbled. Hyperbole, my mom grounded me for eight trillion years. And allusion, I feel mightier than Hercules. That's figurative language folks. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"That's right, I'm talking about connotation. The way the word feels, the context around it. Imagine a rock in a stream. Well, connotation is the way that culture flows around the word. This is distinct from denotation, which is more like the dictionary definition of a word. Companion and buddy both have similar denotations. They both mean friend, but companion is a much more formal sounding word than buddy. Which originated as a piece of slang from the 19th century."
Language,"So even though their denotation or their literal definition is the same, they feel different. The connotation of companion is formal while the connotation of buddy is friendly and casual. Good readers pay close attention to the words the author chose to use. They picked those words for a reason. How do those words make you feel? What is the author trying to imply? How do the words propel the overall tone or theme of the text? So connotation is about word choice, sure. But it's also abut setting a tone."
Language,"One way you set tone is by expressing an opinion. So some words may have a similar denotation but very different connotations. For example, let's say I was describing someone whose behavior was nice, like they were behaving in a kindly way. The way I described that person can express how I, as a writer, feel about that behavior. If I trust the person, I could describe them as sweet as sugar."
Language,"""Oh, Jake's such a sweet guy."" ""Love that Jakey boy!"" But if I didn't trust that person, like if I thought that this hypothetical Jake's show of kindness was fake, I could say that he was cloying or syrupy. And those words also means sweet, but they have a connotation of too much. Cloying means too sweet. So you can sort these words in the positive and negative connotations. Sweet is positive, cloying is negative. Some words will have neutral or uncertain connotations and that's okay, too."
Language,"But it doesn't just have to be straightforwardly positive, negative or neutral either. You can just use connotation for the sake of poetic license or building a motif. Let's say I was writing a story about someone who started a plant nursery, and I wanted to use words that described growth. But I also wanted to build in connotations about nature or plants throughout the piece. And in this example I'm a news paper reporter and I'm doing a profile of someone in my town, let's call her Genevieve."
Language,"Genevieve Jenkins, proprietor of Jenkins Orchard Supply. She's ready for the outdoors, she's got her big sun hat, she's got her hoop earrings, she's got her little name tag, she's got a little plant necklace. She seems like a nice person. Okay, I could say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply was a great ""success in its new location."" But if I wanted to put in a little bit of that nature note, I'd say, ""Jenkins Orchard Supply flourished in its new location."" Because flourished is related to the word flower."
Language,"To flourish is to grow. Grow and flourish have a similar denotation, but they have different connotations. Grow can refer to plants, but it can refer to anything that increases in size. A little sponge toy can grow when you place it in the cup of water, but it won't flourish. Flourishing has a connotation of flowering and success. Continuing this idea, I could talk about how Ms. Jenkins decided to settle on the location of her plant nursery."
Language,"And rather than say that she settled into the neighborhood, I could say instead that she put down roots there. Now, these are kind of extreme examples. These nature words and expressions are kinda getting close to jokes or puns, but I'm trying to be extra obvious here about the plant thing so that you can learn to detect more subtle connotations in the future. And connotation can be so personal, too."
Language,"There may be words that have important emotional resonance for one person that are basically meaningless to anybody else. When I was a kid, I cycled through pretty much every much team sport: Baseball, soccer, basketball. I wasn't good at any of them, but I was especially terrible at basketball and I remember very particularly the way that coaches would call out, ""Good hustle, David, good hustle!"" Because that was the only thing that I could do especially well."
Language,"I couldn't dribble, I definitely couldn't shoot. And my passing game was not great. So even now, I associate the phrase, ""Good hustle,"" with you're not especially good at basketball. Which is a shame because I'm tall now. My experience is specific to me, it's not universal. It's very unlikely that you share that same connotation with the word hustle. A fun game to play is to come up with a word and then list all the synonyms for that word you can imagine, and then sort them by connotation."
Language,"If you are like me, the kind of person who enjoys sorting jelly beans by color, you will get a similar amount of satisfaction from that exercise. So look out for connotations as you read, as you write. Words carry their dictionary meanings, but they also carry other cultural meanings as well. And that's connotation. You can learn anything, David out.."
Language,"It is a giant robot made up of five smaller robots, each one piloted by a person. Five friends, each with control over a different part of the robot's body. You're up in the head, I'm operating the right leg, our buddy's operating the left, and so on. In order to walk or pick up objects or fight space monsters the size of battleships, all the disparate of the robot have to function together. Well, texts work much the same way."
Language,"Each portion of the text, from the section level down to more granular divisions like individual paragraphs or sentences, is trying to serve the broader point of the text. When we look at Voltron's foot in motion, we analyze what the foot is doing in the service of Voltron as a whole."
Language,"If Voltron's foot kicks a ball, we have to zoom out to ask, is Voltron playing soccer? This is a pretty abstract idea without any text examples, so let's stop talking about space robots and start talking about the Armor of 10th-century Japanese horse archers. All right, so this whole passage is about the armor worn by mounted archer samurai of 10th-century Japan, o-yoroi, and how it's constructed. So this is a piece of o-yoroi armor. This is the whole assemblage."
Language,"And that's how the piece is divided, right? We've got the sections here for each component. The cuirass, the o-sode or shoulder guards, the kusazuri, or armored skirt, and the kabuto, the helmet. And each one of these elements of the armor connects back to the whole point of the piece, which is describing how the armor does two things. One, it protects the wearer, and two, allows them to ride horses and fire arrows. Now we see this in the introductory paragraph."
Language,"Their armor, called o-yoroi, was designed specifically to withstand the demands of mounted archer warfare. So let's dig into this first section about the cuirass, the breastplate and backplate armor. I'll read the first paragraph. ""A cuirass is usually a piece of armor ""that consists of a breastplate and a backplate ""that are attached together. ""The cuirass for the o-yoroi was a bit different ""than a typical cuirass, ""as it was designed to be more effective for an archer."
Language,"""The o-yoroi cuirass had three sections instead of two. ""A section to protect the back, ""a section to protect the chest, ""and a section to protect the left side body. ""The right side was left open ""so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow."" So this paragraph is describing what a cuirass is and how it functions as armor, but then it goes into detailing how an o-yoroi cuirass is different because it's for someone holding a bow, right? It has three sections instead of two."
Language,"The right side was left open so the warrior could best utilize his bow and arrow. This information down to the sentence level all serves the same purpose. It serves to answer the question, how was o-yoroi armor specifically designed to meet the needs of a mounted archer? Not every sentence or every paragraph will address every part of that main question. Note that the cuirass section doesn't cover anything about how the archers are on horseback."
Language,"To answer that question, we need to go down to the third section, the kusazuri, the battle skirt. I'm not gonna read the whole paragraph. Let's just zoom in on this one sentence. ""The kusazuri were designed so that when the warrior ""was sitting in his horse's saddle, ""they fit nicely over the saddle in a skirtlike fashion ""to protect his lower body and upper legs."" This particular sentence tells us how this part of the armor protects the samurai's legs while they're on horseback."
Language,The paragraph and section it's part of detail the whole construction of that part of the armor and how it relates to the other pieces. And all of those paragraphs together form one text that explained the thing it set out to explain. What is o-yoroi and how does it work for 10th-century horse archer samurai? Each section or paragraph is like a leg or an arm of Voltron. Each sentence is a muscle or a finger or a robo-toe.
Language,"Together, moving as one, they tell a story or make an argument, which I guess is like Voltron winning a fight, maybe. I feel like I've carried this metaphor as far as it'll go. The point is, if you're having trouble making sense of an informational text, think of it as a giant battle robot. What is each of component part of the text trying to accomplish? And when you put all those parts together, what are they trying to do? Well, my work here is done. You can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"But I think it is unwise to think of it as a one-way conversation. The best arguments do not plunge forward heedlessly. They do not steamroll opposition. Rather, they seek out opposing arguments and incorporate them. Good readers pay attention to how authors acknowledge opposing viewpoints in an argument. Doing this makes it easier to decide how well thought out an argument is and determine whether the author is knowledgeable and thoughtful in their position."
Language,"Now, I do not practice the martial art of Wing Chun. But that style of self-defense is famous for techniques that block and strike at the same time. Your opponent's fist comes in, you redirect it away from your body, and in that same motion continue your momentum into its own immediate counterstrike. Acknowledging the existence of opposing viewpoints has two main applications, which are pretty different."
Language,"First, maybe you're not on any side of the argument and you wish to straightforwardly describe the conflict, like a journalist reporting on a lawsuit. It's a journalist's responsibility to truthfully portray the full scope of information on a topic, bringing every piece of relevant and plausible information to bear. The author provides equal time to the disputants and tries not to provide their own opinion here. That could look like this. Ms. Adeyemi contended that Mr."
Language,"Dupont stole the cookies from her cookie jar, and that furthermore, she had baked those cookies in the first place, thus strengthening her claim to the said cookies. Of the 24 cookies baked by Ms. Adeyemi, she alleges that 10 of them were taken by Mr. Dupont. Mr. Dupont, however, contended that as he was the person who made the cookie jar for Ms. Adeyemi in the ceramics class he took, he is entitled to the occasional cookie."
Language,"He does not dispute the 10-cookie figure, adding only that they were ""delicious."" Judge Huang, upon reviewing testimony from both parties, sided with Ms. Adeyemi, saying that you are not entitled to a cookie just for being a good friend one time, and that next time, Mr. Dupont should ask for permission. Now, looking at that situation, my personal opinion is that it is inappropriate to steal your friend's cookies. An opinion that any right-thinking person should share."
Language,"But injecting opinion may not be appropriate in all cases. So okay, that's the first case. Reporting on multiple sides of a dispute without getting involved yourself. Now, the second reason, the second application for including opposing viewpoints in an argumentative piece of writing is that Wing Chun thing, the block as you strike technique."
Language,"It makes your argument stronger if you anticipate possible objections to it, address them, and strike them down all the while still making your argument in the first place. Let's take this example from the website. This piece is about the lost colony at Roanoke. A bunch of English settlers disappeared under uncertain circumstances for reasons still unknown. And the author's trying to make the case that although theories for the disappearance exist, the truth is still beyond our grasp."
Language,"So in order to make that case, they address several different theories that attempt to explain the disappearance. Many people have tried to solve the mystery of the lost colony. Historians and archeologists have searched for answers for hundreds of years. Some possible solutions are: A, Native people killed the colonists on Roanoke Island. B, the colonists were all killed on Roanoke Island by disease. C, their town was washed away by a hurricane, and the people drowned."
Language,"Or D, they all left Roanoke Island and went to live in some other place. Now, watch what the author does as they systematically go through each theory and address it. I've only excepted the first two, so let's look at those first two. A, when John White got back to Roanoke Island in 1590 he did not find any bones or bodies or any signs of fighting. Bones last a long time. If Native people had killed the colonists, there would probably have been some remains or other signs of violence."
Language,"We can guess that the colonists were not killed on Roanoke Island. B, when the English first came to Virginia, they're using a 16th-century spelling, they brought diseases with them, such as flu and smallpox, that were new to the Native communities. They had no immunity against them and many died very quickly. Letters written by the colonists tell us that the English remained healthy. And remember, no bones or bodies or graves were found. We can guess that the colonists did not all die of disease."
Language,"So the author's saying that these events are unlikely, taking the theories seriously, and then thinking them through to their conclusions. But demonstrating why they don't seem very likely explanations. Why do they think it's unlikely that Native people killed those colonists? There aren't any remains or signs of combat. Why does it seem unlikely that they died of diseases? There are no graves or remains. The thesis is, nobody knows why."
Language,"Here are two counters to it basically saying here's why, and the author says here's why these are unlikely to be true which weakens those counterarguments and strengthens the original. Block, strike. My overall point is this. Don't ignore the potential counters to your argument. Incorporate them, analyze them, and redirect their energy into your own position. And when you read, notice if the author is acknowledging counters or ignoring them. If they ignore them, you should be suspicious."
Language,"Why are they ignoring them? If you can answer that, then you can learn anything. David out.."
Language,"How do we know that though? How did J. R. R. Tolkien, as an author, develop that theme in the text? How can we go deeper, beyond that headline of the Ring equals the dangers of absolute power? Good readers can look at a whole text from beginning to end and identify where the author purposefully chose words, included details, or directed action that develops or reveals the overall theme."
Language,"It's not just that characters say, ""Oh, no, the Ring's super-dangerous."" In fact, I believe in ""The Fellowship of the Ring, Gandalf says, ""No, with that power, ""I should have power too great and terrible. ""And over me, the Ring could gain a power ""still greater and more deadly. ""Do not tempt me!"" The characters say that, they do, but it's also about how they behave around the thing."
Language,"It's how the plot is shaped around this object and how a group of people come together to identify this Ring as a dangerous, magical artifact that needs to be destroyed for the good of the world. It's not just dialogue. It's also descriptions by the author and actions taken by the characters."
Language,"So let's go through some of the ways that an author can develop theme within a story, with the important caveat that you won't always be able to detect a theme in a text until you're already finished reading it for the first time. This, to me, is one of the great pleasures of rereading. You've already worked hard to get an understanding of the text, so now you can go back and pick up all the stuff you might not have noticed the first time."
Language,"So one way to develop theme is through the repeated use of a symbol or an object. The Ring in ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great example because characters are always talking about it. But it could really be anything, a design, an object, an animal. Imagine a story about a child who wants to grow up to be an engineer that develops airplanes. And throughout this story, birds keep showing up, birds on the protagonist's windowsill, her favorite teacher's bird earrings, maybe she has a best friend named Robin."

Language,"And from that, we can see the idea of flight is a theme in this story, and all of these bird-related things go back to this character's desire to take flight. Changes in setting are a fine way to develop themes. How is a location portrayed? How does it match with the way characters feel or behave when they appear in these locations? Imagine a character who desperately wants to be alone. So at a tense portion in the story, she flees to a distant mountaintop."
Language,"When she gets there, what's the weather like? Is it cold, snowy, and forbidding on the mountain? Is it an active volcano, bubbling with lava? Is it clear, peaceful, full of snowdrops and mountain goats? What would an author be trying to say with those decisions? How should we, the reader, feel about that character's solitude? If it's snowy and forbidding, is it a symbol of the character's coldness, of their hardening up? Does the volcano reflect the character's explosive potential? Or does the beauty of the lonely mountaintop mean this was the right decision for the character to take? Dialogue that repeatedly references a similar idea can be a way to develop theme."
Language,"When characters mention something a lot, it's probably because the author is thinking about it and maybe wanted to build it intentionally into the story. Imagine a teenager in Ancient Rome who's preoccupied with honor and his family name and how he's worried he won't live up to the achievements of his ancestors. If that's something that he's insecure about, he might think about it often or talk about the concept of honor or the social standing of his family."
Language,"You can also see this presented as explicit lessons by a sage character, usually older and wise. Think of Moana's grandmother or of Yoda. They'll say something explicit like, ""Go do the thing your heart wants, Moana,"" or, ""Trust that the energy of the universe ""will make you a really good space wizard, Luke."" I'm paraphrasing here. Or think of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" saying, ""There's no place like home."" She says it again and again. The words are so powerful that they're used as a magic spell."
Language,"And words so powerful that they become magic is really just another way to say theme. It doesn't need to be said aloud to be thematic. Some of the most powerful moments in storytelling come from action, not just dialogue. Momentous character decisions, like Maui giving up his powers to save Moana or Harry Potter's climactic battle with Voldemort, are chock-full of themes, self-sacrifice, the power of love, the importance of honesty. Some of these themes can be expressed without speaking a single word."
Language,"And I should be clear. Sometimes you need to finish the story before you can look back on it and understand how parts of it contribute to the theme. You might need to get some distance before you can see how all of the pieces fit together. If something really sticks with me, sometimes I like to go back and reread parts of a book once I've gotten a sense of its theme, to see how the author has threaded theme through the text."
Language,"Now, if you look very closely at the videos I make here at Khan Academy, if you really squint your eyes and listen carefully, you'll notice that all of them share the same theme, which is you can learn anything. David out.."
