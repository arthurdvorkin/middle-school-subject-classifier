Health,"your heart sits: between two lungs. And I'm saying left and right from the perspective of the the person who owns this heart. So this is their left and right, which is the opposite of us if we're looking at it. The heart is actually sitting between the two lungs within this protective casing that the ribs are basically there to keep all these important organs safe. And then below them, so if you draw this here. Or if I draw it, you can see now that below all this stuff is a really really important muscle."
Health,"So this muscle people don't talk about this muscle, or this is not the kind of muscle that you usually see people working on at the gym, but this muscle is called the diaphragm. So your diaphragm muscle and your ribs are enclosing a space, right? The diaphragm becomes the floor, and the ribs are kind of the ceiling and the walls of this space. And if you look at the contents of this space, you'd have your lung and you'd have your heart. So, this entire space then is called your thorax."
Health,"So what exactly does the heart do? Let's actually make a little bit of space now, and bring up a zoomed in version of the heart. Let me start by orienting you to the heart. This is our right lung and on the other side we have our left lung. And all this would be inside of the rib cage, but I'm not going to draw that now, because that would make it harder to see the heart itself. So to think about exactly what the heart does, I think one, kind of neat way to do it is to actually imagine that you're a cell."
Health,"So put yourself in the perspective of a cell, and let's say you're a cell hanging out over here. This is you. And you can think about any part of the body that you could be. Let's say a little toe cell. So let's say you're a toe cell and your job, of course, is to live and be happy,and you've got near by, a little blood vessel. And in fact, every cell in our body has a little blood vessel that's near by. And this toe cell is just trying to make a living."
Health,"And toe cells need certain things, right? They need, for example, let's say oxygen. I'll write it in white so it's very clear. They need oxygen and they need nutrients, right? So cells need certain things to live and be happy. And on the flip-side, they also make waste. They're in a sense just like us, they make waste. And that waste could be all sorts of things, and one that kind of jumps to mind is carbon dioxide (CO2). So carbon dioxide is waste for this cell."
Health,"So it's making some waste and for the moment let's imagine that there's no blood flow. So, even though there's a blood vessel near by, really, no flow is happening, so I'll just write ""no flow"". So as the little cell makes waste. That waste, let's draw a little ball right here, it's going to start accumulating, you're going to start collecting more and more of it since the blood is not really flowing. And it might kind of end up getting all the way around our toe cell."
Health,"So our toe cell is getting swamped, literally getting kind of covered by its own waste. And on the flip-side, is it getting oxygen or nutrients? No. It's not getting either of these things. So, before very long, I would say within minutes, our toe cell is thinking, ""Well this is not a very happy way to live!"" this is actually really very sad, this is awful. And if this continues the toe cell would die."
Health,"So, what a toe cell needs, and what every cell needs, and that could be a finger cell or a skin cell, or really any cell that's living, needs flow. Right? It needs this blood to be flowing nicely and smoothly. And if there is flow then you get a very different picture, right? If there's flow then all the sudden all the waste product is actually now lifted and taken away. It's flowing away, and it's a little bit like having someone come by and pick up the trash, then you don't have trash all over the house."
Health,"So then you have nice flow, and in return, oxygen and nutrients are delivered. So this stuff gets delivered as well. So, all of the sudden the cell is going to be very, very happy, and is going to be living just fine. So, really if you want all of the cells in your body to be living just fine like this cell here, you really want good flow throughout the body. And so this is really point number one. Is that you really need, somehow, to have blood flow moving and pushing blood constantly through the body."
Health,"So, to do this for billions and billions of cells you would need a pretty powerful pump, right? Something that's going to be able to pull in all the blood from the body, and then push it back out. And that's what the heart is. I mean at its core, that's exactly what the heart is doing. It's an amazing pump, pushing blood, so that you have good blood flow. And so I'm going to write that on the side as kind of job number one. These are the jobs of the heart. So jobs, and number one, would be blood flow."
Health,"And I'll write systemic flow. Systemic flow. And all that systemic means is that I'm refering to the entire body. So systemic when I say that word, I just mean the entire body. All the cells in the body. Now, exactly how that happens actually you can see on this picture. So, here you have a giant vein, this is a vein, and you have an artery. This is an artery. And blood is actually going through the artery, that way."
Health,"And it's actually coming into two veins, the one at the top, this is called the superior, superior just kind of means at the top. Superior vena cava. That's the name of the vein. And at the bottom here, you can't see it because it's on the other side of the heart, but there's another vein called the inferior vena cava. And these two veins, this is also a vein, these two veins are actually dragging blood in from all over the body, into the heart."
Health,"And then, when the heart is ready to pump it back out, it goes into this artery, and the name of it is the aorta. So if you've heard of the aorta, this is the artery that people are talking about. So this is how blood comes and gets pumped around. But this isn't actually the only job of the heart. The job, the second job of the heart, is actually also in this picture, and it's called pulmonary flow. Pulmonary flow. So, what does that mean? Well, we know that cells are expecting oxygen, right? We know this."
Health,"And that they have a lot of carbon dioxide waste. Well, it's good to move things around. It's good to move blood around. But if you actually never got rid of that carbon dioxide or brought in new oxygen, then a cell is not going to be very happy either. I mean, you can have blood flow, but at some point it's also going to want some oxygen. And it's going to want to get rid of that carbon dioxide. So, that's where the lungs come in."
Health,"So what happens is that the heart, before sending blood out the aorta, before just dishing it out back into the body, it actually sends the blood over to the lungs. And it goes over to the left lung, and over to the right lung. And the blood comes back from the right lung and the left lung, and gets pushed back into the heart, and then gets squeezed through the aorta. So there's this actual extra little step here, where blood is going to and from the lungs, and that's the pulmonary flow."
Health,"So the final thing you'll notice, if you look at this picture it's hard not to notice, is that there are these, kind of wriggly looking little blood vessels all over the heart. And what are these exactly? I mean, you've got red ones, and blue ones, and the blue ones are the veins, and the red ones are the arteries but are they part of the systemic flow, or pulmonary flow, or something else? Well, these vessels, all of them, together are called coronary vessels."
Health,"And so specifically you might hear about a coronary artery, or a coronary vein, but together you can call them coronary blood vessels. I'll add the word blood here. So these coronary blood vessels are actually serving the heart muscle itself. I mean remember, the heart is made up of thousands and thousands, actually tens of thousands of cells and those cells, just like our toe cell that we drew, they also need oxygen, nutrients, and have waste."
Health,"So, those cells are going to need blood vessels supplying them as well. So, that's what the coronary blood vessels are. They're literally the blood vessels that go to and serve the heart. So these are the ones that serve the heart. Now, if they're serving the heart muscles and the heart cells, then, think about it, would they fit under the systemic flow, or pulmonary flow? Well if the main job is to serve the needs of cells, then the coronary vessels fall under the systemic flow.."
Health,"And you can see the vessels coming into it and out of it. But the heart, at its core, is a pump. And this pump is why we call it the hardest working organ in our body. Because it starts pumping blood from the point where you're a little fetus, maybe about eight weeks old, all the way until the point where you die. And so this organ, I think, would be really cool to look at in a little bit more detail. But it's hard to do that looking just at the outside."
Health,"So what I did is I actually drew what it might look like on the inside. So let me actually just show you that now. And we'll follow the path of blood through the heart using this diagram. Let me start with a little picture in the corner. So let's say we have a person here. And this is their face, and this is their neck. I'm going to draw their arms. And they have, in the middle of their chest, their heart."
Health,"And so the whole goal is to make sure that blood from all parts of their body, including their legs, can make its way back to the heart, first of all, and then get pumped back out to the body. So blood is going to come up from this arm, let's say, and dump into there. And the same on this side. And it's going to come from their head. And all three sources, the two arms and the head, are going to come together into one big vein. And that's going to be dumping into the top of the heart."
Health,"And then separately, you've got veins from the legs meeting up with veins from the belly, coming into another opening into the heart. So that's how the blood gets back to the heart. And any time I mention the word vein, I just want you to make sure you think of blood going towards the heart. Now if blood is going towards the heart, then after the blood is pumped by the heart, it's going to have to go out to the heart. It's going to have to go away from the heart. So that's the aorta."
Health,"And the aorta actually has a little arch, like that. We call it the aortic arch. And it sends off one vessel to the arm, one vessel up this way, a vessel over this way. And then this arch kind of goes down, down, down and splits like that. So this is kind of a simplified version of it. But you can see how there are definitely some parallels between how the veins and the arteries are set up. And arteries, anytime I mention the word artery, I want you to think of blood going away from the heart."
Health,"And an easy way to remember that is that they both start with the letter A. So going to our big diagram now. We can see that blood coming in this way and blood coming in this way is ending up at the same spot. It's going to end up at the-- actually, maybe I'll draw it here-- is ending up at the right atrium. That's just the name of the chamber that the blood ends up in. And it came into the right atrium from a giant vessel up top called the superior vena cava."
Health,"And this is a vein, of course, because it's bringing blood towards the heart. And down here, the inferior vena cava. So these are the two directions that blood is going to be flowing. And once blood is in the right atrium, it's going to head down into the right ventricle. So this is the right ventricle, down here. This is the second chamber of the heart. And it gets there by passing through a valve."
Health,"And this valve, and all valves in the heart, are basically there to keep blood moving in the right direction. So it doesn't go in the backwards direction. So this valve is called the tricuspid valve. And it's called that because it's basically got three little flaps. That's why they call it tri. And I know you can only see two in my drawing, and that's just because my drawing is not perfect. And it's hard to show a flap coming out at you, but you can imagine it. So blood goes into the right ventricle."
Health,"And where does it go next? Well after that, it's going to go this way. It's going to go into this vessel, and it's going to split. But before it goes there, it has to pass through another valve. So this is a valve, right here, called the pulmonary valve. And it gives you a clue as to where things are going to go next. Right? Because the word pulmonary means lungs. And so, if this is my lung, on this side, this is my left lung. And this is my right lung, on this side."
Health,"Then these vessels-- and I'll let you try to guess what they would be called-- these vessels. This would be my-- I want to make sure I get my right and left straight. This is my left pulmonary artery. And I hesitated there just to make sure you got that because it's taking blood away from the heart. And this is my right pulmonary artery. So this is my right and left pulmonary artery. And so blood goes, now, into my lungs."
Health,"These are the lungs that are kind of nestled into my thorax, where my heart is sitting. It goes into my lungs. And remember, this blood is blue. Why is it blue? Well, it's blue because it doesn't have very much oxygen. And so one thing that I need to pick up is oxygen. And so that's one thing that the lungs are going to help me pick up. And I'm going to write O2 for oxygen. And it's also blue. And that reminds us that it's full of carbon dioxide. It's full of waste because it's coming from the body."
Health,"And the body's made a lot of carbon dioxide that it's trying to get rid of. So in the lungs, you get rid of your carbon dioxide and you pick up oxygen. So that's why I switch, at this point, from a blue-colored vessel to a red-colored vessel. So now blood comes back in this way and this way and dumps into this chamber. So what is that? This is our left atrium. So just like our right atrium, we have one on the left."
Health,"And it goes down into-- and you can probably guess what this one is called-- it's our left ventricle. So just like before, where it went from the right atrium to the right ventricle, now we're going from the left atrium to the left ventricle. And it passes through a valve here. So this valve is called the mitral valve. And its job is, of course, to make sure that blood does not go from the left ventricle back to the left atrium by accident. It wants to make sure that there's forward flow."
Health,"And then the final valve-- I have to find a nice spot to write it, maybe right here. This final valve that it passes through is called the aortic valve. And the aortic valve is going to be what divides the left ventricle from this giant vessel that we talked about earlier. And this is, of course, the aorta. This is my aorta. So now blood is going to go through the aorta to the rest of the body. So you can see how blood now flows from the body into the four chambers."
Health,"First into the right atrium-- this is chamber number one. And then it goes into the right ventricle. This is chamber number two. It goes to the lungs and then back out to the left atrium. So this is chamber number three. And then the left ventricle. And this happens every moment of every day. Every time you hear your heart beating, this process is going on.."
Health,"And I realize it looks a little bit scary. But once I start labeling stuff, you'll start seeing that it's actually not as bad as it seems. So let's get started in the upper part of the heart. The right atrium is right there, and then blood goes down into the right ventricle. And then on the other side, I'm going to label the last two chambers, the left atrium and the left ventricle. And we're going to actually follow the path of blood after it leaves the right ventricle."
Health,"We're going to start our journey here at the right ventricle. So what's the first thing that kind of comes across? Well, blood leaves the right ventricle, goes through a valve. And after, on the other side, you've got this area right here. And I've drawn it as one tube with no split, and this is the pulmonary trunk. So blood is headed towards the lungs, going first through the trunk. And of course, after the trunk there's a left and right. So I'll write that up here. The pulmonary arteries are next."
Health,"And remember, I call them arteries because they're going away from the heart. And there are two arteries. So pulmonary arteries, left and right pulmonary arteries. And that's why you see two things here. One here, and you see one here. And those are basically tubes. So it's going from the pulmonary trunk. It's splitting into one of the two tubes. And now I'm drawing the left and right lung up top. And of course, you know that the lungs are actually not going to look this way."
Health,"So this is not anatomically correct. But this is not, as I said in the beginning, a bad way of thinking about it. So blood goes through the lungs and then comes out on the other side. And there we're going to talk about left and right pulmonary veins. And actually, here I'm going to make the point that there aren't just two pulmonary veins, one for each lung. Actually, there are usually more than that."
Health,"And so when I draw this, too, I really want you to just think of the two sides, veins coming from both sides. But the actual number could be a few pulmonary veins in total. The pulmonary veins drain blood, then, into the left atrium, right? So now we're on the other side of the heart. And for the moment, I'm going to kind of pause the journey here. So we've gone from the right ventricle, around to the lungs, back again in the left atrium. And this is kind of the first part of our journey."
Health,"And this part of the journey is called the pulmonary circulation. I'm actually just going to write that here. Pulmonary circulation. So the fact that this part is going-- starting from the heart and going back to the heart is one circuit, and our heart actually has two circuits. But I want to point out the circuits one at a time, and we've already kind of completed one circuit. So I'm going to take some blue paint to indicate deoxygenated blood, or blood without oxygen."
Health,"I'm going to paint in how it would look. And actually, it stopped there because my arrows. But you can actually see now the deoxygenated blood kind of goes from the right ventricle, through the pulmonary trunk, through the arteries, and into the left and right lung. And once it's there, it's going to kind of mix in with the capillaries. And it's going to start getting oxygen, and then it's going to come out on the other side in the pulmonary veins."
Health,"And it's again stopped a little bit there, but I can fill it in. And the pulmonary veins are going to deliver that oxygenated blood to the left atrium. So what you see kind of colored in now is the pulmonary circulation. That's the first part of our circuit. But let's now keep going and now talk about the second part of the circulatory system, which is the systemic circulation. So now the journey starts with the left ventricle, so let me start there."
Health,"So for the systemic circulation, I'm going to start the left ventricle. And it's going to go around to the body, right? The body is kind of the thing that's going to be receiving all of the blood. And when I say body, I really mean lots of things. I mean things like the brain, so it could be an organ like the brain or the liver. It could also be maybe things like bones, if you have bones in your fingers. Could be the toes."
Health,"Could be any part of your body that you can think of, right? So all these different organs and tissues are going to be getting blood from the left ventricle. It's going to be going initially through a giant vessel. This vessel I'm going to label it say, here, as the aorta. So this large vessel is the aorta. And of course, it branches and splits. And I haven't shown all the branches that come off the aorta. But there are many, many of them."
Health,"It goes to the various tissues and organs, and then it comes back out on the other side. And at the end, kind of somewhere up here, it's going to go back to the right atrium. And it generally travels through two major kind of vessels. One is the inferior, and the other is the superior, meaning lower and upper. And they're both called vena cava. So superior vena cava and inferior vena cava. I'll just write that here."
Health,"So these are the two major veins that are bringing back blood from all the different parts of the body. And so now you've actually seen the second circulation, because it all ends at the right atrium. And this is the systemic circulation. I'm going to write systemic circulation here. So now you can see that the heart is really two different systems-- or let's say two different circuits, rather. And the first one, the pulmonary circulation, is really kind of relying on the right ventricle as the pump."
Health,"And the second one is relying on the left ventricle as the pump. And actually, now that you've seen it, I can now color it in. There it would kind of deliver all the blood to the various organs, and then the organs would use up the oxygen. So let me show it kind of now going back to blue just to indicate deoxygenated blood, and it goes back to the right atrium as deoxygenated blood. So this is kind of how we sometimes see it."
Health,"And again, this doesn't show you or give you an appreciation for the anatomy exactly, where things branch off and where the different names make sense. But you get a kind of overall feel for the fact that we have two different circulations, and you can see where the blood is going for the two different circuits. Now, when you look at this picture, you could say, well, OK, I guess you can see where all the different tissues are getting the blood."
Health,"Basically sounds like everything is coming from the oxygenated blood coming out of the left ventricle. But some tissues always kind of trip people up or kind of spark a question, and I'm just going to kind of try to target a couple of the tissues that I think people sometimes might have questions about. And one of them-- wouldn't really call it a tissue, but you could definitely call it a cell type. It's the RBC, and RBC just stands for red blood cell."
Health,"So people sometimes wonder if the red blood cells are carrying blood to other parts of the body, then how do they themselves get oxygen? Do they just kind of use up some of the oxygen that they're carrying, or what exactly? And to answer this question, I would have to remind you that a red blood cell basically looks a little bit like this in cross-section. And it doesn't have any mitochondria. No mitochondria. So it has no mitochondria."
Health,"And remember, mitochondria are these tiny little organelles inside of cells that are using oxygen. So if it has no mitochondria, then it is not really using oxygen. So it's not using oxygen. And really, these cells-- we call them cells, and they are in many senses of the word. But they don't really have mitochondria. They also don't have a nucleus."
Health,"I mean, these are, literally, these amazingly designed cells that are made for the purpose of carrying around oxygen to the body, because they literally are bags of hemoglobin. So just remember, red blood cells don't really need oxygen. They simply carry it around. Another tissue or organ that makes people kind of wonder is the heart. The heart is pumping all the blood around."
Health,"But does it actually get oxygen from vessels that are in the pulmonary circulation or from the systemic circulation or what? And here, the short answer is systemic circulation. That's kind of the quick answer. And let me actually show you where the blood vessels come from. These are called coronary vessels. I'll just write the word coronary here, coronary vessels. So coronary artery and vein. And these coronary vessels, they actually come right off the aorta here and here."
Health,"So they kind of come off of the aorta right away. They're the first branches off the aorta, actually. So the first branches go and serve the heart, so it's kind of the first to get systemic circulation blood. And the veins actually drain into a spot directly into the right atrium, so there's actually a little spot right there that they drain into. So the blood from the arterial side is coming from the aorta. And on the venous side, it's actually not even dumping into the inferior or superior vena cava."
Health,"Kind of a little known fact, it's going directly into the right atrium. And finally, kind of a tricky one, but the lungs. Where do the lungs get their oxygen from? And this is, I say, tricky. And I kind of saved this for last, because there are actually blood vessels. And again, don't worry so much about the anatomy in terms of where is it coming off of exactly? But it's coming off of the systemic circulation, and you've got a vessel going to the right lung. Let's say something like that."
Health,"And you've got another vessel going-- I'll just draw it kind of going-- to the left lung like that. So you've got a couple of arteries that are branching off, and these are also part of the systemic circulation. And these are called the bronchial arteries. And these bronchial arteries bring then really wonderful oxygenated blood, right? These are the bronchial arteries. And you might say, well, that wasn't so difficult. I'll say bronchial vessels, because there are also some veins coming off."
Health,"Actually, let me draw the veins now for you, so you can see how those kind of end up. And these veins, they come from, of course, the right lung. And they actually end up dumping in here. You can't really show blue on blue, but just trust they go there. And you've got another vein from the other lung, kind of following a parallel path and going into the veins as well."
Health,"And so they don't dump necessarily directly into the inferior or superior vena cava, but I just want to show that they go into the venous side on the systemic circulation. So if that was it, that would be really simple. But actually, lungs are kind of interesting in the sense that there is a lot of mixing going on. So you've got pulmonary arteries carrying blood. You've got bronchial arteries carrying blood, and that blood mixes."
Health,"And then you've got-- at the capillaries, you've got some blood kind of from both places, the pulmonary circulation and blood from the systemic circulation again mixing. And then on the other side, where the veins are bringing blood back to the heart, most of the blood-- as it turns out, most of the blood actually goes this way, into the pulmonary veins."
Health,"So even though you have bronchial arteries bringing blood in-- that would be right here-- you only have bronchial arteries bringing blood in, a lot of that blood ends up going into the pulmonary circulation. So that's kind of an interesting fact, that not as much goes this way directly into that systemic circulation. So it's kind of a tricky thing to keep in mind. But the lungs, then, technically really are getting blood both from the systemic circulation, but also they're kind of mixing blood."
Health,"And they're mixing blood with the pulmonary circulation. We'll talk a little bit more about this in another video. I don't want you to feel like this kind of got too confusing. But I just want you to be aware that there is mixing going on in the lungs with the systemic and pulmonary circulation, kind of a neat organ in that sense.."
Health,"And one of the things that keeps the blood flowing in the right direction, we know, is the valves. And two of the valves I'm actually going to give you new names, something slightly different from what we have been referring to them by. These are the atrioventricular valves, and you can take a guess as to which ones I'm referring to. Atrioventricular valves are the two valves between the atria and the ventricles. So one will be the tricuspid valve, and the other is the mitral valve."
Health,"And just to orient us, this is the tricuspid, the T. And this is our mitral, or M. And the atrioventricular valves, these two valves, if you look at them, they're both facing downwards. And one of the things that you might be wondering is, well, how is it that they aren't just flopping back and forth? And these valves, in particular, have a very interesting strategy. And that is that they actually are tethered to the walls."
Health,"So they're held down here like that, and they have on the other end of those tethers a little muscle there. Now, this makes perfect sense if you think about it, because the ventricles are very strong. We know the ventricles are really, really strong. And so if the ventricles are squeezing, there's a good chance that that blood is going to shoot up in any direction it can go."
Health,"It's going to go back perhaps through the mitral valve if it can go there, or it'll go through that tricuspid valve if it can go there. But the reason that it won't is that these papillary muscles are basically kind of sending out little lifelines, these chordae tendineae lifelines, to keep the valve from flipping backwards. So these chordae tendineae, these cords, are important for that reason. They're keeping the valve from flipping backwards."
Health,"So these are all chordae tendineae, and these are all the papillary muscles. And these are particularly important, then, we can tell, for when you're trying to make sure that the ventricles don't screw up the valves. And now let's say that by accident our ventricle is just too strong, too powerful. Let's say that it broke one of these cords. Let's say it broke this one right here. And that's because our ventricle was just forcing too much blood back, and it just snapped the cord."
Health,"What would happen? Well, this would basically kind of start flipping back and forth. It would flip this way and this way. And then on the next heartbeat, blood would start going the wrong direction, because this valve is not able to keep that nice tight seal. And so blood would basically kind of go this way when it wasn't supposed to. And all of a sudden, our flow of blood is now going in the wrong direction."
Health,"So the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles do a really, really important job in preventing that from happening. So let's move our attention to another area. Let's focus on this right here, which is the interventricular septum. And you can think of septum as basically a wall, interventricular septum. In this interventricular septum, the one thing I want to point out, which is maybe fairly obvious when you look at it-- you might think, well, why did you even have to say it? That's pretty obvious."
Health,"This area is really thin, and this area is really thick by comparison. So the two areas are not equal in size. This is much thicker. And the reason I wanted to bring that up is because this first area in blue is called the membranous part, literally like a membrane. And the bottom, the red part, is the muscular part. This is the strong muscular part. So you have two different areas in that interventricular septum, the wall between the ventricles."
Health,"And one of the interesting things about the membranous part, in particular, is that a lot of babies are born with holes in that membranous part. So when I say a lot, I don't mean the majority of babies, by any means."
Health,"But one of the most common defects, if there is going to be a defect, would be that you would actually have a communication between these two so that blood could actually, again, flow from a place that it's not supposed to go, the left ventricle, into a place it shouldn't be going, the right ventricle. So blood can actually flow through those holes, and that is a problem. That is called a VSD. And actually, you might hear that term at some point. So I just wanted to point out where that happens."
Health,"And while I'm writing VSD, you can take a stab at guessing what it might stand for. Ventricular, and S is septal. Again, septal just means wall. And D is defect. So a VSD is most common in that membranous part, more so than that muscular part. Now, let's move on again to one final thing I want to point out, which is I want to zoom in on the walls. So here in a gray box I'm going to kind of highlight what's going on this wall and how many layers there are in this wall."
Health,"Let me draw out a little rectangle to correspond to that little rectangle I drew on the heart itself. So there are three layers to the heart muscle. And actually, I'm going to go through all three layers. And we'll start from the inside and work our way out. So on the inside, you have what's called the endocardium. And I'm actually going to draw the endocardium all the way around here. It goes all the way around the valves, so now you already learned that the valves now have endocardium."
Health,"It goes around the ventricle and, as I showed you in the beginning, also around the atrium. And it goes all the way up and covers both the right and left side. The endocardium is very, very similar in many ways to the inner lining of the blood vessels, actually. So it's a really thin layer. It's not a very thick layer. It's the layer that all the red blood cells are kind of bumping up against."
Health,"So when the red blood cells are entering the chambers of the heart, the part that they're going to see is going to be the endocardium. So this is what it looks like, and this is that green layer all the way around that I've drawn now. So if I was to draw it kind of in a blown-up version, it might look like this. Right? And it's a few cell layers thick. And like I said, on the inside you have some red blood cells bumping along. So maybe this is one red blood cell, and this is maybe another one."
Health,"And they would bump into that endocardium. Now, if you go a little bit deeper to the endocardium, what do you get to next? Well, next you get to myocardium. And that would be, let's say, the biggest chunk of our wall. And that would look something like this. And that myocardium you can kind of appreciate without even having me point it out, because it's the most common part of this entire thing. So this is our myocardium, and let me go back and actually label the endocardium as well."
Health,"And on the other side-- and actually, just notice that the words are all pretty similar. Myo means muscle. And actually, while I'm on myocardium, let me just point out one more thing. The myocardium is where all of the contractile muscle is going to be, so that's where a lot of the work is being done. And that's also where a lot of the energy is being used up. So when the heart needs oxygen, it's usually the myocardium, because that's the part that's doing all of the work."
Health,"Now, on the other side of myocardium, what do we have on the outside? Well, we have a layer called the pericardium, and let me try to draw that in for you. Pericardium is something like this, kind of a thin layer. And the interesting thing about pericardium is that there's actually two layers to it. So there's actually something like this where you have two layers, an inner layer and an outer layer. And between the two layers you have literally a gap. There's a gap right there."
Health,"And in that gap, you might have a little bit of fluid. But it's not actually cells. I guess that's the biggest point. It's not actually cells. It's more just a little bit of fluid that hangs out there. So this whole thing is called the pericardium. Now, you may be wondering how in the world do you get a layer that has a gap within it. So let me actually try to show you what happens in a fetus."
Health,"So let's say you have a little fetus heart, a tiny little heart like this, and it gets a little bit bigger like this. And then it finally gets into an adult heart, something like that. So this would be the adult heart, right? Well, at the same time that the heart is growing, you actually also have a sac, almost like a little balloon. And this balloon actually begins to envelope the heart, so this growing heart kind of grows right into the balloon."
Health,"And so this balloon kind of starts going around it like that, and you get something like this. And then eventually, as the heart gets really big, you get something like this. You basically have this kind of inner layer of the balloon that's pancaked out that doesn't even look like a balloon anymore. It's very flat, and then it kind of folds back on itself like that. And it comes all the way around. And now you can see why even though it's continuous-- it's not like it breaks."
Health,"It is continuous here-- you can see how if you actually just were to look at one chunk of it, like we're looking at right here, you can see how it would actually look like a pancake. And so on our heart actually, it literally would be something like this, like a very thin kind of pancake. And I'm not doing a very, very good job making it look thin, but you can imagine what it is that it could look like if I was to zoom in on it."
Health,"Basically, something like that, where you have two layers that are basically just kind of turned in on themselves. And both layers put together are called your pericardium. Now, there are actually separate names for the two layers. So for example, the layer that's kind of hugging up against the heart, this layer that I'm drawing right now, this layer is called the visceral pericardium. So you call that the visceral pericardium. And the name visceral, this right here, would be visceral."
Health,"And the reason it's called visceral is because viscera refers to organs, so that's called the visceral pericardium. And then this outer layer, the one I'm drawing now, is called the parietal pericardium. And that's the layer that actually is on the outside, so let me label that as well. So that's this guy. That would be the parietal pericardium. So now you can actually see the layers of the heart-- the endocardium, myocardium, and pericardium."
Health,"And actually, just to throw you a curve ball, because I'm pretty sure you can handle it, this visceral pericardium, another name for it, just because you might see it sometime, is the epicardium. Sometimes you might see the name epicardium. And don't get thrown off. It's really just the visceral pericardium. It's just the outermost layer of that heart before you get to the parietal layer.."
Health,"And so maybe that represents how much oxygen they have. And so one possible explanation is that arteries carry oxygenated blood, oxygenated, oxygenated blood, while veins carry deoxygenated blood. So blood that has less oxygen now. Now this is actually incorrect. It is, many times, the case that arteries are the ones carrying oxygenated blood and veins are carrying the deoxygenated blood. But as we will see, this is not always the case."
Health,"And since we're already talking about oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood and the colors red and blue, it's worth addressing another misconception. Many times it is said that deoxygenated blood looks blue, and the reason why people believe that is if you look at your wrist and you're able to see some of the vessels in there, you will see some blue vessels. And those, or at least they look blue when you're looking from the outside of your skin. And those, indeed, are veins."
Health,"And so that's where the misconception has come from, that veins, which, in your arm, are carrying deoxygenated blood. That that deoxygenated blood is blue. It turns out that it is not blue. It is just a deeper red. And the reason why the veins look blue is because of the optics of light going through your skin and then seeing the outside of the veins and then reflecting back. That is not the color of the actual blood. So so far I have not given you a clear definition of what arteries versus veins are."
Health,"A better definition, so let me cross these two out, are that arteries carry blood away from the heart. Away from the heart. And veins carry blood towards the heart. Towards the heart. And I can get a zoomed in image of the heart right here and that will make it a little bit clearer. And you can also see, or we're about to see, why this first definition, or this first distinction between arteries and veins does not always hold. So let's just imagine some blood that is being pumped away from the heart."
Health,"So right when it gets pumped away from the heart, it'll be right over here. It gets pumped through the aorta, and you can see the aorta branches, so some blood can go up towards your head, and if it didn't, you would pass out and die. And then a lot of the blood goes down towards the rest of your body. And that, indeed, is the most oxygenated blood. And so it'll flow through your body."
Health,"And these arteries will keep branching and branching into smaller vessels, all the way until they form these very small branches. And it's that place, especially, where they will lose a lot of their oxygen to the fluid and the cells around them. And then the blood is less oxygenated. And then even though deoxygenated blood is not blue, it often gets depicted as blue in a lot of diagrams. So I will do the same. And these vessels start building into your veins."
Health,"And these really small vessels that really bridge between arteries and veins, where a lot of the gas and nutrient exchange occurs, these are called capillaries. And so after going through the capillaries, the blood will then come back to the heart and now it's coming towards the heart through the veins. It comes into the right atrium, then the right ventricle. Then that gets pumped towards the lungs. And this is the exception to the first incorrect definition of arteries and veins that we looked at."
Health,"This right over here, is an artery. Even though it's carrying less oxygenated or deoxygenated blood, it's an artery because it's carrying blood away from the heart. But in this case, it's not carrying it to the rest of the body, it is carrying it to the lungs. That is why it is called the pulmonary artery, even though it's carrying less oxygenated blood. So that it goes to the lungs and then, in the lungs, there's more gas exchange that occurs. The blood gets oxygenated and then it comes back to the heart."
Health,"And so it comes back to the heart in these vessels right over here, and that even though these are carrying highly oxygenated blood, these are considered veins because they're carrying blood towards the heart. So these are pulmonary veins. And then the cycle starts again. The pulmonary veins bring the oxygenated blood into the left atrium and the left ventricle, and then that pumps it to the rest of the body to the aorta, for your systemic circulation."
Health,"You have your pulmonary circulation, which circulates the blood to, through and from the lungs. And you have your systemic circulation, which takes the blood to and from the rest of the body. So now that we have this main distinction between arteries and veins, what are some other interesting things that we know about it? Well one thing to keep in mind is that since arteries are being pumped directly by the heart towards the rest of the body, they have high pressure. I'll write that in caps. High pressure."
Health,"And so if you were to have an accident of some type, which you do not want to have, and you were to accidentally cut an artery, because of that high pressure, it would actually spurt blood, a lot more than if you were to cut a vein. And most of the times where you get a cut, you're really just cutting capillaries. Like if you were to prick your finger, it's usually a series of capillaries that get cut, and that's why the blood would come out very very slowly."
Health,"Now if arteries are high pressure, veins are low pressure. Low, low pressure. And one way to think about it is the arteries, the blood is being pumped directly by the heart. But then once it goes through the capillaries and comes back through the veins, it's kind of sluggishly making its way back to the heart. It's not being directly pumped."
Health,"And that's why in veins, because you don't have that high pressure to bring everything back to the heart, you have these valves that make sure that for the most part, the blood is going in one direction. I'm going to draw the blood in red in the veins, just so we don't keep going with that misconception, that blood in the veins is blue somehow."
Health,"Now related to the fact that the blood in the arteries is under higher pressure, in order to transport a fixed volume of blood in a certain amount of time, you need less volume. And so that's why arteries are low volume. And on the other hand, veins are high volume. And to appreciate the difference, the blood volume in arteries are only approximately 15% of the entire blood volume in your body, while the blood volume in veins are closer to 65%, approximately 65%."
Health,"And if you're wondering where the rest of the blood is, about five percent is in capillaries, five percent is in your heart, and about 10% is in your lungs. So I will leave you there. The big take away: arteries are the vessels that take blood away from the heart. Veins are the vessels that take blood towards the heart.."
Health,"Now, to start the journey, it's going to have to go out of the left ventricle and into the largest artery of the body. This is going to be the aorta. And the aorta is very, very wide across. And that's why I say it's a large artery. And from the aorta-- I'm actually not drawing all the branches of the aorta. But from the aorta, it's going to go down into my belly. And it's going to branch towards my left leg and my right leg. So let's say we follow just the left leg."
Health,"So this artery over here on the top, it's going to get a little bit smaller. And maybe I'd call this a medium-sized artery by this point. This is actually now getting down towards my ankle. Let's say we've gone quite a distance down in my ankle. And then there are, of course, little branches. And let's just follow the branch that goes towards my foot, which is this top one. Let's say this one goes towards my foot, and this is going to be now an even smaller artery. Let's call it small artery."
Health,"From there, we're actually going to get into what we call arterioles, so it's going to get even tinier. It's going to branch. Now, these are very, very tiny branches coming off my small artery. And let's follow this one right here, and this one is my arteriole. So these are all the different branches I have to go through. And finally, I'm going to get into tiny little branches. I'm going to have to draw them very, very skinny just to convince you that we're getting smaller and smaller."
Health,"Let me draw three of them. Let's draw four just for fun. And this is actually going to now get towards my little toe cells. So let me draw some toes cells in here to convince you that I actually have gotten there. Let's say one, two over here, and maybe one over here. These are my toes cells. And after the toe cells have kind of taken out whatever they need-- maybe they need glucose or maybe they need some oxygen. Whatever they've taken out, they're also going to put in their waste."
Health,"So they have, of course, some carbon dioxide waste that we need to drag back. This is now going to dump into what we call a venule. And this venule is going to basically then feed into many, many other venules. Maybe there's a venule down here coming in, and maybe a venule up here coming in maybe from the second toe. And it's going to basically all kind of gather together, and again, to a giant, giant set of veins. Maybe veins are dumping in here now, maybe another vein dumping in here."
Health,"And these veins are all going to dump into an enormous vein that we call the inferior vena cava. I'll write that right here, inferior vena cava. And this is the large vein that brings back all the blood from the bottom half of the body. There's also another one over here called the superior vena cava, and this is bringing back blood from the arms and head. So these two veins, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, are dragging the blood back to the heart."
Health,"And generally speaking, these are all considered, of course, veins. Let's back up now and start with the large and medium arteries. These guys together are sometimes referred to as elastic arteries. And the reason they're called elastic arteries, one of the good reasons why they're called that is that they have a protein in the walls of the blood vessel called elastin. They have a lot of this elastin protein."
Health,"And if you think about the word elastin or elastic-- obviously very similar words-- you might think of something like a rubber band or a balloon. And that's probably the easiest way to think about it. If you have a blood vessel, one of these large arteries, for example, and let's say blood is under a lot of pressure because the heart is squeezing out a lot of high pressure blood, this artery is literally going to balloon out."
Health,"And if you actually looked at it from the outside, it would look like a little sausage, something like this where it's puffed out. So what's happened there between the first and second picture is that the pressure energy-- so the heart is squeezing out a lot of pressurized blood. And, of course, there's energy in that blood. That pressure energy has been converted over into elastic energy. It's actually converting energy. We don't really always think about it that way, but that's exactly what's happening."
Health,"And when you convert from pressure energy to elastic energy, what you're really then doing is you're balancing out those high pressures. So you're balancing out high pressures. And this is actually very important, because the blood that's coming into our arteries is under, let's not forget, high pressure. So the arterial system we know is a high-pressure system."
Health,"So this makes perfect sense that the first few arteries, those large arteries and even those medium-sized arteries, are going to be able to deal with the pressure really well. Now, let me draw a little line here just to keep it straight. The small artery and the arteriole, these two are actually sometimes called the muscular arteries. And the reason, again, if you just want to look at the wall of the artery, you'll get the answer. The wall of the artery is actually very muscular."
Health,"In fact, specifically, it's smooth muscle. So not the kind of muscle you have in your heart or in your biceps, but this is smooth muscle that's in the wall of the artery. And there's lots of it. So again, if you have a little blood vessel like this, if you imagine tons and tons of smooth muscle on the outside-- so let's draw it like this, little bands of smooth muscle."
Health,"If those bands decide that they want to contract down, that they want to squeeze down, you're going to get something that looks like a little straw, because those muscles are now tight. They're tightly wound, so you're going to create like a little straw. And this process is called vasoconstriction. Vaso just means blood vessel. And constriction is kind of tightening down. So vasoconstriction, tightening down of the blood vessel. And what that does is it increases resistance."
Health,"Just like if you're trying to blow through a tiny, tiny little straw, there's a lot of resistance. Well, it's the same idea here. And actually, a lot of that resistance and change in the vasoconstriction is happening at the arteriole level. So that's why they're very special and I want you to remember them. From there, blood is going to go through the capillaries. I didn't actually label them the first time, but let me just write that here. Some, as they call them, capillary beds. I'll write that out."
Health,"And then it's going to go and get collected in the venules and eventually into the veins. And the important thing about the veins-- I'm going to stop right here and just talk about it very briefly-- is that they have these little valves. And these valves make sure that the blood continues to flow in one direction. So one important thing here is the valves. And remember, the other important thing is that they are able to deal with large volumes."
Health,"So unlike the arterial side where it was all about large pressure, down here with the vein side, we have to think about large volumes. Remember about 2/3 of your blood at any point in time is sitting in some vein or venule somewhere.."
Health,"And this tube is like a blood vessel. So there's blood trying to get its way from one side to the other. And on its way, the neat thing that it's doing is as it flows, it's pushing out. So it's forcing against these walls, and specifically what I mean by that is there are cells and there's plasma, and all that stuff is pushing out against the walls of the blood vessels. So you've got a force, and that force is being exerted on the surface area of the blood vessel. So it's force over a surface area."
Health,"And any time you see force over an area, you know that equals a pressure. And in this case, it's a blood pressure because it's the blood that's doing that work. So this is how I think of blood pressure, specifically as those little blue arrows. And the two questions that kind of pop into my mind anytime I'm thinking about blood pressure are where is the blood pressure being taken, and when are you taking it? So let's start with the first question, where? And by that I mean where in the circulatory system."
Health,"So you've got the heart-- and this is my Valentine's Day heart-- and you've got the aorta coming off of the heart. And it's got lots of branches, but I'm going to just draw one branch, which is the artery leading off to my arms. This is called the brachial artery going off to my arm. And usually, I'd say 90% of the time, maybe even more, the blood pressure that you're getting recorded, or the number that's being told to you, is being checked at this point."
Health,"I marked it with a little x because that's kind of the upper arm. So that's usually where they're checking the blood pressure. And again, they're checking the force that the blood is putting on the vessel walls. So these little blue arrows. So that answers the where question. And certainly, you can imagine if I checked blood pressure let's say at some other spot, let's say over here or over here, you might get a different blood pressure reading than if I checked it at the yellow x."
Health,"So really were just talking about that one spot. Now the other question is when are you checking it? So for this, let me show you a little table or a figure, rather. So imagine that over time, time is this way, you have different recordings for blood pressure. So this will be blood pressure. And blood pressure is usually measured in millimeters of mercury. So I'll write millimeters of mercury here. And let's go from 200 all the way down to 0."
Health,"And I'll use my numbers that I got from the doctor the other day to illustrate what I'm trying to say. So right at that yellow x, at the bottom, let's say of my reading I've got 75. So let's start at 75, which is about here. As the heart is pumping, the pressure starts building up. And it gets up to about 115. So really what is happening is blood is making its way from the heart as it squeezes towards that x. And as it gets there, the force that it's putting on the walls is going up, up, up."
Health,"And as it goes up, it goes from 75 all the way to 115. So that all happens during the squeezing part of the heart cycle. We call that systole. So this is all happening during systole, which is when the heart is squeezing down, and we know the heart is a pump. Now from that point forward, the heart begins to relax. So at this point, at 115, the heart is now relaxing slowly. And as it relaxes, the pressure begins to fall. And it continues to fall all the way out here."
Health,"And the pressure gets down to about 75 again. And this is diastole. So this is when the heart is actually taking a break from squeezing and is now refilling, and we call that diastole. So I'll call that refilling. And so during systole, you spend about 1/3 of the time. And in diastole, you spend about 2/3 of the time. And I'm talking about one heartbeat here. So this would be one heartbeat. So it's not 50-50."
Health,"And the easy way to remember this is in a given day, 24 hour day, I spend about 8 hours working and about 16 hours relaxing, or not working. And so I think of the heart doing its squeezing, its work, for eight out of 24 would be about 1/3. Kind of the same as me. About 1/3 of the time, the heart is squeezing. So that's how the heart is spending its time, in systole and diastole. And the pressure is ranging between 115 and 75. So really it's never just 115 or just 75. It's somewhere between the two."
Health,"And for example, if I checked right here in time, it might be let's say 85, or here it might be 102, or here it might be 87. So it's somewhere between 115 and 75. So this number I wrote up here becomes the range. This is the range of blood pressure. So when I talk about when, it really depends on when in the cycle you're at and you're somewhere in that range. And when I talk about the where, we know that we're talking about a reading that's taken in the upper arm."
Health,"So those are the two thoughts that should cross your mind every time you hear a blood pressure recording. And of course, the top number, 115 again, is the systolic blood pressure. And 75 is the diastolic blood pressure.."
Health,"That's the part that we, as humans, need to survive. So you take a deep breath, and let's say that you take it through your mouth. You take a deep breath through your mouth. And then let's say you take one more deep breath, a second deep breath. And you take that one through your nose. Now you might think, well, these are two totally different ways of getting in air. That's certainly how it looks when you look at a mouth and a nose. It doesn't look like they have much in common."
Health,"But the truth is that actually. If you follow the air, it almost follows an identical path. So the air is going to go into the back of the throat, really regardless of how you took it in. So here we have air coming in from the nose. And here you have air coming in from the mouth. And they meet up in the back of the throat. And then they go down, down, down. They go towards this thing that we call the Adam's apple. I'm going to bring up a little bit of the canvas so you can see it more easily."
Health,"But basically, you see this Adam's apple right here. And actually you can go ahead and take a feel of your own Adam's apple. It's a pretty cool structure in the middle of your throat, and everybody has it. That's the first thing I want to tell you is that everybody has it, not just men. Women have it too. And the reason it's called an Adam's apple, it's called an Adam's apple because Adam is generally a boy's name. And so it's to remind us that usually men or boys have larger Adam's apples than girls."
Health,"And if you're trying to find it, I just also want to point out there's this notch here. And if you can feel the notch with your fingers, that gives you a nice clue as to where it's located. But this is it. This is the Adam's apple. And what it does is it helps you control your voice. And actually, another name for the Adam's apple, sometimes people call it the voice box. The voice box. And of course, air is passing through the voice box, and it's kind of the entryway into the trachea."
Health,"And so it actually allows me to (FALSETTO) make my voice really high, (DEEP BARITONE) or make my voice very low, depending on how you change the muscles around in that Adam's apple. So that's actually the kind of first cool thing I want to point out to you is that you can actually control your voice. I'm sure you knew this already, but what you're using is your Adam's apple, or your voice box. Now air keeps going."
Health,"Air is just going to keep making its journey down-- and specifically, of course, the part of air I said we care about is the oxygen. It's going to keep making its journey down into the lung area. So this is now the lung area. It's going down the trachea, and it goes into the two lungs-- the right and left lung. This is the left lung. I'm going to put L for left. And this is the right lung. I'll put R for right."
Health,"And immediately you're thinking, well, wait a second, aren't they switched? I want you to remember that this is from the perspective of the person who owns the lungs, so that's why I'm putting left where I put it and right where I put it. Now we should probably go ahead and start labeling some of this. You can see that the lungs actually don't look identical. They look slightly different. For example, this one has three lobes. The right side has three lobes."
Health,"We call it the upper lobe, middle lobe and lower lobe. And the left one only has two lobes. So that's the first kind of big difference. And the other difference is that you actually have this thing in the middle that we call a cardiac notch. This thing right here, this is called the cardiac notch. And the reason we call it that is that it's a little spot that gets formed because the heart is literally kind of peeking out here. And as a result, it kind of makes a notch in the lungs when it develops."
Health,"So the heart takes up a little bit of space here. This is our heart. And as a result, it makes that notch. So this is our heart space here. So on the other side, you've got, of course, your two lobes-- your upper and lower lobe. And these are two clues, so if you ever see a lung just kind of sitting by itself and you want to figure out whether it's the left lung or the right lung, you can look for the number of lobes, or you can look for that cardiac notch. Now around these lungs, you've got ribs."
Health,"So you've got ribs here, and between the ribs, you've got rib muscles. And they are, of course, on both sides. And below the lungs and below the heart, you've got a big muscle. Actually it's going to come through here. I'm going to just kind of go through the word heart. And it basically becomes the floor. So the heart and the two lungs, they sit on this floor made up of this muscle. And this muscle is the diaphragm muscle. So this diaphragm muscle makes up the floor. The ribs make up the walls."
Health,"So what do we have? We have basically a room. We have a giant room with walls and a floor. And this entire room we actually call the thorax. So within this room then, you have your two lungs and your heart. So far, so good. But I haven't done a very nice job of actually showing you where the air goes. I've just kind of pointed that it goes through the two lungs, but you don't actually get to see where it goes after that. So I'm going to erase a lot of this."
Health,"I'm going to reveal to you what it would look like if you could slip on some X-ray glasses and look at your two lungs. This is kind of what it would look like. You've got all this interesting architecture. And the easiest way to think about this, probably the simplest way to think about this, is to imagine a tree. So imagine a tree, and that tree has been flipped upside down. So you've got all these branches off that tree. And they're branching and branching."
Health,"And if you flip this tree upside down, you start seeing that it looks a lot like what we have in our lungs. Our lungs basically look like a flipped upside down tree. And we even call it that. We even call this entire structure, we call it a bronchial tree. So when you look at the lungs and they look kind of messy or complicated, just think of them as an upside down bronchial tree, and all of a sudden it'll look much simpler. Basically in the middle, you've got this nice trunk. Right? This is our trunk."
Health,"And then it starts kind of branching from there. So air goes down this main trunk, this trachea, and then it kind of starts splitting up. And each of these colored regions-- the green region or the purple region-- serves a different lobe. So this green region serves the lower lobe down here. The purple serves the upper lobe."
Health,"And on this side, you've got an upper, a middle, and a lower Now I know it looks a little bit strange, because you've got some green branches in what should be the middle lobe, like right here. You've got some orange branches in what looks like the upper lobe, like right there. But what you have to remember-- and this is kind of tricky to do and just try to play with it in your head-- is that what you have is basically a three-dimensional lung."
Health,"So you have to imagine that we are only looking at it from the front side. But, of course, that middle lobe does go back. And if it went back, then you'd make perfect sense of why the orange branches are where they're at. Now let me continue the air journey, because I want to make sure we finish it off. So let's say we take a little branch like this, we expand it. We keep zooming into it, zooming into it, zooming into until it's microscopic."
Health,"You can't see it with your eyes anymore, but you could see it under a microscope. It would look like this. It would basically, under a microscope, look like a bunch of little sacs like this. And these sacs, we call these alveoli. Alveoli. And the air actually kind of runs into the alveoli. It has a dead end, and then it comes back around. And then you breathe it out. So that's how breathing works. The air goes all the way in through your mouth, down to the alveoli, takes a U-turn, and then goes back out."
Health,"But before it does that, before it leaves, very close to the alveoli is blood. And let's say blood is coming this way and going that way. And what will happen is that actually into the blood will go oxygen. Oxygen will actually go into the blood. And out of the blood will be waste. So you'll have some carbon dioxide waste that your cells have been making. And that waste actually then gets thrown back into the alveoli."
Health,"So now you can see how oxygen gets from the outside world, gets breathed in through the lungs when you inhale, gets down into the alveoli, exchanges with the blood, and then you exhale and let all that carbon dioxide out.."
Health,"Now Jack came across, a long time ago, a famous, now famous beanstalk. So this beanstalk was growing and growing and had these huge leaves. And actually Jack used these leaves to make his way up this beanstalk. And so, this is how this beanstalk became very famous. Because it basically allowed Jack to use it like a ladder. Now the part that we don't hear about is what was going on between Jack and the beanstalk. He was exercising, right? So he was actually making a lot of carbon dioxide."
Health,"He was making a lot of this gas, this carbon dioxide gas, as kind of a waste product as he was running, scampering up the beanstalk. And the beanstalk was helping him physically, but also was actually providing him with very precious oxygen. In fact, if the beanstalk didn't do that, he may not have even made it. And we also, we don't know for sure, but we think that perhaps some of this story may have taken place during the day. And in fact, we know that sunlight is quite important for this process."
Health,"And we think that this process, the name that we give it for the beanstalk anyway, is photosynthesis. And so what is really happening-- we're actually going to kind of write it out here-- between Jack and the beanstalk, and really between all plants and animals? What is this process between them? We know that on the one hand, you have beanstalks doing photosynthesis, and on the other hand, you have folks like Jack doing cellular respiration. And there's this really kind of interesting symbiosis."
Health,"And by that I just mean that the two are kind of relying on each other to really work. So you kind of need both of them to work well. And so let's actually take a moment to write out these processes that are happening between Jack and the beanstalk. So let's start with the process of photosynthesis, the beanstalk. So on the one hand, you've got what? You've got water because, of course, the beanstalk needs water, and you've got carbon dioxide. And I'm going to do carbon oxide in orange."
Health,"So it's taking in water and carbon dioxide. And it's going to put out, it's going to actually take these ingredients if you want to think of it as kind of cooking, it's going to take these ingredients and it's going to put out. It's going to put out what? Oxygen and glucose. So I'll put glucose up top and oxygen down below. So these are the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis. And on the other side, you've got something very similar. You've got inputs. You've got glucose and oxygen going in."
Health,"You're going to start seeing some serious similarities here. You've got glucose and oxygen going in. So Jack is taking in those two things. And he is again, of course, processing them. And he's putting out water and carbon dioxide. So this looks really, really nice, right? Looks perfect actually. Because everything is nice and balanced. And you can see how it makes perfect sense that, not only did Jack need the beanstalk, but actually it sounds like the beanstalk needed Jack, based on how I've drawn it."
Health,"Now remember, none of this would even happen if there was no sunlight. So we actually need light energy. In fact, that's the whole purpose of this, right? Getting energy. So you have to have some light energy. I'm going to put a big plus sign, and I might even circle it because it's so important. I don't want you to lose track of it. And on the other side, of course, Jack is getting something as well. He's getting chemical energy. In fact, he's using the chemical energy to help him climb the beanstalk."
Health,"And so the chemical energy comes in the form of what we call ATP, which is just a molecule of high energy. And so Jack and the beanstalk are basically going from light energy to chemical energy using these two equations. Now here's the part that people don't always appreciate. And I'm actually going to take just a moment to show you that this isn't the full story. There's actually something else going on as well. And that is that there's actually some cellular respiration happening on the plant's side."
Health,"So remember, not only does the human, or the Jack, need energy, but so does the plant. The plant needs energy as well. And in fact, if it takes in light energy right here, it needs to find a way to actually, eventually get some chemical energy itself, so that it can do all the things it needs to do. It doesn't need to run because plants don't move in that sense, but it might need to make new roots, and may need to make a flower, and all these things take energy."
Health,"So actually, photosynthesis is happening during the day, but at all times plants are also capable of doing cellular respiration, just like humans are. So humans and plants have actually more in common than you might think. So, this brings up an obvious question. Why in the world would a plant send its glucose and oxygen this way, when it needs it itself? You know, why would it actually get rid of it? Well, the truth is, that the glucose ends up oftentimes in fruits and vegetables that we eat."
Health,"But as far as the oxygen goes, it makes an excess of oxygen. So there is actually enough oxygen to go both to us, or to Jack and to be used by itself. So it actually has an excess of oxygen that it's making. So this is actually kind of interesting and good to know. Now if you think about it, if I was to, let's say sketch out a planet. Let's draw a little planet over here, and ask you the question."
Health,"If this was your planet Earth, and you've got thousands, instead of just one Jack, let's say now you have thousands of Jacks and thousands of beanstalks, in fact, not even thousands. Let's say billions, because really, that's what we have. We have a planet full of humans, and full of other animals, and full of plants. What would the atmosphere look like? This is the atmosphere. What would the atmosphere look like? Well you'd guess that the atmosphere is gas."
Health,"And so what would those gases be? Well, the way I've drawn things again, it looks like I've got lots of oxygen and lots of carbon dioxide. So I would say well, I guess there must be, I don't know, maybe 50-50 carbon dioxide and oxygen based on what we know so far. And the truth is, that's actually not true."
Health,"That if you actually look at air, if you actually break down the atmosphere or air-- I'm just going to write ""air"" here-- if you actually break it down, turns out that the ratios are actually a little different. So for example, oxygen makes up about 21% of our air. This is our air breakdown. And carbon dioxide makes up about less than 1%. So, that leaves you wondering, what the heck is making up all that other parts of air? What is it made of? And in truth, it's about 78% nitrogen."
Health,"Now you know, you've got nitrogen in your proteins, we've got nitrogen in our DNA. So nitrogen is part of us and is part of many, many living things. But nitrogen gas, specifically, is actually N2. And N2, this nitrogen gas, really is not too reactive. It kind of just hangs out by itself, does not like to react with things."
Health,"So, looking at our little atmosphere graph, if you want to now think about it, knowing that we've got very little carbon dioxide and about 21% oxygen-- you could think of oxygen being, let's say, something like that-- well then relative to that nitrogen would be much more. You have much more nitrogen hanging out. And so this is really what our atmosphere looks like. It looks more filled with nitrogen than anything else. And in terms of carbon dioxide, it's just got a little smidge of carbon dioxide."
Health,"Maybe right there. That could be carbon dioxide, maybe even less than that. So this is really what our atmosphere looks like, visually. And the nitrogen again, it's making up the majority. And if you actually wonder where all that nitrogen is coming from, because I didn't mention it in any of the equations, most of that nitrogen has been around, scientists think, since the beginning of when earth even had an atmosphere. And that nitrogen, we're just kind of carrying with us at all times."
Health,"And that's why it just remains around 78%, and will probably remain there for many, many years to come.."
Health,"But already, there are going to be some differences. So for example, you have in your nose, these little yellow nose hairs, and the first question, of course, people think of with nose hairs is what the heck is their purpose? What do they do? And nose hairs are part of our filter system, so we have this great filter system and there's nose hair, and their job is to make sure that all of the kind of large particles of dirt and dust are kind of picked up."
Health,So they're good for getting all the large particles out of the air so it's cleaned up.
Health,"Then you also have this green slime, right? this kind of green mucus that we all kind of make, and this mucus sometimes, you think of it as snot, this snot or mucus is good for small particles, because it's really sticky, and this small particles of dust and dirt are going to glom onto it, and so that is our way of kind of cleaning up the air so that when we breathe in through our nose, the air is basically clean or at least cleaner than it would be otherwise."
Health,"And so of course, if you compared nose air or the air that you breathe in through your nose to air that you breathe in through your mouth, the mouth air will be, of course a little dirtier, because they didn't have that nice filter system. And kind of thinking along the same route, if you think about picking your nose, that would be basically kind of cleaning the filter, right? So that's kind of a new way maybe of thinking about that habit. So air is going to end up going to the back of the throat."
Health,"So air is going to kind of go in this way, and a little molecule of oxygen is going to kind of end up at the back of the throat. And another kind of interesting difference is that already, that oxygen molecule and the air around it is going to be slightly different in other ways. It's going to be cleaner if it went through the nose, but either way, nose or mouth, it's going to be warmer and also more moist. So that's another change. In comparison, on the outside, the air is a little colder and drier."
Health,"So these are some key differences in terms of what's happening to the air. These are two major differences, right? So now the air or little molecule of oxygen has got a choice. It can either go kind of down one of two paths. One, I'm going to draw is going to be into the larynx. This is our larynx right here. And we also call our larynx our voice box, so you might remember that was the name I had mentioned previously, voice box, or larynx, is kind of the more medical word, I guess."
Health,"And sitting over the larynx is the epiglottis. And the epiglottis is basically like a lid kind of protecting the larynx from making sure that food and water don't go into it. Now, there's another tube I just alluded to, and it's sitting right here, and this purple tube, is our esophagus So the esophagus is basically, it's fantastic for things like food and water. You want food and water to go down the esophagus because it's going to lead to the stomach."
Health,"So you want food and water to go that way, but you don't want food and water to go into the larynx. And so you want to make sure that the epiglottis, that lid, is working really well. And if you're swallowing food and water, this epiglottis will literally just kind of close up and protect your larynx. But in this case, that's not happening. We're not actually food and water, we're a little molecule of oxygen, so let's follow that molecule a little bit further down. Let's see what happens to it."
Health,"I'm going to drag up the canvas a little bit. Let's make a little bit of space, and I want to just stop it right there because I want to show you that the air molecule, the oxygen molecule has already kind of made an interesting crossroads. It's actually kind of broken an important boundary, and that's this boundary right here."
Health,"And on the top of this boundary, I've included the larynx and of course, all the other stuff we just talked about-- the mouth and the nose-- and this is considered our upper respiratory tract. So anything above this dashed line is our upper respiratory tract, and then, of course, you can then guess that anything below the line must then be our lower respiratory tract."
Health,"So this is an important boundary because people will talk about the upper and lower tract, and I want to make sure you know what is on which side. So on the top of it, is the larynx and everything above that, and below it is the trachea. Let me label that here. The trachea is right here, the wind pipe or the trachea, and everything below that, which, of course, mainly includes things like the lungs, but as we'll see a few other structures that we're going to name."
Health,"So I'm going to keep moving down, but now you know that important boundary exists. So now let me just make a little bit more space you can see the entire lungs. You can see the molecule is going to go through the trachea, and actually, I have my left lung incompletely drawn. Let me just finish it off right there."
Health,"So we have our right and left lung, right? These are the two lungs, and our air is going to just kind of slowly pass down-- our molecule of oxygen is going to pass down, and it's going to go either into the right lung or the left lung. Now here, I want to make sure I just take a quick pause and show you the naming structure."
Health,"And the important word of the day is the bronchi, which alludes to one, or-- sorry, I screwed it up already-- the bronchi, which alludes to more than one-- sorry about that-- and bronchus, which alludes to one. So bronchi means more than one and bronchus means one. So just keep track of these letters, I and U-S. So if we say that, for example, we are going into this area right here. Let me just choose a new color so it's really clear. This will be our main."
Health,"If we go into this spot-- let's say our air molecule or our oxygen molecule goes this way-- then we would say it's in our left main-- I'm just going to underline as I go-- left main bronchus. That's what we'd call that. And then if it went further, let's say it went down here, then instead of calling it main, I would call it the lobar. That's the word here. So I'd say it's my left lobar bronchus. And then if I wanted to go a little bit further, I could say well now this is my segmental, segmental."
Health,"So these are the words that we use, and this final one would be then my left segmental bronchus. And of course, if we want to talk about two of them, let's say I want to talk about both this guy and this guy, then I would say those are my right segmental bronchi, because now I have to use the top word because it's plural. So that's the naming structure. And another kind of important naming structure you'll sometimes see is primary bronchus, secondary bronchus, and segmental, they call tertiary bronchus."
Health,"So you'll see either one of those, but I'm going to stick to main, lobar, and segmental because I think it's a little bit easier and more intuitive to remember it that way. Now, there are a couple of important, interesting things happening already. So right here, this notch or this point right here, this is our carina. This is our carina. So at the carina, you have your break between the right and left main bronchus. And what I want to point out to you is that this is a little bit more vertical."
Health,"This right-sided one is a little bit more vertical, and the left-sided one is a little bit more lateral. This is a little bit more flat, or lateral. So it's kind of a cool thing to know, which is that if something was to slide down the throat, let's say a penny or a peanut or something was to slide down here, it's more likely to go down this way simply because of gravity."
Health,"So gravity is going to push things towards the right main bronchus more than the left main bronchus because the right main bronchus is a little bit more vertical. This is kind of a fun fact that you now know. And actually, I guess I didn't do this already, but we should actually take a break and make sure we name some of these things. Remember this is called our cardiac notch, and remember that's one clue to kind of telling apart the left and right lung."
Health,"And the other clue we said was the lobes, so of course, the right one has the upper lobe, the middle lobe, and the lower lobe, and the left lung only has the upper and lower. So that's an important clue. I just want to make sure we don't forget our little tricks that we've learned for telling apart the lungs. So I'm going to take a little pause there, and now, I'm going to show you in a sped up version all of the different branch points."
Health,"So for example, here we have just a couple of branch points, one, two, and getting into this segmental bronchi would be the third branch point. But I'm going to speed things along and show you how many more branch points there actually are before we get to the final part of our lung where the gas exchange actually happens, so enjoy."
Health,"[MUSIC - NIKOLAI RIMSKY-KORSAKOV, ""FLIGHT OF THE BUMBLEBEE""] Going back to the very point where we left off, we start with kind of a bronchi, and we said that there is a naming structure for how to name the bronchi, but that's really just the first three branches. And then after the first three branches, all of the orange stuff, all those branches going from branch point 4 all the way down to about branch point 20, those are the conducting bronchioles. So that's the name we give them."
Health,"They're no longer bronchi, they're bronchioles. And so if you see that word just keep that in mind, that we're a little bit further along in the lungs. And then after the conducting bronchioles, you get into a few more branch points, and we call them the respiratory bronchioles. And actually the final I should mention this the final conducting bronchiole, sometimes you'll see this called the terminal bronchiole."
Health,"It's that kind of a bad name because terminal sounds like we're done, but actually we're just done with the conducting bronchioles, and we're still kind of going into the respiratory bronchioles. I guess if I'm only point to one, I should just probably make it singular. And then finally, we get into the alveolar ducts and the alveolar sac, which is kind of a few alveoli put together. And if it's plural as alveoli, then singular just talking about one little part of that sac would be alveolus."
Health,"So that's where our little molecule of oxygen ends up, and this is kind of where it ends up before it's going to participate in gas exchange. Now, this entire area, going from respiratory bronchioles on downwards, this is all called the respiratory zone, and anything above that is considered the conducting zone, so anything above that. And that really includes not just the connecting bronchioles, but conducting bronchioles, and then all the stuff above it."
Health,"So all the bronchi and even the larynx and the mouth and the throat, that's all considered part of the conducting zone. So basically, oxygen is going to come in through the entire conducting zone, everything we just talked about, and it's going to go down into the respiratory zone, and finally our little molecule of oxygen is going to be very happy to finally have made it to the very end of the bronchial tree and is ready for gas exchange now.."
Health,"So I've got my jar here. And I'm actually going to put a little opening on my jar. So let's say there's a little opening there. And I take that opening, and I'm going to just make it kind of a stretched-out neck. So this is my stretched-out neck on my jar. And there's the opening to my jar. And on the other side, what I want to do is actually kind of compare what's going on inside of my jar to what's going on outside of the jar."
Health,"So to make it fair, let me actually try to create a purple box-- kind of a dashed line around an equivalent volume. So this is going to be, basically, a similarly-sized part of the air. And of course, this dashed line is just to show you which part I'm talking about, because, of course, this is an imaginary line. But let's say we're comparing what's going on inside of my blue jar with what's going on inside of this purple dashed line."
Health,"Now, we know that that purple dashed line is kind of capturing a certain amount of the air in the atmosphere. And that air is going to have molecules that are bouncing off of each other. Let's say something like this. And you've got a bunch of random collisions happening. And these collisions-- the more frequently the collisions are happening, the higher the pressure in the air. And in fact, measured pressure in the air is around 760 millimeters of mercury. So that's how we think about air pressure."
Health,"So that's the pressure in the atmosphere. And if I was to measure my jar pressure, it would be, of course, the same thing. It would be 760 millimeters of mercury. And as a quick aside, just thinking about what these molecules are, if there are five of them, then you might say that this is nitrogen, this one is nitrogen, this one is nitrogen, this could be nitrogen, and this one might be oxygen. Because remember, oxygen is about 21% of air."
Health,"And so that might be a fair estimation of what these five molecules could be-- mostly nitrogen. So in the air, we've got nitrogen and oxygen. It's bouncing around in my jar, just as it is in the atmosphere itself. And now let's say I decide to do kind of an interesting experiment. I decide to drop the floor-- just stay with me here-- I drop the floor of my jar. So I actually expand the bottom of my jar. For the moment, don't worry so much about how that could possibly happen."
Health,"Let's just assume that I do creatively somehow kind of drop the floor. And now it looks a little bit lower. So the volume has gone up in my jar. And actually, simultaneously, I should mention-- I just want to mention here that this door, or opening, of my jar is closed at the moment. So my opening, I've put a lid on it. So that's closed, and my floor just got a little bit lower. So the volume has gone up. That's the big change, right? Actually, let me write that up here in the corner."
Health,"I'm just going to erase some of these molecules to create some space. And the first thing I want to mention is that the volume has gone up in my jar. So all of the green stuff I write in the corner is going to be from the jar's perspective. If the volume goes up now-- if that's the case, then these molecules inside the jar, they're excited. They've got more room to kind of run around and play and not bump into each other."
Health,"So if they're not bumping into each other as much-- because of course, they've got all this extra space down here-- then the pressure on the inside of the jar is going to go down, right? Because there are less collisions happening. So now we've got, let's say, a slight decrease. It went to 757. So a little bit less than what's on the outside. So because the volume went up, the pressure went down. And again, that's because you have fewer collisions. And the new pressure is 757, which is a positive number."
Health,"But sometimes people refer to this as negative pressure, or a vacuum. And the reason they're saying that is because they're saying, well, relative to 760, relative to this number, 757 is 3 points lower. And so in that sense, it's negative. So if you actually want to compare them to each other, you'd say, well, 757 minus 760 is negative 3. And that would be a negative number. But for the time being, I'm just going to leave it in the numbers we have, which is 757. Now, let's say that I open this door."
Health,"This opening is now open. If I open up this opening, what will happen? Well, we have all this extra space down here I circled, but I'm just going to remove this for the time being-- all this extra space. And molecules, of course, are being knocked around all the time. So these collisions are happening always. And some molecules are going to get knocked perfectly so that they actually move into the jar. Let's say it goes in like this. So you're going to get some molecules that go in."
Health,"And in fact, you might have some molecules that get knocked right out. So it's going to happen constantly. But overall, what's going to be the net difference? Well, let's say I leave this and I walk away and do my own thing for a minute and come back. I'm going to notice that there are actually extra molecules on the inside of my jar, because there's more space, less crowding in my jar because of all that extra volume I created. So over time, there's going to be a few extra molecules in my jar."
Health,"And maybe I got lucky, and this one's an oxygen molecule. So I've got extra molecules on the inside. And these molecules-- so actually, that would be, I guess, the next step, is that air molecules move in. And these molecules are now going to do what molecules do, which is kind of bounce off of each other. So they start bouncing off of each other. And all of a sudden, now you've got-- let's say this guy collides over here as well, and maybe there's some bouncing and this collides over here."
Health,"So now you've got-- because you've got six molecules on the inside and the same volume, the pressure on the inside has gone up. So pressure has gone up on the inside of the jar, simply because there are more molecules in there now. So even though you had more volume initially, you've kind of filled it up with more molecules. So the pressure goes up, let's say to 760 millimeters of mercury. So now it's gone back up. So this is my new pressure."
Health,"And this all happened-- this whole kind of series of events happened because I decided to move the floor. Now, what would happen if I decide to move it back? Let's say I decide to go back to the original floor size. And I get rid of this lower line, and I raise the floor back up. And so now it looks something like this. Well, now the volume-- this is kind of the new first step, what's going to happen. The volume has gone down. That's obvious, because I just moved the floor purposefully."
Health,"And I've got six molecules in my jar. And they're thrashing around, bumping into each other. But they've got less space to do it in. So the pressure is going to go up because there are more collisions. They're bumping into each other more. So the pressure is going to go up. Pressure is going to go up now to, let's say, 763 millimeters of mercury. Because it was 760. And at this point, let's say this is closed up. And so the pressure on the inside is 763 millimeters of mercury. Let me erase this."
Health,"And that's because, again, you have more molecules, but you reduced the volume. So then the pressure on the inside is actually now higher than the outside pressure. I mean, the outside pressure is always going to be around 760. And that's because the atmosphere is just enormous, right? So the movement of a few molecules this way or that way is really not going to change the amount of collisions that are happening in the atmosphere. That's always going to stay the same."
Health,"And so if I was to open this up-- open this door up-- then some molecules, of course, are going to be bouncing around, bouncing around. And some of these things might kind of bounce out. So some molecules might kind of bounce out. And overall, again, on the whole, you're going to have more molecules bouncing out than bouncing in because you have more collisions happening on the inside. And, again, when I say more collisions, in your mind, I want you to think of higher pressure."
Health,"So if there's higher pressure on the inside and more collisions happening on the inside, you're going to have more things bouncing off each other, and molecules are going to be sent outside. So the next step I could write in would be air molecules. Air molecules move out. So the final point is that if air molecules are moving out-- let's say just by random chance, this oxygen molecule happened to be the one that got sent away. So this one kind of got knocked out."
Health,"Then you have-- let me try to erase all this to clear it up-- then you have five molecules, again, on the inside. And you have the same volume that we initially started out with. So the pressure on the inside goes back to what it was in the first place. The pressure falls to 760. And the reason that I say exactly 760 is because this process in step three will continue until the number of collisions on the inside and outside of the jar are equal."
Health,"So this is kind of the process-- and actually, I forgot to mention. When we were back at 763, sometimes people call this positive pressure for the same reason they called it negative before. Because all they're doing is they're comparing 763 to atmospheric pressure, which is 760, and saying, wow, that's a plus 3. That's a little bit positive."
Health,"And so when you compare things relatively, you use words like ""positive"" and ""negative."" But if you're using just the total number in kind of absolute terms, then you would stick to 757 or 763. Now, what does all of this has to do with us? What does a jar and an opening have to do with human beings? Well, let me just show you that by simply changing my drawing a little bit, you'll see what this has to do with us."
Health,"Now, instead of having all the molecules inside the jar-- I know that you know that they're there-- I can actually erase all this. And maybe I can change the shape of this a little bit to help you see what this could be. So let's say I make that like this and start drawing in like that. I'm going to keep all of this kind of the same in terms of the way it looks. Maybe like that. And you can see now, instead of a jar, what I'm creating for you are a pair of lungs. So this is a pair of lungs, left and right."
Health,"This'll be right and this'll be left. And it'll look something like this. And this one might go up like that around that cardiac notch, and go like this. And then we have, of course, the opening-- which, if instead of calling it an opening, I can call it a mouth, this would be my mouth. And I could erase the word ""opening"" completely. And I think you'll start seeing how this is basically what happens in our body. So our head represents the opening of this. And this could be the nose."
Health,"And this could be the head-- kind of a flat head I've drawn here. But you get the idea, I think. So there's your nose and there's your ear. And basically, air is coming in the mouth and going into the lungs and back out of the lungs. And what we call this process is ""inhalation."" So when you increase the volume, we call this ""inhaling."" So if you've ever wondered exactly what happens when you inhale air, there it is."
Health,"And when you close up the lungs and air molecules move out, we call that ""exhaling."" Actually, I should probably try to make it look the same. They're both equally important. So I'll draw them the same way. Exhaling. And now you can see how inhaling and exhaling happen. So with every breath, this is the process. You kind of subtly change the volume, and all of a sudden, the pressure changes. Air moves in and out.."
Health,"And let me begin by telling you that in the middle of your chest, you have this enormous kind of bone that goes down. And I'm drawing it out of proportion just to make it very clear where this bone is. But you can go ahead and feel on your own body this bone, which we call either the breastbone, or the more technical name is the sternum. So I'll write that down here. The sternum is this middle bone, and all the ribs on both sides attach there. So you've got a total of 12 ribs and seven pairs of them."
Health,"Actually, I should say 12 pairs of ribs. I don't want you to think there are 12 total. We actually have 24 total and seven pairs of the ribs. So 14 ribs actually attach directly to this sternum bone. So in white, these are the ribs. And between the ribs, you actually have muscle. So I'm going to draw in some of these muscles between the ribs. And these muscles are all going to have their own nerve that allows them to contract."
Health,"So these muscles are controlled by your brain, and their name-- let me just jot down here on the side-- is intercostal muscle. And inter just means between, so this is the name of the muscle. And costal refers to the ribs. So when you see that word costal, you'll know we're talking about the ribs. So what's between the ribs is these muscles, intercostal muscles. And they are going to start moving outwards when your brain says, hey, I want to take a deep breath. So these muscles are going to contract."
Health,"The ribs, I should say, are going to move outwards. So these go out. And you also have-- let me just make a little bit of space on this canvas-- another muscle that kind of rides down here and has kind of an upside down U shape to it. So I'm drawing it kind of like a dome. You can think of it as a dome. And this dome is the floor-- if you remember, we talked about the floor of the thorax. So this is, of course, our diaphragm muscle. So we've got our diaphragm muscle."
Health,"And this one when it contracts, instead of going out, it's going to go down. So it's going to kind of flatten out. And I can actually draw this. If you can now just stick with me for a moment, I'm going to erase this dome-like shape. And I'm going to draw what it looks like as it contracts. So when it contracts, it's actually going to be more flat. And this flat diaphragm, as you can see, is now further down than it used to be."
Health,"And as it goes down, all of the structures that are inside this space-- so the two lungs. And of course, I didn't draw the heart here. But the heart would be kind of in this cardiac notch. If you want, maybe I could even draw that heart here. They're all going to kind of physically move down. So this is our heart and our lungs. They're physically going to be kind of drawn downwards and out. They are going to also move out as the intercostal muscles move So you have expansion of these lungs."
Health,"That's basically the idea. And if you were to kind of zoom in on this to kind of see exactly what this expansion looks like, when I say you have more volume in the lungs, really what I should be saying, if I wanted to be more exact, is that all the alveoli-- if these are the alveoli, let's say this is another branch. And this is another alveoli right here. All these alveoli, they are actually expanding. And you have about 500 million alveoli. If you can just kind of fathom how big a number that is."
Health,"It's an enormous number of alveoli. And if I was actually drawing them, I would be here drawing forever. It would take forever to write out this many different alveoli. But basically what happens is that when the ribs go out and the diaphragm moves down, these alveoli are actually being pulled out. They're actually being pulled outwards, so they are actually going to be getting larger in size. They literally look like they've grown in size, and this is what they look like."
Health,"And actually, if you were to take an even closer look, you'd see that these alveoli have around them a bunch of protein. The cells around them have a bunch of protein, and this protein is called elastin. And you can guess what elastin might do. It has kind of a similar sound to the word elastic. And elastin is basically kind of like a rubber band, so you can kind of think of elastin as a rubber band."
Health,"And when the muscles move down and out and the alveoli are pulled open-- let me actually now scroll up, because you can kind of go back to the idea of inhaling-- what is happening, then? Well, you have a couple things happening. One, you have muscles-- I'll just write muscles contracting. And when I say muscles, you know I'm talking about all those intercostal muscles in your diaphragm. And as a result of the muscles contracting, you have now the alveoli are stretched open."
Health,"So those rubber bands, those elastin proteins, are literally physically being stretched opened. And keep that in mind, because what's going to happen then is when the muscles relax, which is what happens when you exhale, what do you think is going to happen to that elastin? Well, if it's like a rubber band, if that's what I'm saying it's going to be like, then the alveoli are going to recoil. And that's actually the driving force for why the volume goes back down."
Health,"So if you have a bunch of rubber bands that you're stretching out-- let me actually bring up the picture. You'll see it really clearly. If you're physically kind of using your muscles to help pull this stuff open, then the moment that you stop pulling open, the moment that you stop contracting those muscles now that you have a nice big volume, what's going to happen? Well, all these elastin molecules are going to snap back. Let me do it with a different color. Let's do this color."
Health,"They're going to snap back like this. All that protein is going to want to snap back into the original size. And when they do, this thing gets smaller. So my alveoli goes back to its original size, which was much smaller than this. Let me actually just quickly show that and show you that even though contraction is what opened up things, it's the recoil that brings things back down to their normal size. And let me erase this to make it kind of a neater drawing. So you can see it now."
Health,"Inhaling, the way that we actually increase the volume, is by pulling things open through contraction. And this actually requires energy. Remember, you can't contract a muscle without spending chemical energy. So this takes chemical energy, and we usually think of this molecule ATP as the specific type of chemical energy we're going to use. And to exhale, when you reduce the volume, it's going to be driven by this elastic recoil. So that's a type of elastic potential energy."
Health,"So this process of inhaling and exhaling is really a little different from each other. On the one hand, you're using ATP. You're actually burning through these molecules. And then when you exhale, you're actually not using chemical energy anymore. You're just using that elastic potential energy, kind of the same sort of energy that you can imagine you would have if you snap a rubber band. So let's stop there, and we'll pick up in the next video.."
Health,"See if you could come up with a reason. It turns out that the main reason that dogs pant is so they don't overheat. Let's take a look at how that works. Let's say here we've got our favorite little puppy and it's just been running around for an hour and it's panting and it's got it's tongue lolling out like they do. What's going to happen when that dog breathes is it's going to breathe in cool, outside air."
Health,"Let's say on that day it happened to be 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it's going to breathe out hot air because the air that it breathed in is going to equilibrate with its body. If you don't believe me, put up a hand to your mouth as your breathe out and feel how hot the air is that you're breathing out. What this means is that the dog is expelling heat everytime it breathes because it's taking in something cool and putting out something hot and that heat has to come from somewhere."
Health,"For dogs this is really important because they can't sweat. They have fur coats and they couldn't very well soak those fur coats and sweat everytime they want to lose heat. This is really their best way of getting rid of heat. Now, we humans - and I'm going to try to draw one of we humans over here - we humans can sweat. This is a human with an Afro, apparently. We humans can sweat and so this method of losing heat by breathing heavily is definitely less important for us, but it actually still happens."
Health,"Just like the dog when we breathe in, or when the air that we breathe in, which technically comes from both the nose and the mouth, that air goes into our lungs and in our lungs and in our lungs it divides into all those little alveoli that you've heard about that have a huge amount of surface area. Let's me just draw a couple of them here."
Health,"All these tiny alveoli have a huge amount of surface area and that allows all this cool air that you breathe in, which I'm drawing here, to equilibrate with the temperature of the blood that's passing by these capillaries. So just like the dog, when we breathe in air that's let's say 70 degrees Celsius, we're going to breathe out air that's pretty much body temperature. That should not be Celsius, that should be Fahrenheit."
Health,"When we breathe an air that's 70 or maybe cooler, we are going to breathe out air that's body temperature. If this guy is not having a fever that would be about 98.6 degrees Farenheit. Therefore, we can see that getting rid of extra heat is another thing that the lungs can do. We have a fancy word for this. We call it Thermo, thermo meaning heat just like a thermometer measures temperature, Thermoregulation. So you could say it's regulation of the temperature of our bodies."
Health,"That's another things that the lungs can do. Lungs can thermoregulate. You'll note that this is kind of convenient because times when you might be overheating, just like this dog, times when you might be overheating or when you've done a lot of exercise and when you've done all that exercise you need a lot of oxygen to feed your muscles and at the same time you want to get rid of heat."
Health,"These two functions of providing oxygen and getting rid of excess heat coincide nicely in the case of exercise because what happens when you exercise is that you start breathing really heavily. At rest, you might be breathing about five liters of air per minute."
Health,"Meaning that a total of five liters of air is coming in and out of your lungs every minute, but while you're doing exercise, let's say heavy exercise, let's say you're running a mile, trying to get a really good time, you can easily go up to 50 liters per minute and clearly, that is a lot more, 10 times more. What that means is you're going to be putting out 10 times more heat through your lungs than when you're resting."
Health,So it's convenient that when you exercise you get more oxygen by breathing heavily and you also get rid of more heat by breathing heavily..
Health,"And that through the process of respiration, we break down those sugars and we release carbon dioxide. So in this video, what I want to do is take a big step back and think about how we actually get our oxygen into our body and how we release it back out into the atmosphere. Another way to think about it is how we ventilate ourselves. How do we get the oxygen in, and how do we get the carbon dioxide out? And I think any of us could at least start off this video."
Health,"It starts off in either our nose or our mouth. I always have a clogged sinus so I often have to deal with my mouth. I sleep with my mouth often. But it always starts in our nose or our mouths. Let me draw someone with a nose and a mouth. So let's say that this is my person. Maybe his mouth will be open so that he can breathe. His eyes aren't important, but just so you know it's a person. So this is my test subject or the person I'm going to use to diagram. That's his ear."
Health,"Maybe he has a bit of a-- let's give him some hair. All of that is irrelevant, but this is our guy. This is the guy that's going to show us how we take air in and how we take air out of the body. So let's go inside of this guy. I can draw his outside first. Let me see how well I can do this. So this is outside the guy. That doesn't look right. Let's say the guy looks something like this and he's got-- this is his shoulders. That's our guy. All right."
Health,"So in our mouth, we have our oral cavity right there, which is just the space that our mouth creates. We have our oral cavity. I could draw our tongue and all of that and maybe I will. Maybe I'll draw the tongue. But you have this space inside of the mouth-- call that the oral cavity. Oral for mouth, cavity for space, or hole, or opening. And then also you have your nostrils and they open up into a nasal cavity. So that's another big space just like this."
Health,"And we know that they connect at the back of our nose or the back of our mouth. And this passage right here where they connect is called the pharynx. When your air goes through your nose-- they say breathing through your nose is better, probably because it gets filtered by your nose hairs and it gets warmed up and and what not, but you can breathe through either side."
Health,"The air goes in through either your nasal cavity or your oral cavity and then comes back through your pharynx and then the pharynx splits into two pipes. One for-- well, one, air can go down either one, but the other one is for food. So your pharynx gets split. In the back you have your esophagus-- and we'll talk more about the esophagus in a future video. In the back you have your esophagus and in the front-- let me draw a little dividing line there."
Health,"In the front, maybe this-- let me make it connect like that. I was using yellow. I'm going to use yellow to continue and I'm going to use green for the air. So it divides just like that. So behind your air pipe, you have your esophagus. Let me make that another color. And then right here is your larynx. And I'm going to concern ourselves with the larynx. Esophagus is where your food goes down. We know that we eat food with our mouth as well. So this is where we want our food to go-- down the esophagus."
Health,"But the focus of this video is our ventilation. What do we do with our air? So I'm going to focus as the air goes through our larynx. And the larynx is also our voicebox. So as you hear me talking right now, there are these little things right about here that are vibrating at just the right frequencies and I'm able to shape the sound with my mouth to make this video. So that's also your voicebox, but I won't focus on that right now."
Health,"It's called a voicebox because of this whole anatomical structure that looks something like that. But then after the air passes through the larynx-- this is on the way in-- it goes to the trachea, which is essentially just the pipe for air. The esophagus is the pipe for food. Let me write this down. And then from the trachea-- and the trachea is actually a reasonably rigid structure. It has cartilage around it and it makes sense that it has cartilage."
Health,"You don't want-- you can imagine a hose-- if it bent a lot, you wouldn't be able to get a lot of water through it, or a lot of air through it. So you don't want this thing to bend a lot. So that's why it needs to have some rigidity-- so that's why it has cartilage around it. And then it splits into two tubes-- and I think you know where these two tubes are going to. And I'm not drawing this in super detail."
Health,"I just want you to get the idea of them, but these two tubes are the bronchi-- or each one is a bronchus. And they also have cartilage, so they're fairly rigid, but the bronchi keep splitting. They keep splitting into smaller and smaller tubes just like that and at some point, they stop having cartilage. They stop being reasonably rigid, but they keep splitting off. So I'll just draw them as these little lines. At some point they become such thin things. They just keep splitting off."
Health,"So the air just keeps splitting off and spread and goes down the different paths. And when the bronchi no longer have cartilage around them, they're no longer rigid. The first of those are called-- or actually all the tubes after that point are called bronchioles. These are bronchioles. So for example, that we could call a bronchiole. And there's nothing fancy here. It's just a pipe that just gets thinner and thinner and thinner."
Health,"We've labeled the different parts of the pipes different things, but the idea is, let's take it through our mouth or our nose and we just keep dividing and keep dividing this main division into two different paths that takes us into each of our lungs. Let me draw this guy's lungs here. And these bronchi-- or the bronchi split into the lungs-- the bronchioles are in the lungs and eventually the bronchioles terminate. And this is where it gets interesting."
Health,"They keep dividing smaller and smaller, thinner and thinner and thinner, into these little air sacs, just like that. At the end of every super small bronchiole are these little air sacs-- super small air sacs-- and I'm going to talk about these air sacs in a second. And these are called alveoli. So I've used a lot of fancy words, but the general idea is simple. Air comes in through a pipe. The pipe gets thinner and thinner and thinner and they end up at these little air sacs."
Health,"And you're saying, well, how does that get the oxygen into my system? Well, the key here is that these air sacs are super small and have very, very, very thin walls-- or I guess thin membranes. So let me zoom in. So if I were to zoom in on one of these alveoli-- and just to give you an idea, these are super duper duper small. I've drawn them fairly large here, but each alveoli-- let me draw a little bit bigger. Let me draw these air sacs. So you have these air sacs like this."
Health,"And then you have a bronchiole that's terminating in that air sac. Maybe a bronchiole is terminating in another air sac just like that-- another set of air sacs just like that. Each of these are only 200 to 300 microns in diameter. So that distance right there-- let me switch colors-- that distance right there is 200 to 300 microns. And in case you don't know what a micron is, a micron is a millionth of a meter-- or you can view it as a thousandth of a millimeter."
Health,"So this is 200 thousandths of a millimeter. Or you can think of them as-- and this is actually a very easy way to visualize it-- this is about one fifth of a millimeter. So if I actually try to draw it on the screen-- if you made this full screen, a millimeter is about that far. Maybe a little farther than that. Maybe about that far. So imagine a fifth of that and that's what we're talking about the diameter of one of these things."
Health,"And just to put it in the whole scheme relative to cells, the average cell in the human body is about 10 microns. So this is only about 20 or 30 cells in diameter or relative to the average cell in the human body. So these have a super thin membrane. If you view them as balloons, the balloon is very thin-- pretty much one cell thick and they're connected to the bloodflow-- or actually, a better way to think about is that our circulatory system passes right next to each of these things."
Health,"So you have blood vessels that come from the heart and they want to be oxygenated. In general, the blood vessels that don't have oxygen-- and I'm going to do this in a lot more detail when I make the videos about the heart and our circulation system-- the blood vessels that don't have oxygen-- de-oxygenated blood is a little bit darker. It looks a little bit purplish. So I'll draw it as blue. So these are vessels that are coming from the heart."
Health,So this blood right here has no oxygen in it or it's been de-oxygenated or it has very little oxygen in it. And the word for the blood vessels that comes from the heart are arteries. Let me write that down. I'll review that again when we cover it in the heart. So arteries are blood vessels from the heart. And you've probably heard of arteries. Vessels that go to the heart are called veins.
Health,"This is really important to keep in mind because later on, you're going to see that arteries don't always carry oxygen or they're always not de-oxygenated and veins always aren't one way or the other. We're going to go into a lot more detail when we actually cover the heart and the circulatory system, but just remember, arteries go away. Veins go to the heart."
Health,"So here, these are arteries going away from the heart to the lungs, to the alveoli because they want the blood that's traveling in them to get oxygen. So what's going to happen is that the air is flowing through the bronchioles and circulating around the alveoli, filling the alveoli-- and as they fill the alveoli, the little molecules of oxygen are allowed to cross the membrane of the alveoli and essentially be absorbed into the blood."
Health,"I'll do a lot more on that when we talk about hemoglobin and red blood cells, but you just have to realize that there's just a lot of capillaries. Capillaries are just super small blood vessels that allow air to pass-- essentially oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules to pass between them. These have a lot of capillaries on them that allow the exchange of gases. So the oxygen can go into this blood and so once the oxygen-- so this is the vessel that's coming from the heart and then it's just a tube."
Health,"So then once it gets the oxygen, it's going to go back to the heart. And so essentially this is the point where this vessel, this pipe, part of our circulatory system, goes from being an artery-- because it's coming from the heart-- to a vein because it's going back to the heart. And there's a special word for these arteries and veins. They're called pulmonary arteries and veins. So going away from the heart to the lungs, to the alveoli, these are the pulmonary arteries."
Health,"And going back to the heart are the pulmonary veins. Now you're saying, Sal, what does pulmonary mean? Well, pulmo comes from the Latin for the lungs. It literally means the arteries that are of the lungs or that go to the lungs and the veins that come from the lungs. So anytime people talk about pulmonary anything, they're talking about our lungs-- or maybe something related to how we breathe. So it's a good word to know."
Health,"So anyway, you have your oxygen coming in through your mouth or your nose, through the pharynx-- it could fill your stomach. We can blow up our stomach like a balloon, but that doesn't help us actually get oxygen to our blood stream. But the oxygen will come through our larynx, into our trachea, through the bronchi, eventually in bronchioles, ending up in alveoli and being able to be absorbed into what where the arteries, but then we're going to go back and then essentially oxygenate the blood."
Health,"The red blood cells become red once the hemoglobin becomes very red or scarlet once it actually has the oxygen and then we go back. But at the same time, this isn't just about getting oxygen into our arteries or onto the hemoglobin. It's also about releasing carbon dioxide. So these blue arteries coming from the lungs are also going to release carbon dioxide into the alveoli. And these will be exhaled. So we have oxygen coming in."
Health,"Other things will be coming in, but the O2 is what gets absorbed in the alveoli. And then when we breathe out, we're going to have carbon dioxide that was in our blood, but then it gets absorbed into the alveoli and they get squeezed out. I'm going to tell you in a second how it gets squeezed. It's actually that squeezing out that actually-- when the air goes back out, it can vibrate my vocal cords and it'll allow me to talk, but I'm not going to go into too much detail about that."
Health,"So the last thing to consider about this whole pulmonary system or about our lungs is, how does it force the air in and how does it force the air out? And the way it's done is really kind of like a-- you could imagine it's kind of a pump or a balloon-- is that we have this huge layer of flat muscles. Let me pick a good color here. Right below the lungs-- and this is called a thoracic diaphragm. And so when it's relaxed, it kind of has this arch shape, and so the lungs are kind of squeezed in."
Health,"They don't have a lot of volume. But when I essentially breathe in, what's happening is this thoracic diaphragm is contracted and when it's contracted, it gets shorter, but more importantly, it opens up the space where my lungs are. So my lungs can fill up that space. So what it does is, it essentially-- it's like pulling a balloon larger, making the volume of my lungs larger."
Health,"And when you make the volume of something larger-- so the lungs will become larger as my thoracic diaphragm is contracted and it kind of arches down, creates more space-- and as the volume of something becomes larger, the pressure inside of them goes down. If you remember from physics, the pressure times volume is a constant. So when we breathe in, our brain is essentially telling our diaphragm to contract. We have more space around our lungs. Our lungs expand to fill the space."
Health,"We have less pressure here than we have outside-- or you can view it as negative pressure. So air always wants to go from high pressure to low pressure and so air is going to flow into our lungs. And hopefully there'll be some oxygen there that can then essentially go into our alveoli and end up in our arteries and then go back in the veins as oxygen attached to hemoglobin. I'll talk more about that in detail. And then when we stop contracting the diaphragm, it goes back to this arched position."
Health,"It contracts. It's kind of like a rubber band. It contracts back the lungs and it essentially expels the air back and now that air's going to have a lot more carbon dioxide. And just to get a sense of-- I can look at my lungs-- I can't look at them, but they don't seem too large."
Health,"How do I get enough oxygen in them-- and the key is, is that because of this branching process and the alveoli, the inside surface area of the lungs are actually much larger than you can imagine-- or actually than I could have imagined had someone not told me. So it actually turns out-- I looked it up-- the internal surface area of your alveoli-- so the total surface area where the oxygen can be absorbed in or the carbon dioxide can be absorbed out from the blood-- it's actually 75 square meters."
Health,"That's meters, not feet. If you think about it, that's like a-- imagine some type of a tarp or a field. That's almost nine by nine meters. That's almost 27 by 27 square feet. That's the size of some people's backyards. That's how much surface air you have inside of your lungs. It's all folded up. That's how it gets jammed into what look like relatively small lungs."
Health,"But that's what gives us enough surface area for enough of the air, enough of the oxygen, to cross the alveoli membrane into our blood system and enough of the carbon dioxide to go back in. And just to have a sense of how many alveoli we had-- I told you that they're very small-- we actually have 300 million in each lung. In each lung, we have 300 million alveoli. So anyway, hopefully that gives you a decent sense of how we at least get oxygen into our blood system and carbon dioxide out of it."
Health,"In the next video, I'll talk more about our actual circulatory system and how we get the oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and how do we get the carbon dioxide from the rest of the body into the lungs?."
Health,"But of course, I do as I'm told, and I get my blood drawn. I just try to distract myself when the blood is actually filling that needle. And I usually look away, and before I know it, it's done, right? So it's out of my mind, and I walk out of the office pretty happy, because now I don't have to think about it anymore. But here's what I want to do now is kind of follow the path that this blood takes and think about what happens next, after they draw the blood."
Health,"So the first step is they usually put that blood into a tube. And usually that's done directly, actually. These days, usually that tube is already kind of sitting and waiting, and it's collecting blood immediately. So this is my cap for my tube. And inside my tube, I've got blood. This is my blood filling up this tube. And this is kind of a special tube. And the thing to know about this tube is that on the walls of the tube is a chemical that basically prevents the blood from clotting."
Health,"You don't want the blood to clot, because it's hard to do any sort of lab work on it. And so this tube is very special in that way. It won't actually clot. And so to make sure it's working properly, sometimes people kind of gently shake the tube up a little bit, just to make sure that there's good mixing and so that the blood doesn't clot. Now from there, the blood goes over to the lab. So there's a machine in the lab that takes blood from me. This is my blood."
Health,"But it also takes blood from other people, let's say a few other patients in the hospital that day, or in the clinic. And all of our blood is kind of labeled and put into this machine. And what the machine does is it spins. It basically spins really quickly. So all these tubes, they're attached so they don't fly away. But they basically spin as well. And if all these tubes are spinning, then what it creates is a force called the centrifugal force. So this process is called centrifugation."
Health,"Let me write it out here. Centrifugation. And the machine is called a centrifuge. So it's basically going to spin really quickly, let's say, in one direction or the other. And as a result, what happens is that the blood starts separating out. And the heavy parts of blood kind of go to the tip of the tube. And the less dense part of blood actually rises towards the lid. So after you've centrifuged-- let's say you've actually gone through this process, and you centrifuge the blood."
Health,"Now you have the same tube, but I'm going to show you kind of an after picture. So let's say this was before I actually spun the tube, and now I've got an after. This is my after picture. So after I spin the tube, what does it look like? Let me draw the tube. And the biggest key difference here is that instead of having one similar looking homogeneous liquid, like we had before, now it actually starts looking really different. You've got three different layers, in fact."
Health,"I'm going to draw all three layers for you. So this is the first layer. And this is the most impressive layer. The largest volume of our blood is going to be in this top layer. So remember, this is the least dense, right? It's not very dense, and that's why it stayed near the lid. And it's actually going to make up about 55% of our total volume. And we call it plasma. So if you've ever heard that word plasma, now you know what it means."
Health,"So if I was to take a drop of this stuff-- let's say I took a little drop of this plasma, and I wanted to take a good hard look at what was in my drop-- 90% of plasma is going to be nothing more than water. So that's interesting, right, because the major part of blood is plasma, and the major part of plasma is water. So now you're seeing why it is that we always say, well, make sure you drink a lot of water. Make sure you're hydrated. Because a big part of your blood itself is water."
Health,"And in fact, that's true for the rest of your body as well. But I want to stress that it's true for blood as well. So that leaves the rest, right? We've got 90%, we have to get to 100%. So what is 8% of this plasma made up of? It's protein. And let me give you some examples of this protein. So one would be, for example, albumin. And albumin, if you're not familiar with it, it's an important protein in your plasma that keeps the liquid from kind of leaking away out of the blood vessels."
Health,"Another important protein, the antibody. And this, I'm sure you've heard of, but antibodies are basically involved in your immune system, making sure that you stay nice and healthy and don't get sick with infections. And another part of the protein, another type of protein, to kind of keep in mind, would be fibrinogen. And this is one important protein involved in clotting. And there are actually many other clotting factors, we call them, as well. So I'm just going to put clotting factors here."
Health,"So these are proteins. Things like albumin, antibody, fibrinogen, these are all proteins. Now we've still got 2% to account for. And this is going to be things like hormones, for example. And that could be something like insulin. We've got electrolytes. That could be something like sodium. And we've got, also, nutrients. So nutrients, that could be something, for example, like glucose. So these things all make up your plasma."
Health,"So a lot of the things that we kind of think about, talk about, are all in your plasma. including vitamins and things like that. So now another layer we have right below the plasma, is here in white. And if I was to kind of zoom in on it, it would be a very, very tiny part of blood-- less than 1%. And this is actually white blood cells. This layer contains white blood cells and platelets. So these are cellular parts of our blood."
Health,"And they make up a very tiny bit, but they're a very important part of our blood, of course. Below this layer, so now the most dense layer of blood, would be the red blood cells. So this is this last bit. And this, just to make it add up, would be about 45%. And these red blood cells, of course, contain within them hemoglobin. So sometimes it gets tricky because you forget, you think, oh, protein, so that must be plasma."
Health,"Remember, red blood cells and white blood cells, within them, they have proteins as well. So just remember, they contain lots of protein as well, within them. So, for example, hemoglobin. So this is an example, right? Now one word you may have heard of is serum. So what is serum, exactly? Well, serum, this word, is very, very similar to plasma in terms of what it's made of. In fact, if I was to circle what is in serum, I would circle this bit. Basically everything within my blue line would be circled."
Health,"This is serum. And so the only thing I've left out of serum is fibrinogen and the clotting factors. So plasma and serum you can just remember being very similar. And the exception is that the serum does not include the fibrinogen and clotting factors. Now, looking down at the red blood cells, what can we learn from that? Well, you may have heard this term hematocrit."
Health,"And if this was my blood, if I actually had drawn my blood, as I drew in this picture, and this was my blood, my hematocrit would have been 45%. And all that means is hematocrit equals volume taken up by red blood cells divided by the total volume. So if, in this case, my total volume is 100, my percent, I already told you, is 45%. So that's why I knew my hematocrit was 45%. It's just the percent taken up by your red blood cells."
Health,"And that's an important percent to know, because the red blood cells are the part of blood that are actually carrying the oxygen around. Now to kind of stress this point of hematocrit further and maybe even kind of introduce a couple of new words, let me draw out three little vials of blood. So let's say I have three vials here-- one, two, three. And these are going to be three different people, let's say. But they're all very similar, same age, same gender."
Health,"Because hematocrit, what is normal, is actually going to change depending on whether you're talking about a certain age, a certain gender, even depending on where you live in terms of altitude. Because let's say you live at the top of a mountain, that is going to affect your hematocrit as well. So a lot of things affect hematocrit. But let's say we have three people kind of very similar in those ways. Now the first person, I'm going to draw out their blood here."
Health,"Their plasma, let's say, is taking up this much of their total volume. The second person, their plasma is taking up this much of their total volume. And the third person, their plasma is taking up, let's say, a lot, of their total volume. Let's say all the way down to here. So you spun all three, and this is what you've gotten. Of course, all three still have white blood cells. Got to draw that in. And they have platelets, of course, that's this tiny little layer-- less than 1%, we said."
Health,"And the remainder then has to be red blood cells. So this is the red blood cell layer right here. This is the red blood cell layer. And it's really large here for this second individual. And this third individual, it's actually kind of on the smaller side. Not too much of the volume is taken up by red blood cells. So here, if I was to kind of go through and label these folks, I would say, well, this first person is what I would call normal. The second person has a lot of red blood cells."
Health,"It's so, so predominant. This is a very high percentage, right? I know this is taking up a high amount of the total volume. So this person has what I would call polycythemia. It's just a medical word to say that the volume of red blood cells over the total volume is very high. Or you could say their hematocrit is very high. And this person, this third person, has a very low amount of red blood cell volume relative to the total volume. This is actually pretty low."
Health,"And so this person, I would say, has anemia. So if you've ever heard these terms anemia, or I'm anemic, sometimes people say, or even the word polycythemia, now you know it's just referring to what volume of their blood is taken up by red blood cells.."
Health,"Let me draw a couple of them just so you get the idea. And if you remember from the last video, these are kind of where air goes in through our trachea, then that splits up into our bronchi, and then those split into the bronchioles, and the bronchioles terminate at these alveoli. So that's the alveoli. These are these super-small sacs that we talked about in the last video on the pulmonary system. You might want to watch that video if none of this sounds familiar."
Health,"And then of course we have our bronchiole that feeds into this, and then that might have branched off from another one that feeds into another set of alveolar sacs, but I don't want to get too focused on that. I covered that in the last video. In the last video, we saw that air, when we breathe in, when our diaphragm contracts and makes our lungs expand and fill up that space, air comes in."
Health,"Air comes in and that air that comes in is going to be-- as we're breathing atmospheric air-- it's going to be 21% oxygen and it's going to be 78% nitrogen. And actually, in our atmosphere, carbon dioxide is actually almost a trace gas. It's less than 1%. So any time you breathe in on Earth, this is what you're going to get. And we said in the last video that you have these capillaries, these pulmonary capillaries that are running all along the side of these alveoli."
Health,"So let me draw those pulmonary capillaries-- and so when they are de-oxygenated-- so they come here to be oxygenated. So when they're de-oxygenated, they might look a little purplish. And then they pick up the oxygen from inside the alveoli-- or the oxygen diffuses across the membrane of the alveoli, into these capillaries, into these super small tubes. And then once they do, that makes the blood red. I'm going to talk in a little bit about why it becomes red."
Health,"So then it becomes red, and now that the blood is red, it has its oxygen. The whole point is to get the oxygen. It's ready to go back to the heart. So that's just one little part of it. And we learned in the last video that something that goes away from the heart-- so this is going away from the heart-- that is an artery. ""A for Away"" - Artery. And something that's going towards the heart is a vein. So this right here is a vein. Now one question-- and this actually came up in the last video."
Health,"Someone asked-- which I think is a very good question-- is, gee, when we breathe in, most of the air is nitrogen. Only 21% is oxygen. What happens to all that nitrogen there? How come that doesn't go into our blood? And that's actually an excellent question. So to answer that, I think that actually helps explain what's going on here. Let's draw a little bit bigger. This is the inside of of an alveolus. This is its membrane right here, super thin, almost one cell thick."
Health,"And then you have a capillary running right next to it. Let me do that in a neutral color. So you have a capillary that's maybe running right along the surface. And this is porous to gases like oxygen, and nitrogen, carbon dioxide. And what we have here-- let's say that this is-- so the heart is over here. So this is blood coming from the heart and then this is going to go back to the heart. Well, the heart's on both sides. So let me write it this way. From the heart and to the heart."
Health,"And what you have here is-- when we're coming from the heart, this is de-oxygenated blood and it's actually going to have a high concentration of carbon dioxide. I already did nitrogen as green. Let me do carbon dioxide as orange. There's a lot of carbon dioxide and actually carbon dioxide actually gets diffused in the blood. It actually is carried in the plasma of the blood. It's not carried by red blood cells that we're going to talk about in a second. So that's a bunch of carbon dioxide here."
Health,"And the concentration of carbon dioxide in the de-oxygenated blood is going to be higher than the concentration of carbon dioxide in the alveolus. so if this is porous to carbon dioxide, this membrane-- and it is, these carbon dioxide molecules are going to diffuse into the alveolus. Now on the other side of that-- we have oxygen here. We're breathing it in. The air is 21% oxygen so you're actually going to have a lot more oxygen than carbon dioxide. And this is de-oxygenated blood."
Health,"We used all of the oxygen in our body and we'll talk more about that either at the end of this video or in a future video on how we use it or where it goes in our body, but there's no oxygen here so the oxygen is going to be taken-- it's going to diffuse across this membrane because the concentration of oxygen is low. Now the question is-- so immediately you see that as the oxygen diffuses across this membrane, all of a sudden, this is oxygenated blood ready to go back to the heart."
Health,"So this transition between artery and vein is a very subtle thing. Very clearly here, you say that, OK, this is going from the heart. This is our vein. This is going to the heart-- sorry. I always get confused. This is going away from the heart-- and I was looking for an A and I wrote from. This is away from the heart so this is an artery. And this is going to the heart so this is a vein. So you could make the division."
Health,"You could say, OK, once it's oxygenated, maybe we're going back to the heart, but it's kind of an arbitrary-- sorry. I spelled artery wrong. These are my flaws. Spelling was never my strong suit. So it's hard to say where the artery ends and the vein begins. A good demarcation is when the carbon dioxide concentration goes low and that the oxygen concentration goes high. That's a good time, where we start from the pulmonary artery."
Health,"Probably in the next video, I will a make a very-- you'll see why the pulmonary arteries are special, because pulmonary arteries coming away from the heart have no oxygen or very little oxygen and they have a lot of carbon dioxide. So pulmonary veins, which is-- it's arbitrary where the artery turns into a vein. Once it gets oxygenated, it's ready to go back to the heart. It's a pulmonary vein and it is oxygenated. So it has oxygenated-- and we could write de-oxygenated."
Health,"Now the reason why I say it's special besides the fact that pulmonary arteries and veins go to and from the lungs, is that they're kind of the opposite. Because in the rest of the body when we're going away from the heart or we're talking about arteries, you're going to see that that's oxygenated blood, while when we're going away from the heart to the lungs, that's de-oxygenated blood."
Health,"Similarly in the rest of the body, when we're going to the heart, where you're to see that that's de-oxygenated blood, but in the pulmonary vein, when we're going to the heart, it's oxygenated because the lungs are what take up the carbon dioxide and give us the oxygen. Now I still haven't answered that interesting question that rose on the message board on the last video."
Health,"What happens to the 78% of nitrogen that's sitting here? There's just a ton of nitrogen over here, more than the oxygen, a lot more than the carbon dioxide. What happens to all of these nitrogen molecules? And the answer is, nitrogen can diffuse and does diffuse into the blood, but the blood's ability to take in nitrogen isn't that high. And you might say, well, why is oxygen special? Why can the blood take up oxygen so much easier than nitrogen? And that's where the red blood cells come into play."
Health,"Let me write this down. I'll write it in red. Red blood cells, which are fascinating on a whole set of levels. What red blood cells-- these are these cells that are sitting in-- they're flowing through our circulatory system and they look kind of like lozenges, if I were to draw one. They're kind of like a flattened sphere with a little divot on either side of it-- a lot like a lozenge."
Health,"So if I were to draw it from the side, it might look something like-- well, from the side, it would look like that and if you could see through it, there'd be a little divot on each side. If I were to draw it at an angle, it would look something like this. There'd be a little divot on that side and there'd be a similar divot on the other side. And red blood cells-- and I could do a whole set of videos just on red blood cells-- they contain hemoglobin. Maybe we'll do a whole video on hemoglobin."
Health,"The hemoglobin are these small proteins that contain four hem groups. So inside of red blood cells, you have millions of hemoglobin proteins. And the hemoglobin proteins-- I'll just draw them as this-- they have these four heme groups. And heme groups, the main component is iron. And that's why iron is so important. If you don't have enough iron, you're going to have trouble processing oxygen in your blood and your hemoglobin won't be functional enough. But it has iron on it."
Health,"It has four of these heme groups. And each of these heme groups can bond to oxygen molecules. They're very good binders of oxygen. And we're going to see in a little bit-- probably the next video-- how they release the oxygen, but this has tons, this has millions of heme groups in it and the oxygen diffuses across the membrane of the red blood cells and bonds to to the heme groups on your hemoglobin."
Health,"So because the red blood cells have the hemoglobin inside of them, they're like these sponges for oxygen because hemoglobin is so good at taking in oxygen. So the red blood cells are able to essentially suck up all of the oxygen out of the plasma. The plasma we can view as just the general fluid of the blood, not including the red blood cells. So the red blood cell here isn't so red."
Health,"And the reason-- and this is the key point-- the reason why it's not so red-- maybe we had a red blood cell over here-- let me make it clear. Carbon dioxide for the most part is traveling within the plasma. It gets absorbed into the actual fluid and I'll talk about it in a future video. It's actually in a slightly different form. It's as carbonic acid and that's actually a key point for how the plasma knows where to dump the oxygen, but I'll talk about that in a future video."
Health,"But over here, this red blood cell has a bunch of hemoglobin proteins in it, but those hemoglobin proteins have dumped their oxygen. And it actually turns out it's the hemoglobin-- so with oxygen, hemoglobin looks red. It reflects red light. When it doesn't have oxygen, hemoglobin does not look red. It looks kind of purplish, bluish, darkish-- something. And that's why in most of your body, your veins that have de-oxygenated red blood cells look kind of bluish."
Health,"And the reason why it changes color is that when the oxygen bonds to the hem sites on the hemoglobin, it actually changes the entire confirmation, the entire structure of the protein. We've see that multiple times. The whole protein folds in such a way that all of a sudden, instead of purplish or dark light being reflected, now red light is reflected. And that's why red blood cells will become red once they take the oxygen. But I'm going on a tangent."
Health,"The whole point here is saying, why we taking up so much more oxygen than nitrogen, given that there's less oxygen in the atmosphere than nitrogen? And the key is these red blood cells. These red blood cells have these millions of hemoglobin proteins inside of them and they take them up and they sop up all of the oxygen out of the plasma. Actually, they sop about 98.5% of the oxygen. So these red blood cells are just traveling and they're going to go back to the heart. They are what make our blood red."
Health,"So you have this thing, hemoglobin, that's sitting in red blood cells. It's sopping up all the oxygen. So it keeps the oxygen concentration and the actual plasma low. You have nothing like that for nitrogen. There is no cell that's sopping up the nitrogen. Nitrogen does not bond to hemoglobin. So that's why oxygen is taken up so much better than nitrogen. It's a very interesting question because if you just think about how much nitrogen is, it's kind of a very natural idea."
Health,"Now I want to focus a little bit on the red blood cell itself because it's fascinating. In the video on the structure of the cell, I start off saying, all cells have a membrane and they all have DNA. Now, the fascinating thing about a red blood cell-- I already said it has millions of hemoglobin molecules or proteins inside of it. The fascinating thing about a red blood cell-- it has no nucleus. And no DNA. This is mind boggling when I first found out."
Health,"I was like, well, why is it a cell? Is it really even a living thing? And it turns out when it's growing, it does have a nucleus. All cells need a nucleus with DNA in order to generate the proteins that build it up, in order to exist and structurally make itself the way it needs to be made, but the whole point of a red blood cell is to contain as much hemoglobin as possible."
Health,"And so you can imagine, this is actually a favorable evolutionary trait, that as red blood cells are ready to go into business, you've built the whole structure, they actually get rid of their nucleus. They actually push their nucleus out of the cell and the whole reason why that's beneficial is, that's more space for hemoglobin. Because the more hemoglobin you have, the more oxygen you can take up."
Health,"And I can do a ton of videos on hemoglobin and all of that-- and actually, I'm going to do a lot more on the circulatory system so don't worry about that, but I want to go over one other really interesting thing about hemoglobin. We already talked about red blood cells. I think it's fascinating that they actually don't have a nucleus in their mature form. They actually have very short lives. They live maybe 80, 120 days so they're not these long lived cells-- so it's almost a philosophical question."
Health,"Are are they still alive once they've lost their DNA or are they just vessels for oxygen that aren't really alive because they aren't regenerating and producing their own DNA? So actually, instead of going into the hemoglobin discussion right now, I'll leave you there in this video. I realize I've been making 20-minute videos where my goal is really to make ten-minute ones. So I'll leave you here and in the next video, we'll talk more about hemoglobin and the circulatory system.."
Health,"There are two of them that are sort of more important than the others, at least for this topic that we're going to talk about, and those are the A molecule and the B molecule. I think you'll be pretty happy with those names, not too hard to remember. I'm actually calling them molecules and not proteins because they're actually not proteins. They are actually something called glycolipids, which I actually didn't realize at first."
Health,"Glycolipids, glyco meaning a sugar group, lipid meaning a fat group, so it's some kind of mix of a sugar and fat. You can look it up if you're interested. What's interesting, is that not all people have both of these molecules, these glycolipids, on their red blood cells. Some people do have both, but some have only one."
Health,"For example, some people might have only the A, or, as you can imagine, some people would have only the B, and some people, can you figure out the last possibility? Some people have neither A nor B. Of course, all these people have all kinds of other proteins and molecules embedded in their red blood cells. The reason why we care about this and why I'm talking about these As and these Bs, is that in medicine, we often have to give blood transfusions."
Health,"Let's say you got in a car accident and you lost a lot of blood. You're rushed to the hospital. If you've lost enough blood, they'll give you a transfusion of blood. Transfusion just means they'll put a needle in your vein and pump blood into your veins. It turns out that you can't just give any blood to anyone, and it has to do with these A and B groups."
Health,"For example, it turns out, and we'll explain this, but for example, it turns out that if you are the kind of person who has this kind of blood that only has As on your blood cells, then it turns out that you can't get a blood transfusion from someone who has this kind of blood, As and Bs. Let's learn why. If you remember from the immune system, there's something called an antibody. We usually draw it in this shape here."
Health,"If you remember from the immune system, your body has something called antibodies, and it uses these antibodies to fight things that it doesn't want in the body. For example, if you have a bacterium, I'm drawing one here, you'll have an antibody that will bind to that bacterium. The purpose of that is that now your body knows that is should destroy this bacterium. This antibody is kind of like a tag that marks this guy for destruction."
Health,"But your body is very careful not to make antibodies against itself, which is obvious, right? If your body made antibodies against itself, then it would start to attack itself. For that reason, someone who has this kind of blood, which means that all of their red blood cells have As and Bs on them, that person would not want to make antibodies against the A and the B molecule, because if they did then their body would attack all of their red blood cells. These people don't have these antibodies."
Health,"But, let's say if you have this kind of blood, then you might not make an antibody against the A molecule, but you can make it against the B molecule, because the B is not in your body, and so there's no risk that your body is going to attack itself by making an antibody against the B molecule. So these guys don't have the A antibody, but they do have the B antibody. These guys, on the other hand, they can have the A antibody, but they don't want the B antibody because then they would attack themselves."
Health,"This final guy, can you guess what he has? He can actually have both A and B antibodies. He actually will have both, because that's the way your immune system works. It makes antibodies against pretty much anything that is not you, that is not yourself. A and B molecules are not part of this guy. He has none of them, so he'll make antibodies against them."
Health,"Let me ask you, what would happen if this guy, someone with just A blood, type A blood, got in a car accident and needed a transfusion? Let's say they're rushed to the hospital and you give them blood from someone with A and B molecules. What would happen is that this guy's antibodies again B would go and bind to the B molecules on the blood that he's just received, and then his body would start to destroy all of these cells that he just received. That's bad because, first of all, it's a waste."
Health,"You gave this guy blood and now he's just going to destroy it. But second of all, it's going to cause a huge amount of inflammation, because this guy's body is going to suddenly see all these antigens that he thinks are really dangerous, and it's going to cause his whole immune system to rev up, and that will actually be bad for him. Let's go through all the different possible transfusions between these different kinds of people. Let's go through them methodically by drawing a table."
Health,"On one side of the table we'll have the donors. Bear with me as I draw this table out. We'll have AB donor, A donor, type B donor, and do you know what we call this kind of blood? We can't call it type B or type A because that's these guys, so we actually call this O, type O. Then we also have the same guys as possible recipients, so we have type AB blood recipient, type A blood recipient, type B blood recipient, and type O blood recipient. Let's make this into a table."
Health,"Here are our donors, blood donors, and here are our blood recipients. What did we say before? We said that someone with type A blood cannot receive blood from someone with type AB blood. So that means that A recipient with AB donor is no good. Well, how about someone with AB blood? Can they receive blood from someone with AB blood? The answer is yes, because the guy with AB blood has no antibodies against A or B, so he won't attack the AB blood that is given to him."
Health,"Why don't you pause the video for a moment and try to fill in the rest of this table? Hopefully you've paused for a second and tried to fill in the rest of the table. Now we'll fill it in together. Someone with AB blood can receive blood from A, he can receive blood from B, and he can receive blood from O because he has no antibodies to either A or B, so he won't react to any of these guys."
Health,"Likewise, someone with type A blood can, of course, receive from A, B can receive from B, O can receive from O, but B cannot receive from AB, nor can O. Nor can B receive from A, nor can O. Nor can O receive from B, nor can A receive from B. But O can give to everyone. Something interesting you'll notice here is, as we just said, O can give to anyone because the O blood type has no As or Bs on it, so no one's going to react to it. For that reason, we call O the universal donor."
Health,"The other interesting thing you'll notice is that AB can receive from everyone. For that reason, we call him the universal recipient. All these things, by the way, AB, A, B, O, these are blood types. So when someone asks you for your blood type, this is what they're referring to. This is why it's really important to know your blood type if you're ever going to require a blood transfusion.."
Health,"It's made up of four amino acid chains. That's one of them. Those are the other two. We're not going to go into the detail of that, but these look like little curly ribbons. If you imagine them, they're a bunch of molecules and amino acids and then they're curled around like that. So this on some level describes its shape. And in each of those groups or in each of those chains, you have a heme group here in green. That's where you get the hem in hemoglobin from."
Health,"You have four heme groups and the globins are essentially describing the rest of it-- the protein structures, the four peptide chains Now, this heme group-- this is pretty interesting. It actually is a porphyrin structure. And if you watch the video on chlorophyll, you'd remember a porphyrin structure, but at the very center of it, in chlorophyll, we had a magnesium ion, but at the very center of hemoglobin, we have an iron ion and this is where the oxygen binds."
Health,"So on this hemoglobin, you have four major binding sites for oxygen. You have right there, maybe right there, a little bit behind, right there, and right there. Now why is hemoglobin-- oxygen will bind very well here, but hemoglobin has a several properties that one, make it really good at binding oxygen and then also really good at dumping oxygen when it needs to dump oxygen. So it exhibits something called cooperative binding."
Health,"And this is just the principle that once it binds to one oxygen molecule-- let's say one oxygen molecule binds right there-- it changes the shape in such a way that the other sites are more likely to bind oxygen. So it just makes it-- one binding makes the other bindings more likely. Now you say, OK, that's fine. That makes it a very good oxygen acceptor, when it's traveling through the pulmonary capillaries and oxygen is diffusing from the alveoli."
Health,"That makes it really good at picking up the oxygen, but how does it know when to dump the oxygen? This is an interesting question. It doesn't have eyes or some type of GPS system that says, this guy's running right now and so he's generating a lot of carbon dioxide right now in these capillaries and he needs a lot of oxygen in these capillaries surrounding his quadriceps. I need to deliver oxygen. It doesn't know it's in the quadraceps."
Health,"How does the hemoglobin know to let go of the oxygen there? And that's a byproduct of what we call allosteric inhibition, which is a very fancy word, but the concept's actually pretty straightforward. When you talk about allosteric anything-- it's often using the context of enzymes-- you're talking about the idea that things bind to other parts. Allo means other."
Health,"So you're binding to other parts of the protein or the enzyme-- and enzymes are just proteins-- and it affects the ability of the protein or the enzyme to do what it normally does. So hemoglobin is allosterically inhibited by carbon dioxide and by protons. So carbon dioxide can bond to other parts of the hemoglobin-- I don't know the exact spots-- and so can protons. So remember, acidity just means a high concentration of protons. So if you're in an acidic environment, protons can bond."
Health,"Maybe I'll do the protons in this pink color. Protons-- which are just hydrogen without electrons, right-- protons can bond to certain parts of our protein and it makes it harder for them to hold onto the oxygen. So when you're in the presence of a lot of carbon dioxide or an acidic environment, this thing is going to let go of its oxygen. And it just happens to be that that's a really good time to let go of your oxygen. Let's go back to this guy running."
Health,"There's a lot of activity in these cells right here in his quadriceps. They're releasing a lot of carbon dioxide into the capillaries. At that point, they're going from arteries into veins and they need a lot of oxygen, which is a great time for the hemoglobin to dump their oxygen. So it's really good that hemoglobin is allosterically inhibited by carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide joins on certain parts of it. It starts letting go of its oxygen, that's exactly where in the body the oxygen is needed."
Health,"Now you're saying, wait. What about this acidic environment? How does this come into play? Well, it turns out that most of the carbon dioxide is actually disassociated. It actually disassociates. It does go into the plasma, but it actually gets turned into carbonic acid. So I'll just write a little formula right here. So if you have some CO2 and you mix it with the water-- I mean, most of our blood, the plasma-- it's water."
Health,"So you take some carbon dioxide, you mix it with water, and you have it in the presence of an enzyme-- and this enzyme exists in red blood cells. It's called carbonic anhydrase. A reaction will occur-- essentially you'll end up with carbonic acid. We have H2CO3. It's all balanced. We have three oxygens, two hydrogens, one carbon. It's called carbonic acid because it gives away hydrogen protons very easily. Acids disassociate into their conjugate base and hydrogen protons very easily."
Health,"So carbonic acid disassociates very easily. It's an acid, although I'll write in some type of an equilibrium right there."
Health,"If any of this notation really confuses you or you want more detail on it, watch some of the chemistry videos on acid disassociation and equilibrium reactions and all of that, but it essentially can give away one of these hydrogens, but just the proton and it keeps the electron of that hydrogen so you're left with a hydrogen proton plus-- well, you gave away one of the hydrogens so you just have one hydrogen. This is actually a bicarbonate ion."
Health,"But it only gave away the proton, kept the electron so you have a minus sign. So all of the charge adds up to neutral and that's neutral over there. So if I'm in a capillary of the leg-- let me see if I can draw this. So let's say I'm in the capillary of my leg. Let me do a neutral color. So this is a capillary of my leg. I've zoomed in just one part of the capillary. It's always branching off."
Health,"And over here, I have a bunch of muscle cells right here that are generating a lot of carbon dioxide and they need oxygen. Well, what's going to happen? Well, I have my red blood cells flowing along. It's actually interesting-- red blood cells-- their diameter's 25% larger than the smallest capillaries. So essentially they get squeezed as they go through the small capillaries, which a lot of people believe helps them release their contents and maybe some of the oxygen that they have in them."
Health,"So you have a red blood cell that's coming in here. It's being squeezed through this capillary right here. It has a bunch of hemoglobin-- and when I say a bunch, you might as well know right now, each red blood cell has 270 million hemoglobin proteins. And if you total up the hemoglobin in the entire body, it's huge because we have 20 to 30 trillion red blood cells. And each of those 20 to 30 trillion red blood cells have 270 million hemoglobin proteins in them. So we have a lot of hemoglobin."
Health,"So anyway, that was a little bit of a-- so actually, red blood cells make up roughly 25% of all of the cells in our body. We have about 100 trillion or a little bit more, give or take. I've never sat down and counted them. But anyway, we have 270 million hemoglobin particles or proteins in each red blood cell-- explains why the red blood cells had to shed their nucleuses to make space for all those hemoglobins. They're carrying oxygen."
Health,"So right here we're dealing with-- this is an artery, right? It's coming from the heart. The red blood cell is going in that direction and then it's going to shed its oxygen and then it's going to become a vein. Now what's going to happen is you have this carbon dioxide. You have a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the muscle cell."
Health,"It eventually, just by diffusion gradient, ends up-- let me do that same color-- ends up in the blood plasma just like that and some of it can make its way across the membrane into the actual red blood cell. In the red blood cell, you have this carbonic anhydrase which makes the carbon dioxide disassociate into-- or essentially become carbonic acid, which then can release protons. Well, those protons, we just learned, can allosterically inhibit the uptake of oxygen by hemoglobin."
Health,"So those protons start bonding to different parts and even the carbon dioxide that hasn't been reacted with-- that can also allosterically inhibit the hemoglobin. So it also bonds to other parts. And that changes the shape of the hemoglobin protein just enough that it can't hold onto its oxygens that well and it starts letting go. And just as we said we had cooperative binding, the more oxygens you have on, the better it is at accepting more-- the opposite happens."
Health,"When you start letting go of oxygen, it becomes harder to retain the other ones. So then all of the oxygens let go. So this, at least in my mind, it's a brilliant, brilliant mechanism because the oxygen gets let go just where it needs to let go. It doesn't just say, I've left an artery and I'm now in a vein. Maybe I've gone through some capillaries right here and I'm going to go back to a vein. Let me release my oxygen-- because then it would just release the oxygen willy-nilly throughout the body."
Health,"This system, by being allosterically inhibited by carbon dioxide and an acidic environment, it allows it to release it where it is most needed, where there's the most carbon dioxide, where respiration is occurring most vigorously. So it's a fascinating, fascinating scheme. And just to get a better understanding of it, right here I have this little chart right here that shows the oxygen uptake by hemoglobin or how saturated it can be."
Health,"And you might see this in maybe your biology class so it's a good thing to understand. So right here, we have on the x-axis or the horizontal axis, we have the partial pressure of oxygen. And if you watched the chemistry lectures on partial pressure, you know that partial pressure just means, how frequently are you being bumped into by oxygen? Pressure is generated by gases or molecules bumping into you. It doesn't have to be gas, but just molecules bumping into you."
Health,"And then the partial pressure of oxygen is the amount of that that's generated by oxygen molecules bumping into you. So you can imagine as you go to the right, there's just more and more oxygen around so you're going to get more and more bumped into by oxygen."
Health,"So this is just essentially saying, how much oxygen is around as you go to the right axis? And then the vertical axis tells you, how saturated are your hemoglobin molecules? This 100% would mean all of the heme groups on all of the hemoglobin molecules or proteins have bound to oxygen. Zero means that none have. So when you have an environment with very little oxygen-- and this actually shows the cooperative binding-- so let's say we're just dealing with an environment with very little oxygen."
Health,"So once a little bit of oxygen binds, then it makes it even more likely that more and more oxygen will bind. As soon as a little-- that's why the slope is increasing. I don't want to go into algebra and calculus here, but as you see, we're kind of flattish, and then the slope increases. So as we bind to some oxygen, it makes it more likely that we'll bind to more."
Health,"And at some point, it's hard for oxygens to bump just right into the right hemoglobin molecules, but you can see that it kind of accelerates right around here. Now, if we have an acidic environment that has a lot of carbon dioxide so that the hemoglobin is allosterically inhibited, it's not going to be as good at this. So in an acidic environment, this curve for any level of oxygen partial pressure or any amount of oxygen, we're going to have less bound hemoglobin. Let me do that in a different color."
Health,"So then the curve would look like this. The saturation curve will look like this. So this is an acidic environment. Maybe there's some carbon dioxide right here. So the hemoglobin is being allosterically inhibited so it's more likely to dump the oxygen at this point. So I don't know. I don't know how exciting you found that, but I find it brilliant because it really is the simplest way for these things to dump their oxygen where needed."
Health,"No GPS needed, no robots needed to say, I'm now in the quadriceps and the guy is running. Let me dump my oxygen. It just does it naturally because it's a more acidic environment with more carbon dioxide. It gets inhibited and then the oxygen gets dumped and ready to use for respiration.."
Health,So this is our blood vessel down here. And oxygen is going to make its way from this alveolus. It's going to go into the blood vessel. And it's going to go from the blood vessel into a little red blood cell. This is my red blood cell here. He's headed out for the first delivery of oxygen that day. And he's going to pick up some oxygen. And it's going to get inside of the red blood cell through diffusion. That's how it gets inside. So the oxygen has made its way into the red blood cell.
Health,"And where do you think it goes first? Well, this red blood cell is, we sometimes think of it as a bag of hemoglobin. It's got millions and millions and millions of hemoglobin proteins. So this is our hemoglobin protein. It's got four parts to it. And each part can bind an oxygen. So hemoglobin, I can shorten this to Hb. Now, oxygen is going to bump into, quite literally bump into one of these hemoglobins. And it's going to bind, let's say, right here."
Health,"And initially, it's kind of tricky because oxygen doesn't feel very comfortable sitting on the hemoglobin or binding to hemoglobin. But once a single oxygen is bound, a second one will come and bind as well. And then a third will find it much easier. Because what's happening is that as each oxygen binds, it actually changes the conformation or shape of hemoglobin. And so each subsequent oxygen has an easier time binding. We call that cooperativity. Has the word, almost like cooperation in it."
Health,"And an easy way to think of cooperativity, the way I think of it, is that if you're at a dinner party, you are much more likely to sit where two or three of your friends are already sitting, if you think of this as a table with four chairs, rather than just sitting at a table by yourself being the first one to sit there. So we kind of like sitting with our friends and oxygen is kind of a friendly molecule. And so it also likes to sit where or bind where other oxygens have already bound."
Health,"What are the two, then, major ways, based on this diagram, how I've drawn it. What are the two major ways that oxygen is going to be transported in the blood? One is hemoglobin binding oxygen. And we call that HbO2. Just Hb for hemoglobin, O2 for oxygen. And this molecule, or this enzyme, then, is not really called hemoglobin anymore. Technically, it's called oxyhemoglobin. That's the name for it."
Health,"And another way that you can actually transport oxygen around is, that some of this oxygen-- I actually underlined it there-- is dissolved, O2 is dissolved in plasma. So some of the oxygen actually just gets dissolved right into the plasma. And that's how it gets moved around. Now, the majority, the vast majority of it is actually going to be moved through binding to hemoglobin. So just a little bit is dissolved in the plasma. The majority is bound to hemoglobin."
Health,"So this red blood cell goes off to do its delivery. Let's say, it's delivering some oxygen out here. And there is a tissue cell. And, of course, it doesn't know where it's going to go that day. But it's going to go wherever its blood flow takes it. So let's say, it takes a pass over to this thigh cell in your, let's say, upper thigh. So this thigh cell has been making CO2. And remember, sometimes we think of CO2 as being made only when the muscle has been working. But you could be napping."
Health,"You could be doing whatever. And this CO2 is still being made because cellular respiration is always happening. So this red blood cell has moved into the capillary right by this thigh cell. So you've got a situation like this where now some of the CO2 is going to diffuse into the red blood cell like that. And what happens once it gets down there? So let me draw out, now, a large version of the red blood cell. Just so you get a closer view of what's going on."
Health,"And we're in the thigh and the two big conditions in the thigh that we have to keep in mind. One is that you have a high amount of CO2 or partial pressure of CO2. And this is dissolved in the blood. And the other is that you have a low amount of oxygen, not too much oxygen in those tissues. So let's focus on that second point. If there's not too much oxygen in the tissues, and we know that the hemoglobin is kind of constantly bumping into oxygen molecules and binding them."
Health,"And they fall off and new ones bind. So it's kind of a dynamic process. Now, when there's not too much oxygen around, these oxygen molecules are going to fall off as they always do in a dynamic situation. Except new ones are not going to bind. Because there's so little oxygen around in the area, that less and less oxygen is free and is available to bump into hemoglobin and bind to it."
Health,"So you're going to literally start getting some oxygen that falls off the hemoglobin simply because the partial pressure of oxygen is low. So one reason for oxygen to come into the cells is going to be a low pO2. That's one reason. So these are reasons-- and I'm going to give you another one, that's why I'm writing reasons-- for O2 delivery. So one of them is going to be simply not having too much oxygen in that area. A second reason has to do with CO2 itself."
Health,"So let's actually follow what happens once CO2 starts getting into the red blood cell. Now, this first CO2 molecule, it's going to meet up with a little water. Remember, there's a lot of water in the red blood cell. In fact, there's water all over the blood. In fact, it's made of mostly water. And so it's not too hard to imagine that a water molecule might bump into this CO2. And there's an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase."
Health,"And what it does is, it combines the water and the CO2 into what we call H2CO3, or carbonic acid. Now, if it's an acid, try to keep in mind what acids do. Acids are going to kick off a proton. So this becomes HCO3 minus. And it kicks off a proton. And notice that now you've got bicarb and proton on this side. And this bicarb is actually going to just make its way outside. So the bicarb goes outside the cell. And the proton, what it does is, it meets up with one of these oxyhemoglobins."
Health,"It kind of finds an oxyhemoglobin. Remember, there are millions of them around. And it literally binds to hemoglobin. And it boots off the oxygen. So it binds to hemoglobin and oxygen falls away. So this is interesting because now this is a second reason for why oxygen gets delivered to the tissues. And that is that, protons compete with oxygen for-- what are they competing for-- for binding with hemoglobin. So they're competing for hemoglobin."
Health,"Now I said there is another thing that happens to the carbon dioxide. So what's the other thing? Turns out that carbon dioxide actually sometimes independently seeks out oxyhemoglobin. Remember, again, there are millions of them. So it'll find one. And it'll do the same thing. It'll say, well, hey, hemoglobin, why don't you just come bind with me and get rid of that oxygen? So it also competes with oxygen. So you've got some competition from protons, some competition from carbon dioxide."
Health,"And when carbon dioxide actually binds, interesting thing is that it makes a proton. So guess what happens? That proton can go and compete again by itself. It can compete with oxyhemoglobin and try to kick off another one, kick off another oxygen. So this system is really interesting because now you've got a few reasons why you have oxygen delivery. You've got protons competing. You've got now CO2 competing with oxygen. So you've got a couple of sources of competition."
Health,"And you've got, of course, just simply the fact that there's just not too much oxygen around. So these are reasons for oxygen delivery. So at this point, you've got oxygen that's delivered to the cells. And these hemoglobin molecules, they're still our cell, of course, inside of a red blood cell. And these hemoglobin molecules have now been bound by different things. So they're no longer bound by oxygen. So you can't really call them oxyhemoglobin anymore. Instead they have protons on them like this."
Health,"And they might have some COO minus on them. So they might have-- actually, let me do that in the original kind of orangey color. So they basically have different things binding to them. And as a result, the oxygen is now gone. And our system, so far, looks good. But let me actually now turn it around. And let's ask the question, how do we carry carbon dioxide from the thigh back to the lung? Let me start out by actually replacing the word thigh with lung. So now, our blood has traveled back to the lung."
Health,"And the question is, how much carbon dioxide did it bring with it? And in what different forms did that carbon dioxide come? So we've got a couple of situations. We've got a high amount of oxygen here. And we've got a low amount of CO2. So really quite different than what was happening in the thigh. So when the blood is leaving the thigh headed back to the lung, what's it got with it? Well, it's got a few things. One is that it's got hemoglobin that is bound to carbon dioxide."
Health,"And this is actually called carbaminohemoglobin. And then, it's also got some protons that are bound to hemoglobin. So the protons themselves are attached to hemoglobin. And just keep in mind that for every proton that's attached to hemoglobin, you've also got a bicarb dissolved in the plasma. Because it's a one-to-one ratio of these things. So you've got a bunch of bicarb in the plasma as well. And I'm writing in parentheses just so we don't forget that point."
Health,"And finally, what else is in the blood? We've got some CO2 that just gets dissolved right into the plasma. So this is sounding a little bit like what happened with the oxygen situation, where you had some CO2 in the plasma itself. And this is what's headed back from the thigh to the lung. So now in the lung, what happens? You've got all this stuff with you. And the first thing that happens is that, you've got a lot of oxygen, now, in the area. A lot of oxygen in the tissue of the lung."
Health,"And it diffuses into the cell, goes into the cell. And the oxygen is, because there's so much of it, it's going to go and try to sit in these hemoglobins. It's going to try to find its spot. And if it does, what it does in terms of equations is kind of the reverse of what happened before. Now you've got a lot of oxygen here. You've got a lot of oxygen here. And because these are reversible reactions, you basically push this entire reaction to the left. So now, you've got a lot of oxygen."
Health,"And it basically competes for that hemoglobin again. So remember, before the protons actually ended up snatching hemoglobin away from oxygen, and now oxygen returns the favor. It says, well, I'm going to snatch that hemoglobin right And you've got this proton that's kind of the left out by itself. And on this side, you've got this CO2 that's kind of left out by itself. So a couple of interesting things are happening. Let me actually make sure I keep track of them up here."
Health,"So what are some reasons, now, what are some reasons for CO2 delivery? How is it getting delivered back to the lungs? And the first one, probably the most obvious one, is that we said that the lungs have a low CO2 content. So simply having very little CO2 around means that whatever is there is going to diffuse into the alveolus. So you're going to get whatever's in the red blood cells going to diffuse in here. Simply because there's not a lot of CO2 around."
Health,"So instead of diffusing into the red blood cell, now it's going to want to diffuse out. A second reason, though this is the more interesting reason, is that you actually have oxygen competing, oxygen competes with protons and CO2. So it's competing with protons and CO2 for hemoglobin. And that's what we drew in our equation down there. So what it does is it basically gets you back to the oxyhemoglobin. That's the first thing."
Health,"And that's what we've already drawn there is that, we've drawn oxygen bound to hemoglobin. But it means that these little CO2s fall off. They fall off. These little protons fall off. And they're back in the side of the cell, back in the inside of the cell. So if you're CO2 you can, again, you can just diffuse into the alveolus. But if you're a proton, let's say you're a proton and you just fell off of the hemoglobin because it got snatched away by oxygen."
Health,"Well then, this little bicarb is going to come back inside. This bicarb comes back inside. And it combines with a proton. And these two form, you guessed it, H2CO3. So they, remember, this is reversible as well. So they go back. And they form H2CO3. And it turns out that you can actually go from H2CO3 over here also using carbonic anhydrase. So you can basically just do this whole reaction backwards. And now, you can see that you've got more CO2 formed."
Health,"So by having bicarb dissolved in the blood, or in the plasma, it's kind of just staying there and kind of waiting it out. And as soon as those protons are bumped off of the hemoglobin, they go and combine with them and form the CO2. So you've got CO2 coming from here, from the bicarb. You've got CO2 coming from the carbaminohemoglobin. And you've also got the CO2-- remember, we said that some CO2 dissolved in the plasma. So three different ways that CO2 is actually coming back."
Health,"And once all that CO2 is in the lungs, it's going to diffuse right into the alveolus because the amount of CO2 in there is so darn low that the diffusion gradient gets it going towards the alveolus. And of these different strategies, the most important one, the one that gets us most of our carbon dioxide transportation, is this one. This middle one where the protons are actually binding hemoglobin and all that bicarbonate is dissolved in plasma."
Health,"So of the three different ways that carbon dioxide comes back, that's the one you should pay most particular attention to.."
Health,"She scored a goal, and then she tripped and fell, and scrapped her knee, and then she started to bleed. Now, normally our bodies want to make sure that our blood, which flows through our blood vessels stays in our body. If we have an injury that allows blood to leak out of the blood vessel and out of our body, we want to make sure we can stop that. We do that through a process called hemostasis. It's through hemostasis that we create this clot. This clot allows the bleeding to stop."
Health,"It stabilizes the injury in the blood vessel, and it gives the blood vessel time to heal. Now, let's take a look at exactly what's going on in Mary's knee, and exactly how we make this clot. So, here we have a blood vessel, and in our blood vessel we have our blood. In our blood, we have many different types of cells. One of the most important ones is our red blood cell that carries oxygen all over to all our tissues in our body."
Health,"In this blood vessel, we make sure that blood is flowing smoothly in one direction. Did you know that if we were to line up all of our blood vessels, the total length of our blood vessels would come out to about 150 thousand kilometers? Which, is about 93 thousand miles. This is the same distance as if you were to travel around the Earth a little bit less than four times. So, you can see our blood vessels have a lot of work to do."
Health,"One of the cells that helps with this are the cells that line the inner wall of the blood vessel. The cells that communicate with the blood. These cells are called endothelial cells. It's these cells that allow the blood to flow smoothly, and these are the cells that communicate with the blood whenever there's been a injury, and hemostatisis needs to begin. Now, let's take a look at Mary's knee. She scrapped her knee, so, let's cause a break in her skin. Let's say this is her skin."
Health,"She also caused damage to the blood vessel underneath. So, let me erase this. Let me cause some damage to the blood vessel. You can see blood that should be flowing in this direction now can come out of the blood vessel, and out of the skin in this direction. We want to stop this. The way we stop this is through hemostasis. There are two stages to hemostasis. The first stage is primary hemostasis. This begins immediately after there's been an injury."
Health,"What happens is the endothelial cells, at that sight of injury, begin to secrete proteins. This sends signals to the blood that there's been an injury. In our blood we have platelets, these platelets are made in the bone marrow just like red blood cells, and their purpose is to respond to injured blood vessels. I drew them as squares, but their actually about this small compared to red blood cell. The reason I drew squares is I want to make a note of what they carry inside of them."
Health,"They carry these sacs or granules that carry molecules and proteins that are necessary for hemostasis. So, they store them, and they're ready for use whenever needed. What happens is, the endothelial cells secrete these proteins and send a signal to the platelets to come to that sight of injury. Then, a sequence of events happens with the platelets. I won't go into details here, but it allows the platelets to stick to that sight of injury. They get activated. They change shape."
Health,"They release what they have inside, and then they start clumping together and call more platelets, and cause more platelets to clump there as well. What we end up with is what we call a platelet plug. This is the first step of stopping any bleeding. This is still kind of weak, and we need to make this stronger. That's where secondary hemostasis comes into play. In secondary hemostasis, we make this platelet plug stronger with a protein called fibrin."
Health,"What fibrin does is it lays over and links up on top of this platelet plug, and makes it tighter and sturdier. It's like tying a knot. In order to prevent it from getting loose, you double-knot it or triple-knot it. This is exactly what fibrin is doing. Fibrin doesn't flow in our blood as fibrin, it carries around an extra piece of protein, and when it has this extra piece of protein, it's called fibrinogen. So, we need a way of getting fibrin from fibrinogen."
Health,"The way we do that is with this family of proteins called coagulation factors. I'm drawing them all in one color, but there are several different types of coagulation factors. The injured blood vessel will send signals to these coagulation factors to get activated, and once when one gets activated, it will activate another, and activate another, and activate another, and then ultimately, that extra protein on fibrinogen will get cut off."
Health,"That will allow fibrin to link up on the platelet plug and make it stronger. This sequence of activation of coagulation factors is what we call the coagulation cascade. I won't go into the details here either. It's just key to remember that in secondary hemostasis, we make this platelet plug stronger by getting fibrin from fibrinogen through the coagulation cascade, and it's with this fibrin mesh over the platelet plug, that we create this clot."
Health,"It's this clot that stops bleeding, allows blood flow to continue through the blood vessel, and allows the blood vessel to heal.."
Health,"And each of those has organs. And all of those organs are made of tissues. And all of those tissues are made of cells. And it's crazy, but there are 100 trillion-- or at least roughly 100 trillion cells in our body. So it's curious then how do those 100 trillion different parts communicate? Well, one way is through the nervous system and through the pre-laid tracks of nerves. But not every part of the body is connected by nerves."
Health,"I mean how, for example, would part of the brain go about communicating with part of the kidney? Well, to talk about that we're going to have to talk about the endocrine system. And the endocrine system is a system of organs that are called glands. And these glands secrete little chemical messages that are called hormones."
Health,And they release those little chemical messages called hormones into the bloodstream so that they can circulate from one part of the body to another part of the body in order to initiate an effect. And there are many parts of the body that use these hormones to communicate. But certain organs are really defined by this method of communication and we call them endocrine glands. And so one of the major endocrine glands is the hypothalamus. And the hypothalamus is located right here.
Health,"It's a member of the forebrain. And as a member of the brain, it receives a lot of those signals that we talked about from the nervous system. So those nerve signals are funnelling into the brain. And the hypothalamus then, as a kind of dual member of the endocrine system, funnels those signals into the pituitary gland. And so because it plays that dual role between the endocrine system and the nervous system, it often gets taglined as the control center of the endocrine system."
Health,"In addition to stimulating the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus actually make some hormones itself also. And so it makes ADH and oxytocin. And ADH is antidiuretic hormone. And it's a main regulator of our fluid volume in our body. And then oxytocin is a hormone that stimulates the uterus to contract for females during pregnancy. And so that's the hypothalamus, member of the brain and member of the endocrine system where it all begins, the control center."
Health,"And then right below the hypothalamus is the pituitary gland. And the pituitary gland is located right here, dangling right below. And so the hypothalamus is about the size of a grape. And the pituitary gland is actually about the size of a green pea. But this little green pea is so important that it's called the master gland."
Health,"And it's called the master gland because the pituitary gland takes that stimulation from the hypothalamus and it directs it to all of the other endocrine glands, or at least almost all of the other endocrine glands, such that their function is ultimately dependent on the pituitary gland to work well. And so that little green pea is a really important part of the endocrine system. And so one of the endocrine glands that the pituitary directs is the thyroid gland."
Health,"And the thyroid gland is located right here in your neck. It wraps around your trachea. And your trachea is your windpipe. And so you can feel this thyroid gland on your neck as you swallow. If you hold your hands right around your Adam's apple and swallow, that meaty thing moving up and down, that's your thyroid gland. And one of its main jobs is regulating your body's metabolism. And it does that through the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. And another name for T3 is triiodothyronine."
Health,"And another name for T4 is thyroxine. But the thyroid uses these hormones, the thyroid hormones, to stimulate the body's metabolism, which is crucial because that's how our body gets energy. And then right behind that thyroid gland are four spots known collectively as the parathyroid. And the main role of the parathyroid is regulating our body's blood calcium level. And the level of calcium in our blood is hugely important because calcium does a lot of stuff in our bodies."
Health,"It's involved in muscle contraction. It's involved in bone growth. And all of those functions are really sensitive to the level of calcium that's floating around in our blood. And so the parathyroid glands, those four spots on the back side of our thyroid, regulate calcium through the parathyroid hormone, or PTH. And then moving down the torso, we have the adrenal glands. And the adrenal glands are located right on top of the kidneys here."
Health,"And they're called the adrenal glands because they're adjacent to or right next to the kidney system, which is called the renal system in medical speak. But we really need to further divide the adrenal glands into two parts, the outer part and the inner part. So the outer part is the cortex and the inner part is the medulla. And the reason for the distinction is that the inside and the outside of the adrenal glands have two different functions. And so we'll start with the outside or the cortex."
Health,"And that's where the steroids, the adrenal corticosteroids, are made. And two major examples of steroids made in the adrenal cortex are cortisol and aldosterone. And cortisol is one of the body's stress hormones. So it functions to increase blood sugar in times of stress so we have energy. And it also has some anti-inflammatory functioning. And then aldosterone is one of the major regulating hormones of our body's blood volume and how much fluid is in our veins and arteries. And so that's the cortex."
Health,"And then the medulla makes a class of hormones called catecholamines. And two major examples of catecholamines are epinephrine and norepinephrine. And I'm going to shorten those as epi and norepi. And sometimes epinephrine is called adrenaline. And that might be a little bit more familiar to you. But these catecholamines are really involved in our body's fight or flight response, that adrenaline response that we have to a stressful or scary situation."
Health,"And so the medulla and the cortex make up the adrenal glands. But moving down the list and down the body, we have the gonads. And in females, those are the ovaries, and in males, the testes. And the gonads release the sex hormones. And so in males, the testes produce testosterone. And in females, the ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone. But these sex hormones are mainly involved in the development of our secondary sex characteristics like pubic hair, and larger frames in males, and breasts in women."
Health,"But they're also involved in progressing us through those life stages that accompany those sex characteristics, like puberty and menopause. And then last, but not least, we have the pancreas. And it's located right here in the upper part of the abdomen. And I saved the pancreas for last because it isn't involved as directly with the pituitary glands as the other endocrine hormones were. But it still uses those hormones to stimulate an effect in a different part of the body."
Health,"And the effect that the pancreas stimulates is control over the blood sugar. And it does that through the hormones insulin and glucagon. And the pancreas is vitally important because without its hormones insulin and glucagon, we can't regulate how much sugar is in the body's blood versus the cells. And that can lead to major diseases like diabetes. And so with the pancreas, we can conclude our list of major endocrine glands."
Health,"And so as we look at these glands and at these hormones and we think about all of the different effects that are being stimulated in our body by them, it becomes pretty clear that there aren't just a few of these circulating in our bloodstream. There are literally loads of hormones circulating through our vasculature at any given moment. And so that poses a potential problem."
Health,"If, say, that you're in the brain and you're trying to tell something to the kidney, you're trying to send him a message, and you put that in the bloodstream and you just float it down to him, how do you know that it's going to get there? I mean, isn't that what every other endocrine gland is trying to do? Well, it turns out that hormones are a lot like radio waves."
Health,"In your city or in your town, there are many different radio stations and there are many different songs being played at any given time by those radio stations. And even maybe from the next town over, there are radio waves filling the air of your town. But unless you're tuned in specifically to that station, you're not going to pick up on the song that's being transmitted. And in a very similar way, a hormone is not going to be received unless there's a very specific receptor on the target cell."
Health,"And so the receptor and its location are very important in determining the hormone function. And we have classes that we use to help us identify which hormones fall into which function. And so the first class are autocrine hormones. And the autocrine hormones function at the cell that makes them. An example of this is the T-cell in the immune system. It actually secretes a hormone that it makes called an interleukin, that signals the cell itself to increase its effectiveness and its immune function."
Health,"And then another class of hormones are paracrine hormones. And paracrine hormones function regionally. And an example of that might be the hormones released by the hypothalamus that direct the pituitary gland. And then last, but not least, kind of the classic class of hormones are the endocrine hormones. And these are the hormones that function at a distance. And an example of this might be the pituitary gland stimulating the gonads, way far away."
Health,"And so we have autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine classes that help us determine how a hormone functions. And so I know I just told you a whole lot about hormones. But this is your introduction into one of the most important ways that the 100 trillion little tiny individual parts of your body communicate.."
Health,And then the next major gland that we need is the pituitary gland. And the pituitary gland is the gland that dangles right below the hypothalamus. And you can see that the hypothalamus is a structure right here in the forebrain and the pituitary dangles right beneath it.
Health,"And as a member of the brain, the hypothalamus receives neural signals from the brain and from the peripheral nervous system, and it funnels those signals to the pituitary gland, which ultimately controls the other endocrine glands and our body's hormonal response to the environment. And there are two different parts to the pituitary gland. You have the anterior pituitary gland, and then you have the posterior pituitary gland."
Health,"And the hypothalamus interacts with the anterior and posterior part in two different ways. And so it interacts with the anterior pituitary gland, primarily through the hypophyseal portal system which, I've kind of drawn in here. And the hypophyseal portal system is a capillary system, so little blood vessels that flow between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland."
Health,"And the hypothalamus secretes hormones into this little system, and they go down and they signal the pituitary gland, and so that would be an example of a paracrine signal, or a really regionally-acting signal. And so one example of the hypothalamus hormones that signal the pituitary gland is gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH."
Health,"And gonadotropin-releasing hormone is going to go down to the anterior pituitary, and it's going to stimulate the release of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone-- so FSH and LH. And these hormones are going to travel down to the gonads-- in the male, the testes, and in the female, the ovaries-- and they're going to stimulate the gonads to release their hormones."
Health,"Another example of how the hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland, which ultimately controls the endocrine glands, is corticotropin-releasing hormone. And corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulates the anterior pituitary's release of adrenocorticotropic hormone-- ACTH. Adrenocorticotropic hormone goes down to the adrenal glands, and it stimulates the adrenal gland's release of its hormones. And so moving along, the hypothalamus also releases thyroid-releasing hormone, or TRH."
Health,"And thyroid-releasing hormone goes down to the anterior pituitary, and it stimulates the anterior pituitary's release of thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH. And thyroid-stimulating hormone goes down, and it stimulates the thyroid gland to release its hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine. And so continuing in that list, you have growth-hormone-releasing hormone. And growth-hormone-releasing hormone is the hypothalamus's signal to the pituitary gland to release its hormone, growth hormone."
Health,"And growth hormone goes to the long bones and the big muscles in our body, and it stimulates growth. And then last but not least, we have prolactin inhibitory factor, PIF. And prolactin inhibitory factor is a little bit different, because it's constantly being released. And when it stops being released, that's when the pituitary gland is signaled to release prolactin, and prolactin is a hormone involved in milk production in moms."
Health,"And so some of the anterior pituitary hormones go down and directly stimulate other endocrine glands, like FSH and LH, but some of the anterior pituitary glands directly affect parts of the body, like growth hormone and prolactin. And so there's a nice mnemonic, FLAT PEG, which helps me remember which one's which. Because FSH, LH, ACTH, and TSH, or the FLAT hormones, are called tropic hormones. Let me get a different color for this."
Health,"And the tropic hormones are hormones that stimulate other endocrine glands. PEG hormones are the direct hormones, and they include prolactin and growth hormone. And the E is for endorphins, which I haven't included in this list because the anterior pituitary does release endorphins, but so do a lot of other parts of the body. So E is for endorphins, but the PEG hormones are direct hormones. And direct hormones stimulate a part of the body directly."
Health,"So growth hormone directly stimulates the bones and the muscles, and prolactin directly stimulates lactation. And so the hypothalamus signals the anterior pituitary's release of its hormones through the hypophyseal portal system, or this little capillary bed. And then the hypothalamus also communicates with the posterior pituitary, and it does that through stimulation of nerves which run down that pituitary stalk right here."
Health,"And the hypothalamus sends a signal down those nerves to the posterior pituitary and causes the posterior pituitary to release a couple hormones, too. And I want to make a point, because the posterior pituitary releases these hormones, but they're actually made in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary. And the two major hormones are ADH and oxytocin. And ADH is antidiuretic hormone. It stimulates the collecting ducts in the kidneys to retain water."
Health,"And oxytocin is a hormone involved in uterine contractions in women. And so you see that a lot of the endocrine control in the body ultimately comes back to the pituitary gland, which is then controlled by the hypothalamus, which forms the bridge between the nervous system and the endocrine system. And so as big as the names of the hormones get, the idea behind them is pretty manageable. It's really just one part of the body stimulating another part of the body through chemical messages.."
Health,"And so it turns out that the hormone concentration in our blood at any given time is pretty tightly controlled. And one of the ways that it's controlled is through this idea of metabolism and excretion. And so for every hormone that reaches its receptor, thousands more are swept up and removed by the body. And one of the ways that to remove this through the liver. And the liver will metabolize extra hormones and turn them into bile, which is ultimately excreted in the digestive system."
Health,And another organ is the kidney. And you have two of these. And they're filtering your blood all of the time. And they're removing waste products from the blood through urine. And then some hormones are actually just broken down in the blood. And then at the products of that breakdown flow into the liver or the kidneys. And then sometimes you can even sweat these hormones out.
Health,"But the idea here is that all of the time for all the hormones reaching the receptors, a lot are swept up and removed from the body. And another way that concentrations of hormones in the body are controlled are through feedback loops. And the majority of feedback loops are what we consider to be negative feedback loops. And the idea behind negative feedback loops is that conditions resulting from the hormone action suppress further releases of those hormones. And that can be a pretty confusing idea."
Health,"So I'm going to draw an example. So we have the hypothalamus here. I'm going to draw it in. And I'll write it down. And the hypothalamus releases a hormone, thyroid-releasing hormone-- so TRH. And it releases it. And it goes down to the pituitary gland, which I'll drawn in, in right here. And in response to TRH, the pituitary gland releases thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH. And TSH goes down to the thyroid glands, which would be about right here."
Health,"And the thyroid gland releases its hormones, T3, or triiodothyronine, and throxine. And these thyroid hormones travel all throughout the body in search of the receptors in order to, let's say, up-regulate metabolism. That's one of the major jobs of the thyroid glands. And so here's where the idea becomes pretty cool. Because some of the receptors are located on the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus."
Health,"And as the thyroid hormones reach the pituitary and the hypothalamus, they signal the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to stop making their hormones. And the hypothalamus and pituitary gland see that we have enough thyroid hormones in the blood and that they don't need to make any anymore. And so this is a major way that the thyroid hormone levels in the body are controlled. And you might say, hey, that sounds a little bit redundant."
Health,"I mean if the hypothalamus can be turned off by the thyroid hormones and it's upstream from the pituitary gland, then why does the pituitary gland even have to have these receptors? But the redundance is really just a reflection of how important feedback control is and how important the concentration of hormones in the body is. And so hopefully what we can see is that the hormone levels in the body aren't haphazard and aren't willy-nilly. And that concentration is important.."
Health,"And I say more importantly because the structure of a hormone really determines how it works. And so that's what I want to talk about today, the three major types of hormones. And the first major type of hormones are proteins and polypeptides. And just as a refresher, proteins and polypeptides are made up of amino acids. And these amino acids are linked together with peptide bonds. And so many peptide bonds come together to form a polypeptide or a protein."
Health,"And these proteins and polypeptides form most of our body's hormones. And these hormones can range from small to large. And to give you an example of what I mean by that, imagine it's three or so amino acids linked together forming a hormone. That would be a small polypeptide. In three amino acids, we're talking about a handful of atoms, maybe 20 or so atoms. And just as a frame of reference, a cell in your body, one cell, has on the order of a trillion atoms just inside that one cell."
Health,"And there are 100 trillion cells in your body. And so we're talking about very, very, very small things. And they can range from these small collections of amino acids, all the way to hundreds and hundreds of amino acids. So they can get quite large. And the break point becomes right around 100. And that's where we shift from calling them polypeptides to proteins."
Health,"And just like all proteins in your body that are going to be excreted, proteins and polypeptides hormones are made in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. And I'll shorten that to ""RER."" And they go from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. And from the Golgi apparatus, they're kind of repackaged into vesicles that can eventually be excreted from the cell. And because proteins and polypeptides are made of amino acids, they're typically charged."
Health,"Which makes them water soluble, but it also gives them a really hard time crossing cell membranes. And so typically the receptors are located in or on a cell surface. And because the receptors are located in or on a cell surface and these protein and polypeptide hormones can't actually travel into the cell, what they do is they initiate a cascade effect of secondary messengers inside the cell. And I'm going to do an entire video about how that signaling cascade using secondary messengers actually works."
Health,"But the main idea is that when these protein and polypeptide hormones bind to the cell surface, they initiate a response inside the cell. And we refer to that as a secondary messenger system. And so to save some time, I went ahead and drew in an example of a polypeptide hormone. And I'm going to kind of fade it in for us. And I want to show you on this drawing where the peptide bonds are because these peptide bonds really pull this class together and unify them."
Health,"And so right in between the carbon and the nitrogen here and the carbon and the nitrogen here, I'll draw some arrows. These are the peptide bonds that I was referring too, these carbon-nitrogen bonds. And so they can be small and they can be large. But these links of amino acids that are used as chemical messengers to signal effects in the body are called proteins and polypeptides. And one example is insulin. Insulin is a relatively large hormone. And it's a protein hormone."
Health,"So we've got proteins and polypeptides. And then the second major type of hormones are steroids. And when we hear steroids, I don't know, the first thought that comes to my mind are a bunch of athletes getting in trouble with their regulating committees. But steroids are actually one of the major types of hormones used in our body to communicate. And so there are a lot of steroids in our body. But steroids come from lipids. And the major lipid that these steroids come from is cholesterol."
Health,"And because they come from cholesterol, steroids have a really characteristic structure that all of them share. And so I went ahead and I predrew that as well. I'm going to fade that in. And so this is kind of the characteristic steroid backbone. And so you can see there are four ring structures here. And these rings are made of carbon atoms. And so there are three cyclohexane rings or six-membered carbon rings and one cyclopentane ring. And I'm going to label those A, B, C, and D."
Health,"And what this characteristic structure, comes a really characteristic way of signaling a cell. And so unlike proteins and polypeptides, whose receptors are on the cell surface, steroids, because they're made of lipids, have a really easy time passing through the cell membrane. And their receptors are located inside the cell. And so steroids usually go all the way inside of the cell to signal the receptor as primary messengers. They're actually doing the signaling."
Health,"And oftentime, their receptors are located either in the cytoplasm or all the way in the nucleus. But steroids typically go in, and their effect goes all the way down to the transcription and translation level of proteins. And so as primary messengers, they're going inside the cell, and they're effecting a change in that cell that's going to result in the transcription and the translation of new proteins and new products inside the cell."
Health,"And I'm going to do a video on how these steroids actually affect the cell as well. But for now, I want you to be thinking of steroids as one of the major hormones that are in our body, not just a means for athletes getting an edge on the competition. And so some examples of big steroids in the body are those that come from the adrenal cortex, like cortisol and aldosterone, and those hormones that come from the gonads, like the sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen and progesterone."
Health,"And so we've got steroids. And we've got proteins and polypeptides. And the third major type of hormones by structure are tyrosine derivatives. And tyrosine derivatives come from the amino acid tyrosine. And you might have caught on that I said these come from tyrosine, which is an amino acid. And I told you earlier that protein and polypeptide hormones are made of amino acids."
Health,"And so you might ask yourself, why do these get their own major class if these are also made of an amino acid? And what makes them really special, A, is that they're made up of one amino acid. So one amino acid, tyrosine, is manipulated to make these hormones. And B, these hormones that are derived from tyrosine end up being able to sometimes act like proteins and polypeptides and sometimes act like steroids. So they really get their own class."
Health,"And an example of tyrosine derivatives in the body are those that come from the thyroid gland, like T3 and T4, or triiodothyronine and thyroxine, that stimulate metabolism. And these tyrosine derivatives act really similarly to steroids. And then another example of tyrosine derivatives are catecholamines. And catecholamines are those hormones that are produced in the adrenal medulla that are involved in our fight or flight responses, like epinephrine and norepinephrine."
Health,And these thyrosine derivatives act really similarly to peptides by binding on the outside of the cell and releasing those secondary messengers inside the cell. And so the thyroid hormones that are tyrosine derivatives act like steroids. And the catecholamine tyrosine derivatives act like proteins and polypeptides. But it's important to remember that they form their own unique class because they're all derived from the amino acid tyrosine.
Health,"And because I did it for proteins, and polypeptides, and steroids, I went ahead and I drew in what tyrosine looks like. So that's tyrosine. And that's the amino acid that this class of hormones is derived from. And so I know it's hard to make learning these types of hormones fun."
Health,"But maybe at least we can let our minds blow up a little bit over the fact that the structure of these hormones dictates almost everything we think or do, from fear, to hunger, to urinating, and pushing babies All of our responses to the world around us are signaled by hormones.."
Health,"And so the first major mechanism of hormone action at the cell that I'm going to start with is by secondary messengers. And I'm going to start with secondary messengers because, historically, they're a little bit more confusing. But essentially what's happening is a hormone is binding to a receptor on a cell. So let me draw a cell and its receptor. And I'll draw a hormone binding to it."
Health,"But the process of that binding, instead of just stimulating the effect, it really sets off this chain reaction that leads to secondary messengers inside the cell being released. So let me draw those. And you've got these secondary messengers being released, and these are actually what's stimulating whatever effect is desired, whether that may be insulin being released or glucose being taken up inside the cell, or any of the other countless things taking place in our bodies that are controlled by hormones."
Health,"And so in order to give you a visual for how this might take place in the cell, I've pre-drawn some pictures in the key. So let me pull those in here. And I want you to be sure that these drawings are not to scale in any way. But really, this is the best I can at least do in explaining the process, because all of this is happening at the atomic level, and atoms are really tiny. But anyway, what we have in this picture is a receptor. And I've drawn that in pink, and it's located inside the cell membrane."
Health,"So this is the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane, and we've got the inside of the cell, and the outside. And then also in the cell membrane, we've got a G protein, and I've drawn that in green. It's called a G protein because it binds to molecules that include the nucleotide guanine. And that's the same G from the DNA bases that you might be a little bit more familiar with. But it's currently bound to a molecule called guanine diphosphate. And then we'll see how that changes."
Health,"But we also have this adenylate cyclase enzyme that's in the cell membrane. And remember that an enzyme speeds up reaction. So we're going to see how adenlyate cyclase speeds up a reaction. But what starts this process off is the hormone is going to bind to the receptor. So it's going to look like that. And you're going to have the hormone bound to the receptor. And once that hormone binds to the receptor, it's going to change shape."
Health,"And that's going to allow it to interact with the G protein And so that looks like this. And what you saw happen was that as the G protein interacts with the receptor in a hormone complex, it's going to exchange that GDP that it started with, that guanine diphosphate for GTP. So essentially, it's exchanging a guanine bound to two phosphates for a guanine bound to three phosphates. And what happens is that enables the G protein to move through the cell membrane and interact with adenylate cyclase."
Health,"And so that activates the adenylate cyclase. And as an enzyme, that activated adenylate cyclase facilitates the conversion of ATP, which is the energy currency of the cell, into cAMP. And cAMP stands for cyclic adenosine monophosphate. So we've taken this ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, and created a cyclic adenosine monophosphate. And we also have the additional two phosphates."
Health,"But it is this cAMP molecule that activates the protein inside the cell whose effect is really being targeted by the hormone in the first place. And so eventually, this system resets, but not before several adenlyate cyclase enzymes were activated, resulting in a lot of cAMP being produced. And so we call this signal amplification. And what I mean by signal amplification is that, in theory, one hormone can bind to a receptor."
Health,"And that process can set off a chain reaction that leads to a lot of cAMP being produced. And so it can mean that less hormone is required to ultimately activate the protein or the effect that's being desired. And so secondary messengers are a means in which hormones act on the cell. But really, if I'm being honest, this effect happens differently for a lot of cells. And all of the mechanisms of secondary messenger hormone action aren't known right now."
Health,"And honestly, there are a lot of secondary messengers other than cAMP. But really, the takeaway is that for the majority of the hormones in your body, binding to the cell surface activates a series of reactions that initiate a response inside the cell. And so it's very similar to the use of a phone service provider."
Health,"And because we as people-- let me draw us-- because we're unable to communicate directly with people sometimes, because of separation or convenience or lack of efficiency, we use a phone service to project our voice to them through a phone conversation. So through a phone conversation, we'll direct our voice to people that we want to communicate with. Or maybe we use the delivery of a text message."
Health,"A text message will transmit some intended message that we have for people that we can't communicate directly with, for whatever reason. And so that's very similar to how secondary messengers assist hormones that can't communicate with a receptor directly inside of the cell. And so peptide hormones and catecholamines, both of which can't cross the cell membrane, use secondary messengers to communicate. And then the other major method of hormone action on a cell is as a primary messenger."
Health,"Certain hormones, like steroids and thyroid hormones, can actually cross the cell membrane. And it eliminates this entire middleman system that we set up before. So let me pull in another cell membrane. And so the hormone crosses the cell membrane and it binds to a receptor that's located either in the cytosol or in the nucleus. And so we could imagine a nucleus, and there might be DNA inside."
Health,"But when the hormone binds to the receptor that's either in the cytoplasm or inside the nucleus, that binding process is going to directly affect transcription in the nucleus, or translation in the cytoplasm, of the protein that's being activated by the hormone. And this process has quite a few less moving parts than the secondary messenger system did."
Health,"But again, it stems back to the fact that these are steroid and thyroid hormones that are typically lipid-based and are capable of crossing through the cell membrane on their own. And so they don't need all of that extra machinery set up for them. But anyway, these are both primary messengers and secondary messengers. And those are the two main processes by which hormones act on the cell that they're created to target.."
Health,"And, of course, this is kind of the perfect example. This isn't what all neurons look like. And then we're going to talk a little bit about how it performs its function, which is essentially communication, essentially transmitting signals across its length, depending on the signals it receives. So if I were to draw a neuron-- let me pick a better color. So let's say I have a neuron. It looks something like this. So in the middle you have your soma and then from the soma-- let me draw the nucleus."
Health,"This is a nucleus, just like any cell's nucleus. And then the soma's considered the body of the neuron and then the neuron has these little things sticking out from it that keep branching off. Maybe they look something like this. I don't want to spend too much time just drawing the neuron, but you've probably seen drawings like this before. And these branches off of the soma of the neuron, off of its body, these are called dendrites. They can keep splitting off like that."
Health,"I want to do a fairly reasonable drawing so I'll spend a little time doing that. So these right here, these are dendrites. And these tend to be-- and nothing is always the case in biology. Sometimes different parts of different cells perform other functions, but these tend to be where the neuron receives its signal. And we'll talk more about what it means to receive and transmit a signal in this video and probably in the next few. So this is where it receives the signal. So this is the dendrite."
Health,"This right here is the soma. Soma means body. This is the body of the neuron. And then we have kind of a-- you can almost view it as a tail of the neuron. It's called the axon. A neuron can be a reasonably normal sized cell, although there is a huge range, but the axons can be quite long. They could be short."
Health,"Sometimes in the brain you might have very small axons, but you might have axons that go down the spinal column or that go along one of your limbs-- or if you're talking about one of a dinosaur's limbs. So the axon can actually stretch several feet. Not all neurons' axons are several feet, but they could be. And this is really where a lot of the distance of the signal gets traveled. Let me draw the axon. So the axon will look something like this."
Health,"And at the end, it ends at the axon terminal where it can connect to other dendrites or maybe to other types of tissue or muscle if the point of this neuron is to tell a muscle to do something. So at the end of the axon, you have the axon terminal right there. I'll do my best to draw it like that. Let me label it. So this is the axon. This is the axon terminal."
Health,And you'll sometimes hear the word-- the point at which the soma or the body of the neuron connects to the axon is as often referred to as the axon hillock-- maybe you can kind of view it as kind of a lump. It starts to form the axon. And then we're going to talk about how the impulses travel. And a huge part in what allows them to travel efficiently are these insulating cells around the axon.
Health,"We're going to talk about this in detail and how they actually work, but it's good just to have the anatomical structure first. So these are called Schwann cells and they're covering-- they make up the myelin sheath. So this covering, this insulation, at different intervals around the axon, this is called the myelin sheath. So Schwann cells make up the myelin sheath. I'll do one more just like that."
Health,"And then these little spaces between the myelin sheath-- just so we have all of the terminology from-- so we know the entire anatomy of the neuron-- these are called the nodes of Ranvier. I guess they're named after Ranvier. Maybe he was the guy who looked and saw they had these little slots here where you don't have myelin sheath. So these are the nodes of Ranvier. So the general idea, as I mentioned, is that you get a signal here."
Health,"We're going to talk more about what the signal means-- and then that signal gets-- actually, the signals can be summed, so you might have one little signal right there, another signal right there, and then you'll have maybe a larger signal there and there-- and that the combined effects of these signals get summed up and they travel to the hillock and if they're a large enough, they're going to trigger an action potential on the axon, which will cause a signal to travel down the balance of the axon and then over here it might be connected via synapses to other dendrites or muscles."
Health,"And we'll talk more about synapses and those might help trigger other things. So you're saying, what's triggering these things here? Well, this could be the terminal end of other neurons' axons, like in the brain. This could be some type of sensory neuron. This could be on a taste bud someplace, so a salt molecule somehow can trigger it or a sugar molecule-- or this might be some type of sensor. It could be a whole bunch of different things and we'll talk more about the different types of neurons.."
Health,"Central and peripheral, and both of those are themselves divided into two main parts. The central nervous system is made up mostly of the brain which is in the head. So I'll just color that in here in magenta. And the spinal cord which is in the spine. So I'll just color that in in blue. That's this long thin tube-like structure that goes down the spine. Now the brain is divided into a bunch of different parts. And I'll just mention some of the big ones for this kind of introduction talk."
Health,"Here we're looking at the brain from the left side. All of this part on the top, that has several different colors here, is called the cerebrum. Cerebrum, which is the biggest part of the brain and the part on top. Now if we look down from the top, like in this drawing here, you can't see the parts underneath. You can only see the cerebrum and you see that it's divided into a left and a right half, and we call those halves the cerebral, or cerebral hemispheres. Cerebral hemispheres, like half a sphere."
Health,"And there's a left and a right cerebral hemisphere. Now on this picture over here, we're actually looking at the middle part of the brain, so it's like we've cut down the brain this way, and separated the left and the right cerebral hemisphere. So here we're looking at the left cerebral hemisphere, but we're looking at it from this direction."
Health,"And we see that all of this stuff on the top, is the cerebrum or one of the cerebral hemispheres, and then the part on the bottom, which is smaller, we divide into two other parts. So first let me just draw an outline around this part right here, and this is the part that hooks onto the spinal cord down here. And this part is called the brain stem."
Health,"Let me write that out, brain stem, which is all of this part right here that connects the cerebrum to the spinal cord that they've cut off down here on this picture. And then the brain stem itself is divided into three smaller parts. The very top part of the brain stem that connects to the cerebrum, is called the mid brain, mid brain. And the middle part that's just below the mid brain we call the pons, P-O-N-S, for pons."
Health,"Under the pons, and the part that actually connects to the spinal cord, is called the medulla, or medulla, or sometimes people use a longer name of medulla oblongata. And then the last part, but not the least part of the brain, is this big part in the back. It's behind the brain stem and connected to the brain stem. And this, we call the cerebellum. Cerebellum. Now sometimes brain structures are referred to by the names of the structure that they develop from in the embryo."
Health,"So here's a picture of the human embryo and it's developing it's brain here. And this very front part is called the fore brain or it has a longer name of prosencephalon. This part behind the fore brain is called the mid brain and it also has a longer name called the mesencephalon. And then the part behind the mid brain is called the hind brain, hind brain, and it also has a longer name of the rhombencephalon. So the fore brain is going to become the cerebrum. The mid brain is going to become the mid brain."
Health,"Just this part of the brain stem, up top. And then the hind brain will become the rest of the brain. The pons, the medulla, and the cerebellum. So just in case you hear people referring to structures in the brain by these names, that's where those names come from. They're from the developing nervous system. Here's a drawing of the spinal cord. This kind of long tube that runs down the spine. And there's a number of structures coming out of the spinal cord that I'll talk about next."
Health,"So those are the parts that make up most of the central nervous system, and everything that's not in the central nervous system we call the peripheral nervous system. And the central nervous system is called that because it's kind of in the center of the body and then the peripheral nervous system is called that because it's going to go out all over the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system consists of two types of structures. The first are called nerves."
Health,Let me just underline this nerve right here. And these are the long stringy structures that are going to go all over the body. And nerves carry the axons of neurons. The second main structure of the peripheral nervous system are called ganglion. Ganglion is singular and ganglia is plural. And ganglia are these lumps that are attached to nerves and they contain the somas of neurons.
Health,"Now let me just draw that a little differently over on this picture of the spinal cord that have these nerves coming out of it. So here's one of these lumps, one of these ganglia that contains the somas of some of the neurons in the peripheral nervous system and some of these axons traveling through these nerves are going to be carrying information in to the central nervous system from the periphery. So they're going to bring information in this way from out here in the periphery."
Health,"And when they do that, we call those afferent neurons, afferent neurons carry information in to the central nervous system. Now other neurons are going to have axons that carry information in the opposite direction. So they're going to carry information away from the central nervous system out into the periphery. And neurons whose axons carry information away from the central nervous system we call efferent neurons. Efferent neurons. Now there are lots of these nerves that are going all over the body."
Health,And you can divide them up in a few different ways. But we usually start by dividing them into the cranial nerves which are nerves that exit the skull or the cranium. So these nerves primarily come out of the brain and they're passing through the skull on their way between the central nervous system and the periphery or the peripheral nerves can be spinal nerves. And they're coming out of the spinal cord and passing through the spine on their way between the central nervous system and the periphery.
Health,"And I'll just draw a few of these, but there's actually lots of these. They're paired on both sides of the body. And there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 31 pairs of the spinal nerves. Now if we go back to our drawings of the spinal cord here, we can see that the spinal nerves actually form from these two parts which are called spinal nerve roots and there's a root in the front and there's a root in the back. And in this drawing we're looking from the back."
Health,"So here's the root in the back that have the ganglia and the way these spinal nerve roots work are that the afferent neurons bringing information into the central nervous system travel through the spinal nerve roots in the back and the efferent neurons that are carrying information away from the central nervous system travel in the spinal nerve roots in the front and then they come together in the spinal nerves, so we call those mixed nerves because they have a mix of afferent and efferent neurons usually."
Health,"Now as any of these nerves travel from their proximal origin, proximal just meaning close to the center of the body, toward their distal ends, the word distal just meaning far away from the center of the body, or you can think of the word distant, all the nerves are going to branch repeatedly, so they're going to branch, and then they'll branch, and then they'll branch again, and they'll just keep branching into tinier and tinier branches, because they have a long way to go and have to spread all the way out all the way through the body, and these proximal parts of the nerves are big nerves that we can see with the naked eye."
Health,"But once you get to these distal nerves, after they've branched a bunch of times, actually become microscopic, and they're little microscopic nerves that go all over the body connecting the entire body back to the central nervous system. And this is true for almost all of the cranial and the spinal nerves. Oh, I almost forgot here, I have this other drawing to show the cranial nerves."
Health,"Here's a drawing of the brain looking up from the bottom, and all of these long stingy looking things coming out of the brain are cranial nerves. They're going to pass through the skull on their way from the brain out into the periphery. I won't draw them all in here, but there are a bunch of these cranial nerves that are going to pass through the skull. So that's a brief kind of overview of the structure of the nervous system and there's a lot more to it of course."
Health,But I just want to give you an introduction here. And we'll get into some more of the details in later videos..
Health,"You could say the lower functions and the higher functions or the basic functions and the complex functions, but the reasons I like to use these words is that the basic functions aren't really that simple. They're actually fairly complex when you start to get into them, and they're not really lower in any particular way either. Really, you need the basic functions and the higher functions."
Health,"Now, dysfunction of different parts of the nervous system may cause different patterns of abnormalities of the functions of the nervous system, either the basic functions, the higher functions, or both, and patterns of abnormal functions we call syndromes."
Health,"Let me just write that word down, syndromes, which means patterns of abnormalities, and certain syndromes involving abnormal functions of the nervous system are more common than others, because they're caused by neurological or psychiatric disorders that occur more frequently. The basic functions of the nervous system are performed by many parts of both the central nervous system, which is mainly the brain and the spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which is mainly the nerves."
Health,"When it comes to the nerves, the cranial nerves primarily perform the basic functions of the head and the neck, whereas the spinal nerves primarily perform the basic functions for the limbs and the trunk, because that's where those nerves generally go. Now, I like to divide up the basic functions of the nervous system into three big categories. The first category I would call motor, and the word motor, in this context, refers to control of skeletal muscle."
Health,"So, skeletal muscle, the main muscle we have that's all over our body and attached to our skeleton, and by controlling skeletal muscle, the motor functions of the nervous system cause movement, tone, and posture, which are the end results of contraction of skeletal muscle. The next big category of basic functions of the nervous system I like to call sensory functions, and this involves all of the senses, basically anything that the nervous system can detect."
Health,"And we're used to hearing about five senses, but it actually turns out that if you kind of split them up into finer categories, there's way more than five senses. There's vision, there's hearing, smell, taste. There's a sense from the inner ear, called vestibular sense, and there's multiple senses of the body, called somatosensation, and somatosensation includes the senses of touch, the position of body parts, vibration, pain, temperature, and several others."
Health,"And for each of these categories, we'll get into a lot more detail on these in later videos, because there's really a lot going on within these categories."
Health,"And the third big category I think of, when I think of the basic functions of the nervous system, I like to call automatic functions, automatic, and these are things that don't require conscious involvement, and that includes a lot of different things, like reflexes, like when your doctor taps on your knee at the clinic, and your leg kicks out without you telling it to, and there's all sorts of different reflexes of the nervous system, and we'll go over a few of them in later videos, but there's also all sorts of other kind of automatic functions the nervous system does without requiring the involvement of consciousness, including control of a number of the body systems involved and really important things like circulation, respiration, and digestion."
Health,"So, more on that later too. But now, the higher functions of the nervous system are not performed by huge areas of both the central and the peripheral nervous system. The higher functions are performed by parts of the brain, and like the basic functions of the nervous system, I like to divide up the higher functions of the nervous system into three big categories."
Health,"The first big category of the higher functions of the nervous system I like to call cognition, cognition, and people use this word in a number of different ways, so it can get confusing when you're reading about cognition, but I like to think of this as kind of the thinking functions of the brain, like thinking, but there's also a whole bunch of other things that we can often put under this term of cognition, including things like learning and memory and language and a group of things we call the executive functions, which involve creating goals and organizing behavior to achieve those goals."
Health,"So, more on that later, because there's plenty going on there. The next big category of higher functions of the nervous system I call emotions, and emotions, of course, are our feelings, but it turns out there's a lot more to emotions than just kind of what we feel, because emotions play a major role in our experience of life and a lot of other functions of both the nervous system and the rest of the body."
Health,"And the last category I like to think of under the higher functions of the nervous system is consciousness, and consciousness is a really tough word to define. I don't know that I have a great definition, because people have been trying to come up with a definition everyone can agree with for quite some time, although we all sort of know what consciousness is."
Health,"The best I can probably come up with is that consciousness is related to the awareness of being a person, of experiencing one's life, and controlling one's actions, and while there's a lot we don't understand about how the nervous system does pretty much all of these functions or categories of functions that I've written out here, consciousness is the one we know the least about, where many many people are doing lots and lots of research to try to understand how this phenomenon of consciousness is created by the nervous system."
Health,"So, this is how I like to think about the functions of the nervous system and how I like to break them up into some big categories, and like I said, we'll go into the details of lots of these categories in later videos, and if you look in different textbooks and things, you'll see people have organized the functions of the nervous system in lots of different ways, and in some ways, it doesn't really matter how you organize all the different functions of the nervous system, as long as you find some system that makes sense to you, to keep track of it all.."
Health,"Neural cells are divided into two big categories. The first are neurons, which were traditionally called nerve cells. And the second are glia. Now, these can also be called neuroglia or glial cells. That all means the same thing. Neurons are named from a Greek word for nerve, while glia are named from a Greek word for glue, because they were once thought to do little except glue neurons together. The structure of the nervous system is divided into two main parts."
Health,"The first part is mainly made up of the brain in the head and the spinal cord in the spine. And this part of the nervous system is called the central nervous system. The other part of the nervous system is called the peripheral nervous system. And that's made up mostly of nerves, these long, stringy structures that come out of the brain and the spinal cord. And they go all over the body, like down into the arms, and down into the legs, and into every part of the body."
Health,And we'll cover a lot more in detail about neuroanatomy in other videos. But I just need to bring up the central and peripheral nervous system because the neural cells are divided up differently amongst the different systems. Calling neurons nerve cells is a little problematic because these structures in the peripheral nervous system called nerves are made up of neurons. But they also contain glial cells. And they contain a number of other cells that aren't neural cells at all.
Health,"However, you'll often hear people refer to neurons as nerve cells because that was the traditional name for them. Neurons are found both in the central nervous system, the brain and the spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, in the nerves. But the different types of glial cells are found only in one or the other. Most neural cells are derived from populations of cells called neural stem cells or neural crest cells."
Health,"And both of those cell types arise early in development in the part of the embryo called the ectoderm. Most neurons and glia found in the central nervous system are derived from neural stem cells, while most neurons and glia found in the peripheral nervous system are derived from neural crest cells. Now, we'll go into a lot more detail about what neural stem cells are and neural crest cells in other videos, when we cover development of the nervous system."
Health,"Most types of both neurons and glia share some structural features of the way their cell is shaped. Most of them have a main part to their cell called the soma or the cell body that contains the nucleus and most of the organelles. Coming out of the soma, most of these cell types have processes, long, thin extensions that come out of the soma."
Health,"And the processes of the different neural cells vary in number and in length, in thickness, and degree of branching, because some of them will be unbranched, and some of them will have processes that branch, sometimes a little and sometimes a lot. They will also vary a lot in the terminal structures at the end of their processes and the function of these structures and the processes. The function of neurons is to process and transmit information."
Health,And the function of glia is to support them in a variety of ways. There are many structural and functional types of both the neurons and the glia. And there are large numbers of these cells making up the nervous system. There are billions of neurons that form trillions of connections in the adult human nervous system. And there even more glia than there are neurons.
Health,"In subsequent videos, we'll go over the most common glia, which are astrocytes, microglia, ependymal cells, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells. There are also less common glia, such as satellite cells and olfactory and sheathing cells. But we'll just go over the most common types here.."
Health,"I just want to give a bird's eye overview of it. The function of neurons is to process and transmit information. Without input, most neurons have a stable electrical charge difference across their cell membrane, where it's more negative inside the cell membrane and more positive outside the cell membrane. And we call this the resting membrane potential or just resting potential for short. And this resting potential is really how the neuron is going to be able to be excitable and respond to input."
Health,"And I think of this as similar to loading a gun by putting a bullet in it. Neurons receive excitatory or inhibitory input from other cells or from physical stimuli like odorant molecules in the nose. Input information usually comes in through the dendrites. Although less often, it'll come in through the soma or the axon. The information from the inputs is transmitted through dendrites or the soma to the axon with membrane potential changes called graded potentials."
Health,"These graded potentials are changes to the membrane potential away from the resting potential, which are small in size and brief in duration, and which travel fairly short distances. The size and the duration of a graded potential is proportional to the size and the duration of the input. Summation, or an adding together of all the excitatory and inhibitory graded potentials at any moment in time occurs at the trigger zone, the axon initial segment right here."
Health,"This summation of graded potentials is the way neurons process information from their inputs. If the membrane potential at the trigger zone crosses a value called the threshold potential, information will then be fired down the axon. So I like to think of this process of summation of the excitatory and inhibitory graded potentials at the trigger zone as analogous to the trigger of a gun. In fact, that's why it's called the trigger zone."
Health,"I think of the graded potentials as being like the finger on the gun, that may be squeezing a little harder or relaxing. But once the trigger of the gun is pulled back past a certain threshold distance, a bullet will be fired down the barrel of the gun, just like if the membrane potential of the trigger zone crosses a threshold value, information will be fired down the axon. The way information is fired down the axon is with a different kind of change to the membrane potential called an action potential."
Health,"An action potential is usually large in size and brief in duration. But it's usually conducted the entire length of the axon, no matter how long it is, so that it can travel a very long distance, just like a bullet usually has no trouble making it down the barrel of the gun. And like a bullet traveling through the barrel of a gun, action potentials tend to travel very quickly down the length of the axon."
Health,"Action potentials are different than graded potentials because they're usually the same size and duration for any particular neuron, as opposed to the graded potentials, whose size and duration depends on the size and the duration of the inputs. Action potentials are conducted faster along larger axons, axons with a larger diameter, and along axons that have a myelin sheath, that I've drawn in yellow here."
Health,"When an action potential reaches the axon terminals at the end of the axon, information will then cross, usually a small gap, to the target cell of the neuron. And the way this happens for most synapses where an axon terminal makes contact with the target cell is by release of molecules called neurotransmitters that bind to receptors on the target cell and which may change its behavior. Neurotransmitter is then removed from the synapse. So it's reset to transmit more information."
Health,"And I think of this part as similar to the bullet leaving the gun, to hit the target. The input information that was converted into the size and the duration of graded potentials is then converted into the temporal pattern of firing of action potentials down the axon. And this information is then converted to the amount and the temporal pattern of neurotransmitter release at the synapse. These steps are how neurons transmit information, often over long distances."
Health,"This is the general way that neurons usually function. But there are multiple functional types of neurons. So let's take a look at some of those. Here I've drawn a few different neurons, with their somas in red, their axons in green, and their dendrites in blue. And I've drawn a line here to separate between the central nervous system on this side-- so I'll just write CNS for short-- and the peripheral nervous system on this side-- so I'll just write PNS for short."
Health,"And there's some different ways we can categorize functional types of neurons. The first way is the direction of information flow between the CNS and the PNS. If a neuron like this pseudounipolar neuron right here brings information from the periphery in toward the central nervous system, we call that an afferent neuron. Afferent, meaning it's bringing information into the central nervous system."
Health,"We can also call this type of neuron a sensory neuron because the information it's bringing into the central nervous system involves information about a stimulus. And a stimulus is anything that can be sensed in the internal or external environment, which is to say anything inside the body or anything outside the body. These neurons are carrying information away from the central nervous system out into the periphery. So instead of calling them afferent neurons, we call them efferent neurons."
Health,"And there are two main kinds of efferent neurons. The first we call motor neurons. Motor, which means movement. These are efferent neurons that control skeletal muscle, the main type of muscle that's attached to our skeleton, that moves us around. These motor neurons are also called somatomotor neurons or neurons of the somatic nervous system. The other type of the efferent neurons are called autonomic neurons."
Health,"And these neurons control smooth muscle, like the muscle around our blood vessels; cardiac muscle, the muscle of our heart; and gland cells, the cells of our glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream. These autonomic neurons are also called visceromotor neurons or neurons of the autonomic nervous system. Most neurons of the central nervous system aren't any of these types of neurons, however. They're like this neuron, in that they connect other neurons together."
Health,"So these are called interneurons, neurons between neurons. And there are many interneurons in the central nervous system, forming very complex pathways for information to travel. So that while an individual neuron is processing and transmitting information, these complex networks of neurons in the central nervous system are doing even more complex processing and transmitting of information.."
Health,"And then I'll draw the axon of the neuron in green. It's this long unbranched process, until it reaches the end, and then it branches into multiple terminals, and I'll just draw a few here, but it can have many, many terminals. And then let me just draw some target shapes to represent the types of target cells that a neuron may contact with the synapse."
Health,"And these cells may be another neuron, they might be a muscle cell, or they may be a gland cell, and some neurons even have axon terminals that end on blood vessels to secrete substances into the bloodstream, called hormones."
Health,"So synapses are these spots, where the axon terminals of a neuron are contacting their target cell, and there are a couple of types of synapses, one of which has a gap like I've drawn here, although it's actually a much smaller gap than I've drawn, and the other one doesn't have a gap. They are physically connected."
Health,"The type of synapse that has a gap is called a chemical synapse, because it releases molecules, or chemicals, at the synapse that cross from the axon terminal to the membrane of the target cell. The other type of synapse is called an electrical synapse."
Health,"And with this type of synapse, the cells are actually physically connected, so that the axon terminal physically connects with the membrane of the target cell, and there are special channels called ""gap junctions"" that actually let the inside of the neuron communicate with the inside of the target cell. The cytoplasm of the two are really connected, and ions can flow directly from the neuron into the target cell."
Health,"In this set of videos, I'm just gonna talk about the chemical synapses, where there is a gap, because they are far and away more common than electrical synapses, which are fairly rare, at least in humans. Now a typical human neuron can have a massive number of connections through synapses. It can connect thousands of different target cells through its axon terminals, and the typical neuron receives information through thousands of synapses."
Health,"Most of those synapses come in to the dendrites, so that the axon of another neuron is contacting and communicating with the dendrite of this neuron, and there could be many, many synapses on a dendrite, and part of the reason it's branched, is just so that it can have more surface area, to form more synapses. So that for most neurons, most of the synapses are actually coming in through their dendrites. However most neurons also do get a smaller number of synapses coming in to the soma."
Health,"And there are even synapses onto the axon, but usually not just anywhere onto the axon, it's usually onto the axon terminal, so that this axon comes in, and its axon terminal is synapsing on the axon terminal of this neuron. And it could be the same with this axon terminal, it could have synapses, and this axon terminal right here. And so try to imagine thousands of synapses just literally covering this whole neuron, and that it in turn is connecting with thousands of target cells through synapses."
Health,"And you can just imagine how complex the information is that's flowing into and out of the neuron from other parts of the nervous system. But now let's zoom in, and let's look at the structure of an individual synapse, like for instance this synapse right here."
Health,"Let me start by drawing a big axon terminal, so I'll just blow up that axon terminal and make it really big here in green, and then I'll just draw a target type of shape to represent the target cell, which again could be another neuron, could be a muscle cell, or it could be a gland cell. And then in the central nervous system, covering most of the synapses are the end feet of astrocytes."
Health,"Now let me just draw that in purple, and I'll actually just label that, let me just write ""astrocyte,"" and this would be one of the end feet of the astrocyte that, in the central nervous system are just plastered all over synapses. So for a chemical synapse like this, there is a gap here, between the membrane of the axon terminal of the neuron, and the membrane of the target cell. And the gap is actually much smaller than this, but I just needed a little room to draw."
Health,"It's a very, very small gap, but the cells are not actually physically touching each other. There is a gap. And we call this gap the synaptic cleft. Let me just write that out - synaptic cleft. And that's the space between the neuron and the target cell, and then we have names for this piece of membrane over here, and this piece of membrane."
Health,"This membrane facing the synaptic cleft, on the axon terminal of the neuron, we call the presynaptic membrane, presynaptic membrane is right here, because it's before the synaptic cleft. And then this piece of membrane on the target cell facing the synaptic cleft is the postsynaptic membrane, postsynaptic membrane, and that's right over here. And so it's presynaptic because it's before the synaptic cleft, and it's postsynaptic because it's after the synaptic cleft."
Health,"Just on the inside of the presynaptic membrane are vesicles, which are little membrane-enclosed bubbles inside the cytoplasm of the neuron, and these are called synaptic vesicles. Synaptic vesicles - that's each of these bubble-like structures just inside the presynaptic membrane of the neuron. And these synaptic vesicles are full of molecules called neurotransmitter."
Health,"Let's draw a couple of dots in here to represent these molecules, and they are called collectively neurotransmitter, because they transmit information from the neuron to the target cells, and all of these molecules are collectively called neurotransmitters. And there are different types of neurotransmitters, that we'll get into on other videos. On the postsynaptic membrane are receptors that are specific for the neurotransmitter in the synaptic vesicles."
Health,"The neurotransmitter will fit like a key in a lock to these neurotransmitter receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. And in the next video we'll talk about how the neurotransmitter and the synaptic vesicles is released from the presynaptic membrane to cross the synaptic cleft, and bind to its receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.."
Health,"That's probably the trigger. That channel allows ions to be released into the cell-- or actually, there are situations where ions can be released out of the cell. It would be inhibitory, but let's take the case where ions are released into the cells in an electrotonic fashion."
Health,"It changes the charge or the voltage gradient across the membrane and if the combined effects of the change in the voltage gradient is just enough at the axon hillock to meet that threshold, then the sodium channels over here will open up, sodium floods in, and then we have the situation where the voltage becomes very positive. Potassium channels open up to change things again, but by the time we went very positive, then that eletrotonically affects the next sodium pump."
Health,"But then we have the situation where that will allow sodium ions to flood in and then the signal keeps getting transmitted. Now the next natural question is, what happens at the neuron to neuron junctions? We said that this dendrite gets triggered or gets excited. In most cases, it's getting triggered or excited by another neuron. It could be something else. And over here, when this axon fires, it should be exciting either another cell."
Health,"It could be a muscle cell or-- in probably most cases of the human body-- it's exciting another neuron. And so how does it do that? So this is the terminal end of the axon. There could be the dendrite of another neuron right here. This is another neuron with its own axon, its own cell. This would trigger the dendrite right there."
Health,"So the question is, how does that happen? How does the signal go from one neuron's axon to the next neuron's dendrite? It actually always doesn't have to go from axon to dendrite, but that's the most typical. You can actually go from axon to axon, dendrite to dendrite, axon to soma-- but let's just focus on axon to dendrite because that's the most traditional way that neurons transmit information from one to the other. So let's zoom in. Let's zoom in right here."
Health,"This little box right there, let's zoom at the base, the terminal end of this axon and let's zoom in on this whole area. Then we'll also zoom in-- we're also going to get the dendrite of this next neuron-- and I'm going to rotate it. Actually, I don't even have to rotate it. So to do that, let me draw the terminal end. So let's say the terminal end looks something like this. I'm zoomed in big time. This is the terminal end of the neuron."
Health,"This is inside the neuron and then the next dendrite-- let me draw it right here. So we've really zoomed in. So this is the dendrite of the next neuron. This is inside the first neuron. So we have this action potential that keeps traveling along. Eventually for maybe right over here-- I don't know if you can zoom in-- which would be over here, the action potential makes the electrical potential or the voltage potential across this membrane just positive enough to trigger this sodium channel."
Health,"So actually, maybe I'm really close. This channel is this one right here. So then it allows a flood of sodium to enter the cell. And then the the whole thing happens. You have potassium that can then take it out, but by the time this comes in, this positive charge, it can trigger another channel and it could trigger another sodium channel if there's other sodium channels further down, but near the end of the axon there are actually calcium channels. I'll do that in pink."
Health,"So this is a calcium channel that is traditionally closed. So this is a calcium ion channel. Calcium has a plus 2 charge. It tends to be closed, but it's also voltage gated. When the voltage gets high enough, it's very similar to a sodium voltage gated channel is that if it becomes positive enough near the gate, it will open up and when it opens up, it allows calcium ions to flood into the cell. So the calcium ions, their plus 2 charge, to flood into the cells."
Health,"Now you're saying, hey Sal, why are calcium ions flooding into the cells? These have positive charge. I just thought you said that the cell is becoming positive because of all the sodium flowing in."
Health,"Why would this calcium want to flow in? And the reason why it wants to flow in is because the cell also-- just like it pumps out sodium and pumps in potassium, the cell also has calcium ion pumps and the mechanism is nearly identical to what I showed you on the sodium potassium pump, but it just deals with calcium. So you literally have these proteins that are sitting across the membrane. This is a phospobilipid layer membrane. Maybe I'll draw two layers here just so you realize it's a bi-layer membrane."
Health,"Let me draw it like that. That makes it look a little bit more realistic, although the whole thing is not very realistic. And this is also going to be a bilipid membrane. You get the idea, but let me just do it to make the point clear. So there are also these calcium ion pumps that are also subsets of ATPases, which they're just like the sodium potassium pumps."
Health,"You give them one ATP and a calcium will bond someplace else and it'll pull apart the phosphate from the ATP and that'll be enough energy to change the confirmation of this protein and it'll push the calcium out. Essentially, what was the calcium will bond and then it'll open up so the calcium can only exit the cell. It's just like the sodium potassium pumps, but it's good to know in the resting state, you have a high concentration of calcium ions out here and it's all driven by ATP."
Health,"A much higher concentration on the outside than you have on the inside and it's driven by those ion pumps. So once you have this action potential, instead of triggering another sodium gate, it starts triggering calcium gates and these calcium ions flood into the terminal end of this axon. Now, these calcium ions, they bond to other proteins. And before I go to those other proteins, we have to keep in mind what's going on near this junction right here."
Health,"And I've used the word synapse already-- actually, maybe I haven't. The place where this axon is meeting with this dendrite, this is the synapse. Or you can kind of view it as the touching point or the communication point or the connection point. And this neuron right here, this is called the presynaptic neuron. Let me write that down. It's good to have a little terminology under our belt. This is the post-synaptic neuron."
Health,"And the space between the two neurons, between this axon and this dendrite, this is called the synaptic cleft. It's a really small space in the terms of-- so what we're going to deal with in this video is a chemical synapse. In general, when people talk about synapses, they're talking about chemical synapses. There also are electrical synapses, but I won't go into detail on those. This is kind of the most traditional one that people talk about."
Health,"So your synaptic cleft in chemical synapses is about 20 nanometers, which is really small. If you think about the average width of a cell as about 10 to 100 microns-- this micron is 10 to the minus 6. This is 20 times 10 to the minus 9 meters. So this is a very small distance and it makes sense because look how big the cells look next to this small distance. So it's a very small distance and you have-- on the presynaptic neuron near the terminal end, you have these vesicles. Remember what vesicles were."
Health,"These are just membrane bound things inside of the cell. So you have these vesicles. They also have their phospobilipid layers, their little membranes. So you have these vesicles so these are just-- you can kind of view them as containers. I'll just draw one more just like that. And they can train these molecules called neurotransmitters and I'll draw the neurotransmitters in green. So they have these molecules called neurotransmitters in them. You've probably heard the word before."
Health,"In fact, a lot of drugs that people use for depression or other things related to our mental state, they affect neurotransmitters. I won't go into detail there, but they contain these neurotransmitters. And when the calcium channels-- they're voltage gated-- when it becomes a little more positive, they open calcium floods in and what the calcium does is, it bonds to these proteins that have docked these vesciles."
Health,"So these little vesicles, they're docked to the presynpatic membrane or to this axon terminal membrane right there. These proteins are actually called SNARE proteins. It's an acronym, but it's also a good word because they've literally snared the vesicles to this membrane. So that's what these proteins are."
Health,"And when these calcium ions flood in, they bond to these proteins, they attach to these proteins, and they change the confirmation of the proteins just enough that these proteins bring these vesicles closer to the membrane and also kind of pull apart the two membranes so that the membranes merge. Let me do a zoom in of that just to make it clear what's going on."
Health,"So after they've bonded-- this is kind of before the calcium comes in, bonds to those SNARE proteins, then the SNARE protein will bring the vesicle ultra-close to the presynaptic membrane. So that's the vesicle and then the presynaptic membrane will look like this and then you have your SNARE proteins. And I'm not obviously drawing it exactly how it looks in the cell, but it'll give you the idea of what's going on."
Health,"Your SNARE proteins have essentially pulled the things together and have pulled them apart so that these two membranes merge. And then the main side effect-- the reason why all this is happening-- is it allows those neurotransmitters to be dumped into the synaptic cleft. So those neurotransmitters that were inside of our vesicle then get dumped into the synaptic cleft. This process right here is called exocytosis. It's exiting the cytoplasm, you could say, of the presynaptic neuron."
Health,"These neurotransmitters-- and you've probably heard the specific names of many of these-- serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine-- which is also adrenaline, but that's also a hormone, but it also acts as a neurotransmitter. Norepinephrine, also both a hormone and a neurotransmitter. So these are words that you've probably heard before. But anyway, these enter into the synaptic cleft and then they bond on the surface of the membrane of the post-synaptic neuron or this dendrite."
Health,"Let's say they bond here, they bond here, and they bond here. So they bond on special proteins on this membrane surface, but the main effect of that is, that will trigger ion channels. So let's say that this neuron is exciting this dendrite. So when these neurotransmitters bond on this membrane, maybe sodium channels open up. So maybe that will cause a sodium channel to open up. So instead of being voltage gated, it's neurotransmitter gated."
Health,"So this will cause a sodium channel to open up and then sodium will flow in and then, just like we said before, if we go to the original one, that's like this getting excited, it'll become a little bit positive and then if it's enough positive, it'll electrotonically increase the potential at this point on the axon hillock and then we'll have another neuron-- in this case, this neuron being stimulated. So that's essentially how it happens. It actually could be inhibitory."
Health,"You could imagine if this, instead of triggering a sodium ion channel, if it triggered a potassium ion channel. If it triggered a potassium ion channel, potassium ion's concentration gradient will make it want to go outside of the cell. So positive things are going to leave the cell if it's potassium. Remember, I used triangles for potassium."
Health,"And so if positive things leave the cell, then if you go further down the neuron, it'll become less positive and so it'll be even harder for the action potential to start up because it'll need even more positive someplace else to make the threshold gradient. I hope I'm not confusing you when I say that. So this connection, the way I first described it, it's exciting. When this guy gets excited from an action potential, calcium floods in."
Health,"It makes these vesicles dump their contents in the synaptic cleft and then that will make other sodium gates open up and then that will stimulate this neuron, but if it makes potassium gates open up, then it will inhibit it-- and that's how, frankly, these synapses work. I was about to say there's millions of synapses, but that'd be incorrect. There's trillions of synapses. The best estimate of the number of synapses in our cerebral cortex is 100 to 500 trillion synapses just in the cerebral cortex."
Health,"The reason why we can have so many is that one neuron can actually form many, many, many, many synapses. I mean, you can imagine if this original drawing of a cell, you might have a synapse here, a synapse here, a synapse there. You could have hundreds or thousands of synapses even, into one neuron or going out of one neuron. This might be a synapse with one neuron, another one, another one, another one. So you'd have many, many, many, many, many connections."
Health,"And so synapses are really what give us the complexity of what probably make us tick in terms of our human mind and all of that. But anyway, hopefully you found this useful.."
Health,"I'm gonna mention a bunch of chemistry terms next. Don't worry about them if you don't know them but if you are interested there are many great videos on these topics on the Khan Academy. The first category of neurotransmitters I'm gonna represent with these three neurotransmitters right here and this category is the amino acids. Amino acid neurotransmitters. Amino acids. That's these three right here. Amino acids have an amino group, this guy right here and they have a carboxylic acid group."
Health,"This part right here. There are lots of different types of amino acids but just a few of them function as neurotransmitters in the nervous system. The next category of neurotransmitters I'm gonna represent with this one right here and these are the peptides. Peptide neurotransmitters and I'll just have this one representative here. Peptides are actually polymers or chains of amino acids. A bunch of these amino acids get strung together in these chains, these polymers and we call them peptides."
Health,"Peptides are much larger molecules than all the other types of neurotransmitters. Sometimes people divide up neurotransmitters just into peptides and they lump together all the other neurotransmitters and call them small molecule neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters in this row will represent our next big category which are the monomines. Monoamine neurotransmitters, monoamines. That's this whole row. I've picked out five representative neurotransmitters for the monoamines."
Health,"These are also sometimes called biogenic amines. Either monoamines or biogenic amines. The monoamines are organic molecules with an amino group here and here and here, here and here connected to an aromatic group here, here, here, here and here. The amino group and aromatic group are connected by a two carbon chain, this part here and here and here, here and here. Some of the monoamines, these three."
Health,"Draw little stars next to these three, are also called by a different name and that name, and let me draw a little star. That name is the catecholamines. Catecholamines. Catecholamines are a subgroup of the monoamines and the catecholamines have a catachol group which is this part right here which has a benzine, this ring and two hydroxyl groups. Here's one hydroxyl group and here's another hydroxyl group. This catechol group, all the catecholamines have this group these three right here."
Health,There are many other types of neurotransmitters that are not amino acids or monoamines or peptides and this neurotransmitter right here is gonna be the representative for that. I'll just call this category other. These are the other molecular types of neurotransmitters. Now I'm gonna introduce some important neurotransmitters in these different groups and I'm gonna mention some of their functions.
Health,Don't worry too much about their functions right now because they do so many different things in different parts of the nervous system that we'll come back to all of that in other videos. I just want to briefly introduce the different important neurotransmitters in each of these classes. Starting with the amino acids. Important amino acid neurotransmitters are this one which is called glutamate. Glutamate. This one which is called gamma-aminobutryic acid which pretty much everybody just shortens to GABA.
Health,G-A-B-A for gamma-aminobutryic acid. This one which is glycine. Glycine. Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter of the nervous system. Let me just draw a big plus sign above glutamate here because most of the time in the nervous system when a neuron is releasing a neurotransmitter that it's exciting its target cell most of the time that neurotransmitter is glutamate because it usually causes depolarization of target cells so that it excites them.
Health,"GABA and glycine are the most common inhibitory neurotransmitters of the nervous system. Let me just write some big minus signs above GABA and glycine because they usually cause hyper polarization of target cells and inhibit those target cells. GABA is the most common inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain while glycine is the most common inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord, so that the amino acid neurotransmitters are really involved in most functions of the nervous system."
Health,"Pretty much if you think of anything the nervous system is doing at some point in the chains and networks of neurons glutamate, GABA and/or glycine are probably involved in moving information through those networks. There are many important monoamine neurotransmitters but I'm just gonna mention these five that are arguably the most important. The first one here is serotonin. Serotonin. The next one here is histamine. Histamine. The next one is called dopamine. Dopamine. Then this one is epinephrine."
Health,"Epinephrine. Right next to epinephrine is its close cousin norepinephrine. Norepinephrine. All five of these are monoamine neurotransmitters but these three dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine are also called catecholamines. The monoamines play a lot of different functions in the nervous system and in particular a lot of functions of the brain including big things like consciousness, inattention and cognition or thinking, and emotions or us having feelings."
Health,"Norepinephrine is also released by some autonomic neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Many disorders of the nervous system involve abnormalities of these monoamine neurotransmitters systems, and many drugs that people commonly take affect the monoamine neurotransmitters. There are many important peptide neurotransmitters including a group of peptide neurotransmitters called the opioids. Opioids. The opioids are a group within the bigger group of the peptide neurotransmitters."
Health,This one is one example of an opioid. This is endorphin. Endorphin. The peptide neurotransmitters play a role in many functions of the nervous system but the opioids in particular play a big role in our perception of pain. A number of pain medications affect the opioid neurotransmitters. Last but definitely not least are the other neurotransmitters.
Health,"Usually when there's an other category of anything that means it's not very important but in the case of neurotransmitters there are some really important neurotransmitters that are not amino acids, monoamines or peptides. For example, this neurotransmitter right here is called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is definitely one of our most important neurotransmitters."
Health,"It does a number of functions in the central nervous system, and then in the peripheral nervous system it's released by most neurons in the autonomic nervous system. Let me just right ANS for autonomic nervous system and it's released by neurons called motor neurons that synapse on skeletal muscle and tell our skeletal muscle to contract to make us move."
Health,"Again, don't worry too much about these functions because in other videos we'll go more into the structure and the function of the nervous system and talk about specific neurotransmitter pathways. I just wanted to introduce the different types of neurotransmitters here and start to give you a feel for the huge variety of functions all these different neurotransmitters have in the nervous system.."
Health,"When the target cell is another neuron, excitatory or inhibitory synapses can be scattered around all over the surface of the neuron. Or there are many neurons where the dendrites are receiving predominately excitatory synapses so that there can be a large number of neurons synapsing on the dendrites and releasing neurotransmitters that will cause depolarizations in the dendrites. So let me just draw little purple pluses in here to represent that these are excitatory synapses."
Health,And then many neurons like this will have more inhibitory synapses on the soma. So I'll just draw some little orange minus signs here to represent that these could be inhibitory synapses on the soma. And then often neurons have synapses on their axon terminals so that other axon terminals are synapsing on the axon terminal of the target neuron and these will often be a mix of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. And there's a big variety in how the synapses are set up on neurons.
Health,"And there would be a mix of some excitatory and inhibitory synapses at all these locations. But for neurons that are set up like this, kind of a general way of thinking about how information would flow to the neuron is that they can receive lots of excitatory input through the dendrites, causing depolarizations to spread down the dendrites into the soma. But then if these neurons are inhibiting the soma, that can block those depolarizations from reaching the trigger zone to trigger an action potential."
Health,"And then when action potentials are conducted from the trigger zone down the axon to the axon terminal, the excitatory and inhibitory synapses on the axon terminal can increase or decrease the amount of neurotransmitter that is released when an action potential reaches the axon terminal."
Health,"So that there can be fine tuning of the output of the neuron at multiple levels all the way from the dendrites through the soma and to the actual individual axon terminals, can have their output turned up or turned down in response to the information flowing in from all these synapses. So that one way you can categorize synapses is if they're predominately excitatory or predominately inhibitory."
Health,But there are some other big differences in neurotransmitter receptors and how they pass information from neurotransmitters in the chemical synapse to the target cell. So let me just draw a big axon terminal here that's releasing neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. And this will be the post synaptic membrane of the target cell. And I'm gonna draw the two big types of neurotransmitter receptors here. Let me draw this one in grey with its little receptor to bind to the neurotransmitter.
Health,"And I'll draw this other one in yellow over here with its little pocket to bind to its neurotransmitter. So this first type of neurotransmitter receptor is called ionotropic. And ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors are ligand gated ion channels. So they have ion right in the name. And when their ligand binds to their receptor, which in this case is their neurotransmitter, they open and allow certain ions to pass."
Health,"And when the neurotransmitter leaves the receptor, then they close and they don't let ions pass through anymore. The ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors cause graded potentials when they're activated, which have a rapid effect on the potential of the near by membrane that is brief and local."
Health,"The target cell will usually be excited if the activated ionotropic neurotransmitter receptor allows sodium or calcium ions to pass because they will usually flow into the neuron, bringing their positive charges in and causing depolarization. Or the ionotropic neurotransmitter receptor will usually cause inhibition of the target cell if it allows chloride or potassium ions to pass."
Health,"Chloride ions will usually flow into the neuron, bringing negative charges in, making it more negative inside and potassium ions will usually flow out of the neuron, carrying their positive charges outside and also making it more negative inside. Now the other big class of neurotransmitter receptors are called metabotropic. And these are not ion channels. Instead, when their neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, they activate second messengers inside the neuron."
Health,"And there are a number of different types of second messenger systems that can be activated by metabotopic neurotransmitter receptors. And these second messengers can do a lot of different things. They can go and effect the behavior of ion channels, causing them to be more or less active. Or they can change the activity of proteins inside the neuron. And some can even effect the activity of genes and change the pattern of gene expression inside of neurons."
Health,"When these metabotropic neurotransmtter receptors are activated, the response of the target cell occurs more slowly than it does with activation of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors, but the effects may be larger and they may be more widespread because there can be amplification through these second messenger systems."
Health,"The effects of activation of these second messenger systems by metabotropic receptors may involve just brief excitation or inhibition of the target cell, or it may cause longer lasting changes to how the target cell behaves, either when it's at rest or when it's responding to input.."
Health,"That food that you just took in was a part of the outside world, and the tract that it's going to follow in through from your mouth till the point that you expel it in the bathroom is actually not you. That's the external environment. How weird is that? So in this video, we're going to do an overview of the gastrointestinal tract."
Health,"I'll talk about each of the individual parts and what they're main, overall functions are, and then in subsequent videos I'll go through each of these individual parts and give a more detailed explanation of how they do what they do. All right, so starting off, of course, the first place our food is ever going to go to is our mouth, or the oral cavity. The main functions that we have achieved in the mouth include chewing, the morcellation of food. Also very important is hydrolysis."
Health,"As you might recall from biochemistry, hydrolysis is just the enzymatic digestion or the enzymatic breakdown. Where chewing is the physical breakdown, hydrolysis is the enzyme-assisted breakdown of food. So as we break down food, the goal here is to make what's called a bolus, just a sphere of digested food that can then be swallowed and passed on into our next structure. After we swallow the food, where do you think it goes? This guy right here, and that's the esophagus, the esophagus."
Health,"This, I think, is one of the more boring parts of the GI tract, because all we do here is just propel our bolus. We just pass it on down to the next guy. We don't even really do anything to it. Kind of boring. But the next guy is a little more exciting. Now we get to the stomach. A lot of action going on in the stomach, one of my favorite parts of the GI tract."
Health,"The stomach is responsible for multiple things, including churning, which is a lot like chewing, except that there are sort of more dimensions of contraction affecting the food and breaking it down. We also have hydrolysis going on here, the enzyme-assisted breakdown of food. In addition to that, you can store food in your stomach if it's not time to pass it on to the next component of your GI tract. The overall goal here is to make what's called chyme."
Health,"So we take our bolus, and we sort of melt it down, per se, into this more fluid type of substance that we can pass on to our intestines. So we're moving on now to our intestines. Starting now from about this point right here, we get our duodenum, and then this kind of circulates around here, and then we end up at this point. Everything in between, I'll draw it way out here, I'm just going to group together for right now as the small intestine. The small intestine."
Health,"There are three parts to this, and we'll talk about that in a subsequent video, but the main functions that we achieve here are hydrolysis, and also the absorption of nutrients. Notice this is kind of the first part of your GI tract that you're finally taking in some of the break down food products, and using them for nutrition to make other products in your body. Great."
Health,"Now that we have gone through the small intestine, what do you think shows up next? Starting from after the small intestine ended, all the way through this lined structure right here, we are going to be passing through the large intestine. The large intestine. Do you guys remember the other name for the large intestine? It starts with a C. If you said ""colon,"" absolutely right."
Health,"The colon is also one of the more boring parts of the GI tract, because really all we have going on here is absorption, but not of nutrients per se, more like things like water, or ions, or vitamin K, just things like that are absorbed in the large intestine, so not a very high yield place for acquiring nutrients. Then after that, we're going to pass food on to this structure here. This is called the rectum. The rectum."
Health,"Kind of like the stomach of the GI tract, the rectum serves for storage, We hold on to our processed food, if we can call it that anymore at this point, and it's held there until we deem it an appropriate time to expel the food. So when it's time to expel the food, it'll come out through the anus, through expulsion, expulsion. So those are all the key components of our gastrointestinal tract."
Health,"There are some other accessory organs that are involved here in digestion, and I'll have videos that talk about them as well. Those include things like the liver, the gallbladder, the pancreas, and those will come up in subsequent videos.."
Health,"So, the first thing we do is we chew our food, and this is something we're very familiar with. There's a very fancy scientific term for chewing, and it's called to masticate or mastication. That's just to chew your food, and there are two things in our mouth that allow us to chew. First, of course, are our teeth, and we'll talk about these extensively in another video, and the second is our tongue. The tongue, as you know, sits right here, and it has a fancy name as well, which would be important to know."
Health,"It's called the lingula, the lingula, and that will come in handy in a little bit. The tongue is made up of two types of muscles. There are extrinsic muscles that sit outside of the tongue and anchor into the tongue, and there are also intrinsic muscles, and intrinsic muscles are those that only sit within the body of the tongue. They are only located in here. Extrinsic muscles let us do things like elevate or raise the tip of our tongue, and the opposite, depress or lower the tip of our tongue."
Health,"It lets us protrude our tongue out of our mouth, and it also allows us to retract our tongue back into the mouth. On the other hand, intrinsic muscles, because they're only located within the body of the tongue, will change the size of the tongue as it contracts."
Health,"So, there are types of muscles that can shorten and widen your tongue, and these are ones that run from the tip of the tongue to the back of your mouth, and so we'll say they run anterior (A) to posterior, and then there are also muscles in your tongue that can allow it to lengthen, lengthen and narrow, so, narrow because we're pulling the tongue out, and these are ones that run from your right side to the left side of your mouth, or side-to-side, So, we'll write right to left over here."
Health,"All right, awesome, so after we've accomplished mastication, what's the next step? Well, the next step is that we break down the food particles by hydrolysis, and hydrolysis, as you might recall, is a process where enzymes break down macromolecules. Now, the enzymes that cause hydrolysis in our mouth come from glands, and there are a bunch of glands that sit in our mouth, and we'll talk about which ones."
Health,"They each contribute a certain component of our saliva, that we'll talk about right here, and they do different things. So, one, our glands can primarily release serous content, so serous content means things that are rich in enzymes, enzymes and salts, all right. So, we'll focus on enzymes. The other type of content our glands can release are mucinous things."
Health,"So, mucinous things which are mainly composed of mucin, which you might recall is sort of the same way we spell mucus, and the whole point of mucin is to wet the food, to make it easier to wrap up into a bolus and send to the back of our mouth to swallow. Enzymes, on the other hand, and I'll clarify this right here, will cut the food, will break it down by hydrolysis. So, the first gland I'll mention is the largest gland that we have."
Health,"They're called the parotid glands, and they sit on the side of your mouth, right above the jawbone, and these release about 25 percent of what's in saliva, and because they're green, they're mainly serous, so they contain enzymes, and we'll talk about which enzymes in a second."
Health,"The next type of gland that we have is kind of a mouthful, these are submandibular, submandibular glands, and these guys release about 70 percent of saliva, and they sit, as the name suggests, below the mandible, which is the jaw bone, and these are also mainly serous, but they certainly have some mucinous stuff that they release as well."
Health,"So, the next gland that we have is called the sublingual gland, and just like the name suggests, this guy sits right below our tongue, or our lingula, as we just learned that term, and it makes up about five percent of our saliva, and as the color suggests, it mainly releases mucin. It does release some enzyme but less so than the mucinous stuff. And then finally, the last gland that we have that contributes to hydrolysis in our mouth is called Von Ebner's gland."
Health,"So, Von Ebner's gland, which releases less than five percent of our salivary content, so very little. These guys are mainly located at the tip of our tongue, and what's special about Von Ebner's gland is that they release an enzyme called lingual lipase."
Health,"Lingual lipase, which as the name suggests, break down lipids, or more specifically, triglycerides, and these triglycerides are broken down into free fatty acids, so free fatty acids, as well as diglycerides or monoglycerides, So, I'll just write DG and MG for diglyceride and monoglyceride, and so that's what Von Ebner's does, and that's why that's unique."
Health,"The other three all release, to some extent, an enzyme that's called alpha-amylase, alpha-amylase, which is an enzyme that will take carbohydrates, like starch, which is just a big stack or chunk of carbohydrates, and break it down into smaller carbs. So, I'll just write smaller carbs here."
Health,"So, it'll break starch down into smaller carbs, to help with digestion, and when I say digestion, I should clarify that the amount of hydrolysis or the extent of breakdown that we have from these enzymes here and also from the cutting of food is very insufficient for absorption of nutrients. The only reason that we actually have digestion occur by enzymes in the mouth is for taste."
Health,"When we break down our starch, and when we break down our lipids, that helps us really appreciate some of the fats in our burgers or some of the sugar that's in our sodas. The problem, though, is when we have too much sugar in our mouth, because the mouth likes to sit around at a pH of about 7.0, pretty neutral, but when we have a lot of sugar, as you know, there are a bunch of hydroxyl groups that sit on your glucose molecules."
Health,"Hydroxyl groups can be acidic, and if we drop the pH down to something like less than pH of 5.5, we can actually start to demineralize or break down teeth, because of the acidic nature of your mouth, and so I'm going to keep that in mind next time I reach for a soda.."
Health,"And kind of where I've drawn the lines, as well, there are sphincters that sit to make sure food only flows in one way. Up here, we have the upper esophageal sphincter. Esophageal sphincter. And so, just to reiterate, a sphincter is just a circular localization of muscle, so just a bunch of muscle that sits in a ring right here, that makes sure that it's closed unless we tell that muscle to relax so we can pass food along."
Health,"And so, when I say that we're going to tell the muscle to relax, that implies then, that this muscle here, is under our control. So it's composed primarily of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle, so it's under voluntary control. And down here, I'll draw a squiggly line, we have the lower esophageal sphincter. So this is a little tricky because we call it a sphincter, you know, it smells like a sphincter, looks like a sphincter, but it doesn't actually work like a sphincter."
Health,"So it's sort of, I guess, a scientific joke, if you'd like to call it that. Because we don't have a ring of muscle that sits here that opens and closes whenever our body deems it's an appropriate time to. What do we have instead? Well, we actually have a sheet that kind of sits right here. There's a sheet of muscle that lines the connection between the thoracic cavity and the abdominal cavity."
Health,"So you can imagine that you have a thoracic cavity above, Things that would sit here would be your lungs and your heart. And then below, and I'll draw that right here, you have an abdominal cavity. So the abdominal cavity that's gonna have most of the GI tract. And this muscle that we have, that sits here, that's going to be the diaphragm. You've probably heard of this. This is voluntary skeletal muscle that contracts to pull downwards to help us breathe. When it moves downward, the lungs inflate with air."
Health,"So the diaphragm sits here and it actually makes a ring around this lower esophageal sphincter. And the diaphragm is actually lower esophageal sphincter because it just sits there holding the esophagus in place. And that's why over time, we can have what's called a hiatal hernia. The esophagus can move upward and downward through this lower esophageal sphincter and we'll have gastric acid from the stomach reflux upward and give us heartburn, or Gastroesophageal reflux disease, G.R.D."
Health,"So that's why we have heartburn but rodents or horses don't. Rodents and horses actually have their own true sphincter that sit here. So instead they have an actual, dedicated ring of muscle, rather than a sheet. Now the other thing about the esophagus, which is pretty interesting, is that it works as a passageway for food, it doesn't do much. The only process that it can kind of claim to have any stake in, is what's referred to as peristalsis."
Health,"Peristalsis, and this is going to be an important term for the discussion of the rest of the GI tract. Peristalsis is just the wave-like propulsion of food. Wave-like propulsion. I'll just write that for now. Because, you'll have the contraction of the esophagus at on point up here, like so. And by doing that, it relaxes down here. It relaxes here."
Health,"And so when it relaxes here and contracts up here, that means that if you have a bolus of food, like a little circle that's right there, it's more inclined to move this way, directly ahead. And that's peristalsis. And the way we control that is kind of in three parts along the esophagus. Because the esophagus is not just skeletal muscle all the way or not even just smooth muscle. It's split up into thirds. So I'll draw three parts of the esophagus here."
Health,"So the first part that we have is actually just skeletal muscle. So it's under our voluntary control. Skeletal muscle. And so that's 1/3, I'll say the top 1/3 of the esophagus. In the middle right here, we actually have a mix. We have skeletal under our control, plus smooth muscle. And they kind of work together. So it's sort of in our control, but also not really. So that's going to be the middle 1/3 of the esophagus. The middle 1/3."
Health,"And kind of, as the progression goes, finally when we get to the end right here, this last 1/3 of the esophagus is going to be smooth muscle. So that's our last 1/3. And so that's how the esophagus is split up into three parts. Skeletal at the top 1/3. Skeletal and smooth for the middle 1/3. and then smooth entirely for the last 1/3. And that's how our esophagus works, as well.."
Health,"First of all, it is going to receive a bolus of food from the esophagus above. This bolus is just food that has been turned into a sphere, that can now be processed. Then the stomach can do two things here to help process the food even more. The first thing the stomach does, is that it churns this bolus or it churns the food. The muscular walls of the stomach here allow it to compress down and break up this food even more. In addition, there's also a certain degree of hydrolysis."
Health,"Hydrolysis, or enzyme assisted degradation, or breakdown of this bolus and we will talk about the enzyme that's responsible for this process in a moment. And then finally after we do all these things, we receive a product that is called chyme. Chyme is just a mixture of whatever the bolus has been broken up to, including the gastric enzymes and juices that we've used. And then, the food is going to actually just stay here for a little bit, because the stomach also stores food."
Health,"It will store the food, until it's an appropriate time for the chyme to be squirted into the duodenum, or the first part of the small intestine to be processed. And that's why we can store up to two to four liters of food, at any given time. Now, what about the anatomy of the stomach here? How do we release these enzymes and breakdown this bolus? Let's take a look at a little bit of gastric anatomy right about there, and see how it's responsible for the breakdown of food here."
Health,"We can imagine that the stomach is lined with all these infoldings. These infoldings of the gastric wall, that help to increase the surface area and in doing so there's actually a layer of cells that sit around here. This layer of cells actually secretes a lot of the components of the gastric juice we're going to see, and it is nicely ripe with a ton important components. And the main thing to remember in the stomach is that there are three types of cells that are involved here."
Health,"The first type I am going to talk about are called parietal cells, parietal cells. And the main thing that is released from parietal cells is hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid, it is a very acidic or very corrosive acid that's actually more acidic than battery acid. In addition to parietal cells we also have chief cells, chief cells. These guys secrete an enzyme called pepsinogen, pepsinogen. And this is the inactive form of the enzyme."
Health,"Pepsinogen is not active, in fact, in order for hydrolysis to occur we need an enzyme that's call pepsin. How is pepsin made? Well, we're going to need pepsinogen to make it, but the pepsinogen and whenever you see ""gen"", at the end of the name, that means that it is almost there. It just needs to be processed. In order to turn pepsinogen in to pepsin, we need hydrochloric acid which will break down this protein to turn it in to this active form, that can then be used for hydrolysis."
Health,"Now, what would happen if we just had a bunch of pepsin, or a bunch of hydrochloric acid present in the stomach all the time? What do you think would happen to the stomach? It would probably eat itself alive, isn't that right? I mean you've got your cell membrane that definitely has a considerable amount of protein that should be present there. And in addition you've got this really corrosive acidic substance, that can eat through your stomach."
Health,"And that's actually how you have gastric ulcers, but not all of us have gastric ulcers. What do we also have in our gastric pits right here, that help us prevent gastric ulcers from occurring in the first place? Well, the third type of cell we have sitting in here are actually called mucus cells, mucus cells."
Health,"And just like the name suggest, mucus cells release what's called mucin and this is a coating that will sit around the stomach to make sure that things like pepsin, or hydrochloric acid don't degrade the stomach. Without mucus cells we would eat ourselves alive. So, as a review, the three things a stomach will do for us is that it will churn with its very muscular walls to help break down the bolus, in a very physical activity."
Health,"Also, there's an enzymatic or chemical process that occurs here, where we used pepsin to degrade food. Now, pepsin itself only degrades one type of nutrient and that's it protein. This will break peptide bonds or the bond that connects amino acids to one another, to degrade your protein macromolecules. So, that's the only type of nutrient that's broken down in your stomach."
Health,"Once we hydrolyze a significant amount of the protein we're going to produce chyme, that is stored in the stomach until it's the right time for it to be released into the next part of your GI tract called the duodenum. The first part of the small intestine, and that's how your stomach works.."
Health,"So, as a review, once you put food into your oral cavity or your mouth, it's chewed up and then sent down the esophagus where it ends up in the stomach where it's churned and then introduced to acid where it gets broken down into chyme and then delivered into the first part of your small intestine. Now, the small intestine has three different parts to it. So, let's take a better look. So, the first part of the small intestine is called the duodenum, the duo-denum."
Health,"This receives the chyme that just got processed in the stomach and it's the part of the entire GI tract where the most digestion occurs. The most breakdown of food products will happen in the duodenum. All right, so the next part of the small intestine is called the jejunum. I'll just write that right here, the jejunum. And this is the part of the entire GI tract where the most absorption occurs, anywhere. So, the most absorption of nutrients is going to happen in your jejunum, the jejunum."
Health,"Then, finally after your food passes to the jejunum, it gets to the last part of the small intestine and that's called the ileum, the ileum (I-L-E-U-M). And the ileum, now this doesn't have a superlative like the most digestion or the most absorption, but there are some pretty important things that are absorbed here. Things like vitamin B12, vitamin A, D, E, K. So, there are some important things that are absorbed here. So, I'm just going to write important absorption."
Health,"There are some important things that are absorbed in your ileum. Now, the busiest part of your small intestine is the duodenum, because there are a bunch of things that are involved in this digestion process. So, there are four key things to keep in mind. First of all, your stomach is going to be delivering a bunch of chyme or processed food into the duodenum. So, you're going to be working with all this chyme here. In addition, you're going to have some stomach acid that process food into chyme."
Health,"That's going to be present in the duodenum. In addition to the stomach, the liver and the gallbladder are also going to be important to deliver bile to your duodenum. So, they give bile. And as I'll talk about in a subsequent video, bile is composed of two different things. Bile salts and bile pigments. And beyond the liver and the gallbladder, the pancreas also delivers a couple of very important enzymes for digestion here. So, I'm just going to write enzymes for now."
Health,"And in a minute, I'm going to go through and talk about which enzymes are delivered by the pancreas. And then finally the duodenum itself has what are called brush border enzymes, brush border enzymes. That are very important for activation of certain enzymes and also for digestion of several nutrients that we're going to discuss. So, let's talk a little more about this brush border. Now, if I would have make a little drawing of the duodenum right here. Remember that first part of our small intestine."
Health,"I would draw just a little tube, connected right there. And then blow up the wall if I want to take a better look at what's going on right there. We would find then that there is a whole bunch of things than just meets the eye. First of all, the wall isn't just a straight line. There is actually a bunch of infoldings that are present on the wall to help increase surface area. Think about it."
Health,"If we're trying to digest as much as we can here, we need to make sure that there are a lot of projections or a lot of space where we can make contact with the food that's passing by. So, if this is the inside of our duodenum, and this is the outside, just like how we drew up here. That's in and that's out. You can notice that this wall here has a whole bunch of projections on it. These projections are called villi (V-I-L-L-I), villi. And a single one of them is just called a villus, just a single villus."
Health,"And these are just a couple of folds or these outpouchings that help increase the surface area of our duodenum. Now, that's not where the story ends. If we take a closer look at one of these villi, then we'd find that there are even more projections sitting on that, even smaller microscopic projections. So, for this single villus that had a horizontal line right here for its shape. Fair to draw it out here."
Health,"You'd notice that it's not a straight line, but instead these also have a bunch of projections that are present on them. And if you were to guess why all these projections are in there? I'm sure you'd say to further increase our surface area. That's sort of the name of the game when we're in the small intestine. To increase our surface area. And so these little guys cutely enough are called microvilli, microvilli. And a single one is just called a microvillus."
Health,"So, we've got these villi right here or the single villus that you can see if you just blow up the wall of the duodenum. And then if you blow up a single villus, you'll find that they have a whole bunch of microvilli that are found on them too, to increase our surface area because that allows for better digestion. And when we say brush border enzymes, these are a whole bunch of enzymes that are present on this brush border. You guys think about it."
Health,"These villi and these microvilli, they're no different from bristles on a comb. They act to increase surface area or places where you're going to have interaction with food that you want to digest. And so there are enzymes that are present on this brush border. So, just to make the point, all of these microvilli and villi together, that's what makes up the brush border of our duodenum."
Health,"The brush border, which is the increased surface area of the wall helps to digest food with our brush border enzymes that are present. And as we'll see later, in the jejunum, it helps for absorption. So, now let's talk about the digestion process in detail.."
Health,"And they're connected by something called a peptide bond. After proteins we also have things that are called carbohydrates. Carbohydrates or carbs and these are just repeating units of simple sugars attached to each other. Can you name one simple sugar? Yeah, I think you said glucose. Something like glucose attached to say galactose would be a disaccharide. This particular disaccharide would be called lactose."
Health,"So a single sugar would be considered a monosaccharide, two of them a disaccharide, and then a whole bunch would be a polysaccharide. In addition to our carbs, we also have nucleotides. And these guys make up our nucleic acid, our DNA, and they're composed of three major parts. There's a phosphate group that sits on a ribose sugar, that I'm drawing here, this little pentagon, and then right here you're going to have the base that's present."
Health,"This base is the coating part of your DNA, like adenine or guanine if you've heard those names before. And then finally, we also have fat. Fat has two parts to it, it's got this triglycerol head that has these three oxygen groups on it and then each of these oxygens has a fatty acid tail. So there's one, there's two, there's three. So three fatty acid tails that are found here."
Health,"So now that we know what the main macro molecules are we can talk about what are the main processes that are involved in breaking these guys up so they can be absorbed into our blood stream. Starting with our proteins, there's going to be brush border enzymes that are present to help break our peptide bonds or the amino acid bond that's present."
Health,"So I'll just write peptidases here, because as you might recall, whenever you name an enzyme that ends in 'ase', that mean whatever comes before it is what's broken. So, a peptide bond is broken by a peptidase. In addition the pancreas brings along a couple of important enzymes that will help break up our proteins. First of all it's got trypsinogen that's present as well as some chymotrypsinogen."
Health,"But whenever you see 'gen' at the end of an enzymes name, that means it's not ready to work yet, that means it still needs one more cut. or cleavage before it can start being completely functional. Well this is where our brush border comes in handy again, because there's an enzyme present on the brush border that's called enteropeptidase. That is specifically present to break down trypsinogen into it's active form called trypsin. And the same thing with chymotrypsinogen into chymotrypsin."
Health,"These guys are going to be able to break down your peptide bond as well. Just like peptidases are able to do, but need a little kick or a little cut in order to start working. And once we gobble up our proteins we'll have our single amino acid sub-units then and be absorbed."
Health,"When we get to carbs we notice that the pancreas is also pretty helpful here as well, because the pancreas releases an enzyme that's called amylase that can help break up the sugar bond or this glycosidic bond is another name for this link right here in certain carbohydrates. The brush border is also helpful here because they have a whole bunch of very specific enzymes that break the glycosidic bond between very specific simple sugars."
Health,"For instance, the brush border enzyme know as lactase can only be used to break apart lactose, like I've drawn here. Now the interesting thing about lactose that I should mention is that when you get the stomach flu, you've got a bug that's just sitting in your tummy, it actually can start inflaming the duodenum wall and by doing so it can knock off some of the lactase brush border enzymes. And so you won't have lactase. You won't be able to break down lactose."
Health,"You won't be able to separate our glucose from our galactose. And so temporarily, you're going to be lactose intolerant. Most people gain this ability back, but you can understand now how precious these brush border enzymes are to us. They'll help break up certain disaccharides, the pancreas will do it's job as well, and eventually you'll just have your simple sugars that are going to be left over here. And remember the name for each single unit is called a monosaccharide."
Health,"When it comes the nucleotides the brush border helps this as well. The specific enzyme set that we have on our brush border that helps break apart nucleotides are called nucleo-, wait for it, -sidases, nucleosidases. And the reason why we have nucleosidases and not nucleotidases, is because it breaks this bond right there, resulting in this phosphate group sticking on the ribose sugar. But now we've got our base as a completely separate unit from the nucleoside."
Health,"Finally, when it comes to fat we're going to get some help from bile, as I mentioned earlier. And bile, if you recall, comes from our liver and our gall bladder. So these guys are going to release some bile into our duodenum. They're going to help emulsify or organize our fat. So I'll write right here in parenthesis organize, because they're not really involved in breaking them down, they're there to help organize our fats. One of the main things that help us actually break it down is from the pancreas."
Health,"The pancreas releases something that's called lipase. The lipase comes in and cleaves right about there. That way each of these single fatty acid chains break off and so you'll have these three fatty acid chains that are hanging out right here, including your triglyceride head that's going to be a separate unit all together. Now you've got these four things that came off this one fat molecule.."
Health,"So, now we're so close. We've got all of our monomers, but we need to figure out how the heck are we going to get them inside our blood stream. Well, starting with our amino acids here. These guys are going to be shuttled into cells using what's called primary active transport, primary active transport. Now, if I say primary here, what does that specifically indicate as used? Now, you might recall when we use active transport, that means we need a little bit of energy to get something to happen."
Health,"And the form of energy that we use in primary active transport comes from ATP, the energy, the unit of life, adenosine tri as an three, phosphate. And so if we look at a single enterocyte or an intestinal cell, there would be a protein that's here on the cell membrane. This protein would break apart our ATP, cleaving off one of the phosphate groups to release adenosine diphosphate, so that's two, diphosphate. And in doing so, would allow our amino acid to enter into our enterocyte or our intestinal cell."
Health,"From there, the amino acid could undergo a couple of different steps, but eventually will leave the enterocyte and go to a blood capillary, where it enters the blood stream and then can be shuttled anywhere else in the body for use. Monosaccharides are sugars, sort of have a similar thing going on, but instead of primary active transport, we have what's called secondary active transport going on."
Health,"So, if we use the ATP for primary active transport, what do we use for secondary? Well, the fact that we're saying this is still active transport means that there was some energy that was used at some point, and the energy actually was invested in sending up an ion gradient. And so the ion gradient then could be used by allowing something like sodium to flow down its gradient, to go from the place of high concentration to low concentration where it can relax."
Health,"And by allowing that to occur, energy is then harnessed allowing a monosaccharide or a sugar to enter into our enterocyte. And just to make sure we're complete, I'm going to draw the protein transporter we have here as well as one on the other side, and show that there is a sodium ion that's flowing into our enterocyte down its concentration gradient to end up in the enterocyte with the sugar. And sort of the same thing happens on the other side, except as the sugar leaves, sodium on this side is entering."
Health,"So, the sodium is still flowing down its concentration gradient, but it ends up inside the enterocyte while the sugar leaves and goes to the blood capillary. So this also ends up in our blood stream and can go anywhere in the body to be used. The nucleoside in the base sort of use the same mechanism that amino acids do. So, I'm just going to write primary active transport right here. And you can take a look above to see how that happens. And by doing that, you can imagine where they are going to end up."
Health,"That's right, the blood capillary as well. And that takes us to our last macro molecule, fat. Now, the thing about fat that's rather redonkulous is that because it's got this really nonpolar tail. If it ever shows up next to an enterocyte like this guy, all it has to do is just diffuse across the membrane, and then it ends up on the inside. In the enterocyte, all of our fatty acids are going to be reorganized into what are called chylomicrons, chylomicrons."
Health,"And like the name, chylomicrons themselves are too big to fit directly into a blood capillary. I couldn't even fit it here in this enterocyte. So, it doesn't actually directly go into the blood capillary. It is too big to do that. Too big to go to the blood capillary. Instead, chylomicrons will be absorbed into what are called lymphatic, lymphatic capillary, also known as a lacteal, a lymphatic capillary. And these are big enough to accommodate our chylomicrons."
Health,"Here, they're going to be further digested and broken down into smaller bits, and by the time that happens, they will end up in veins. That will send the digested fat through the heart and eventually to arteries. That can then distribute them wherever they need to go in the body. And so you can appreciate a lot it's going on here. We've talked about how all four of our major macromolecules are digested in the duodenum, the place where the most digestion occurs in the GI tract."
Health,"And now, we just talked about how they are absorbed, most likely in the jejunum, right. Because the jejunum is where the most absorption occurs anywhere in the GI tract. And that's how our small intestine works.."
Health,"It's the only one that you can take a piece of, this small chunk right here, and transplant into a recipient that has cirrhosis or liver failure, and it can grow to become a much larger organ that can sustain the patient. How wild is that? And so to better understand the liver, we'll start by discussing the main functions it's responsible for."
Health,"The first thing we need to think about is that it's responsible for metabolism, metabolism, and that involves the breakdown of nutrients or catabolism, and I'll just write cat right here, catabolism, as well as the buildup of larger macromolecules, and that's through anabolism. So, catabolism and anabolism are achieved in the liver. The other function the liver is responsible for is storage of these nutrients."
Health,"\When we're not breaking them down or building them up, we need to have a place for them to hang out, and so, they're responsible for the storage of our carbohydrates, so I'll just write carbs right here, and also mainly our fats, so these two guys, and they're stored in three different ways. First, carbs or fats can be stored as glycogen. Glycogen is just a polysaccharide, so a linkage of a whole bunch of monosaccharides or simple sugars."
Health,"The other thing that we can store our carbs or our fats as are lipoproteins, lipo meaning fatty and proteins meaning, well, protein, and then lastly, we can also store these guys as triglycerides, triglycerides, which is one of the forms of fat that we ingest in our food. Now, these are two of the major macromolecules we use for energy. The other major macromolecule class that the liver sees are proteins, but these aren't really stored in the liver."
Health,"Instead, they're processed into molecules like albumin and then cast off into the bloodstream, where they'll float around and carry out other functions, until they need to be retrieved by the liver to be broken down or used for other molecules. The other major process the liver is responsible for is called detoxification, detoxification, and this is one of those awesome scientific terms where the function is in the name. This is where we take toxins and modify them so they can't harm our body."
Health,"This is achieved mainly by cytochrome P450 enzymes, cytochrome P450, and these are kind of funky enzymes, because unlike the other ones you've probably heard about before, these don't bind a specific single substrate or molecule. If you remember an enzyme like phenylalanine hydroxylase, that's something that will add a hydroxyl group to phenylalanine and only phenylalanine, but cytochrome P450's will take a whole bunch of different substrates and react with them."
Health,"That's something that's pretty unique to this class of enzymes. Now, because of these cytochrome P450 enzymes, we have a problem when we take medications."
Health,"In fact, we have a decrease in drug efficacy because of this detoxification process, and what we mean by drug efficacy is the amount of an effect a drug is able to have, and so, if the liver or these enzymes perceive medications that we ingest to be foreign or like toxins, they're going to try and break them down so they don't cause an effect to our body."
Health,"So, doctors knows this, and because of that, a specific dose must be given to account for the amount of a drug that's going to be detoxified by the liver. And finally, as we'll talk about in a separate video in better detail, the last thing that the liver is responsible for is bile production, bile production, and as you might recall from our discussion on small bowel, bile is needed for the absorption of fats from our food."
Health,"Okay, so now that we understand what are the main functions of the liver, how does it get all the nutrients that we ingest and absorb from our intestinal tract to be metabolized or stored or detoxified in the liver? Well, let's take a look at the blood supply to the liver. So, one of the things that makes the liver so unique is that it has two separate blood supplies. The first, that comes in from the intestinal tract, is from the portal vein."
Health,"The portal venous system is another term for it, and the portal vein supplies the liver with nutrient-rich blood, nutrient-rich."
Health,"So, where do these nutrients come from? Well, food that's absorbed in the intestinal tract will then go through the circulation and end up in the portal vein, to be delivered to the liver for metabolism, and so we consider this blood to be nutrient-rich, but where does the liver get its oxygen from? Well, that's a separate blood source, and that's actually through what's called the proper hepatic artery, the proper hepatic artery, and as the name suggests, this is arterial blood that will be supplying oxygen-rich red blood cells."
Health,"So great, these are the two different sources of blood that go to the liver. Well, what about blood that leaves the liver? There's one main vessel that carries blood out of the liver, and that's called the hepatic vein. The hepatic vein is the exact opposite as the two other types of vessels we just talked about. It's nutrient- and oxygen-poor."
Health,"Blood that leaves through the hepatic vein from the liver will circulate back to the heart to receive oxygen, flow past the intestines to receive nutrients, and then return to the liver, either through the portal vein or through the proper hepatic artery."
Health,"The other output of the liver, that I guess I should mention right now, we'll talk about in more detail in a separate video, is bile, and bile mainly leaves the liver through what's called the common hepatic duct, the common hepatic duct, common hepatic duct that will take bile.."
Health,"This is our pancreas, which I believe you may have heard about before. The pancreas sits below and behind the stomach, and it kind of hugs the first part of our small intestine here, which I think you may now recognize as called the duodenum. In fact, it wraps around a little more than what I've drawn right here. But just know that it sits back, way back over here."
Health,"In fact, some say that the pancreas sits in a completely separate compartment from our stomach, our small intestine, our large intestine, even our liver. It sits not in the peritoneum. The peritoneum is where the rest of our gut sit. The peritoneum is just a fancy word for the abdomen. So, our stomach sits in our peritoneum, our liver sits in our peritoneum, the small intestine, the large intestine, all these guys sit in our peritoneum. But our pancreas is different because it sits in the retroperitoneum."
Health,"And when we say retroperitoneum, that means it sits in the back of the abdomen. Now, it's not they're alone. A lot of our big vessels that run through the abdomen are also there. The abdominal aorta, the inferior vena cava, these things you may have heard of elsewhere. But it sits in this very different compartment. And in fact, medical professionals, the pancreas is actually a force to be reckoned with, for a couple of reasons. First of all, it releases a bunch of powerful enzymes."
Health,"Powerful enzymes that we're going to talk about in a minute. And these powerful enzymes can digest a whole bunch of our macromolecules. Things that we eat, but also the things that line our cell membranes or make up other parts of our body. Not just in the retroperitoneum but in the peritoneum, the thorax, everywhere else in our body. So, it releases powerful enzymes. And two, the pancreas is little strange in that it's unencapsulated, unencapsulated, which is different from other organs like the liver."
Health,"The liver has got the liver capsule. The kidney is covered by its own capsule, but the pancreas is essentially just a slurry of cells that's hanging somehow in the retroperitoneum. And that makes it a little difficult, especially for surgeons that have to operate nearby. You don't want to mess with the pancreas because it's got all these powerful enzymes that could cause a lot of damage around it if they were released. No wonder then, the pancreas has sort of earned itself a special nick name."
Health,"Many physicians consider the pancreas to be the lion of the abdomen because of how important it is, and additionally, how powerful the enzymes are that come from it. So just like the lion in the jungle, you don't want to mess with the pancreas. So let's take a few minutes then and talk about what makes the pancreas so special. Physiologically, the pancreas releases two types of things or has two main components to it. One, there is the exocrine pancreas."
Health,"And the idea behind the exocrine pancreas is that it takes salts, and I'll write it down here, enzymes. So, these powerful enzymes I talked about earlier. It takes these salts and enzymes and releases them in the duodenum or the duo-denum. And I think you remember where that is. That's the first part of the small intestine right after the stomach. And so our exocrine pancreas has four main roles that it accomplishes. So, firstly as you may recall."
Health,"Because the pancreas releases its contents into the duodenum, think about what the duodenum is receiving right beforehand. As we talked about in the video on the stomach, we're getting a whole bunch of chyme that's been digested by gastric acid or hydrochloric acid. And so we'll need something to neutralize all that acid. And so the exocrine pancreas release bicarbonate. The bicarbonate here will serve to neutralize our gastric acid."
Health,"So, we will neutralize the pH or the very low pH that we're receiving from the stomach in the form of gastric acid. And remember again, the gastric acid is hydrochloric acid. Next, as we move on, we will talk about some of those powerful enzymes that we discussed earlier. One of them that we briefly mentioned when we were talking about the mouth, is amylase. And if you recall, amylase is responsible for the breakdown of the starch."
Health,"And if you remember, starch is just a whole bunch of carbohydrates stacked upon one another. And we break down starch into our smaller carbohydrates. So, I'll just write smaller carbs for right now. And so that will include things like those glucose monomers or even disaccharides. And then another enzyme that we also release from the exocrine pancreas into the duodenum is something called lipase. And lipase should be another throwback to the mouth because its name suggest that it breaks down lipids."
Health,"So, specifically it will take triglycerides, which I can draw here. So, here is a triglyceride, right there. And you've got these fatty acid chains that are coming off the glycerol head. It will take triglycerides and it will break them down into free fatty acids. And so those will look like this. So that's the acid part and here's the fatty acid part, as well as things like monoglycerides. And monoglycerides look like this. And we're calling them mono because they've only got one fatty acid chain on them."
Health,"We could also have diglycerides, which I think you might be able to guess what these guys look like. If I draw them out like here. Diglycerides are going to have two fatty acid chains on them. There you go. And then it also will release glycerol, glycerol. And glycerol is what happens when you get rid of all your fatty acid chains. And so you'll have some of these guys and they're all ... OH is right here."
Health,"So that's what your lipase will do, and it's similar to the lingual lipase that you had in your mouth. But in the mouth, it was mainly for taste when you digested your triglyceride. In the duodenum, this enzyme works to break down triglycerides in a greater manner. And then finally, the last function of the exocrine pancreas involves its proteolytic enzymes. I'll just write proteolytic right here. And I'll expand. There are two types of proteolytic enzymes."
Health,"There is trypsinogen that it releases, trypsinogen. There is trypsinogen and there is also chymo. This is a longer word, chymotrypsinogen. Trypsinogen. And I think there is a couple of light bulbs that should be coming on right now because whenever you see the suffix ""ogen"" as we see down here. That refers to something that's called a zymogen. A zymogen, which means an enzyme that is inactive right now because it has an extra bond."
Health,"Usually, a peptide bond that needs to be broken in order for it to start doing its thing. So, trypsinogen is the inactive form of trypsin. Just like how chymotrypsinogen is the inactive form of chymotrypsin. And these guys need to be activated. And the way that's done is in the duodenum. There is an enzyme that sits there called enteropeptidase. There is a whole bunch of enteropeptidases that line the duodenum. Your enteropeptidase will break down trypsinogen to form trypsin."
Health,"Trypsin is the active form that's then going to be able to break down proteins. And what we're doing here is actually causing a chain reaction. Because once trypsin is formed, the next step in activating chymotrypsinogen is accomplished by trypsin. Trypsin will cleave your chymotrypsinogen to form, and this is a very long word, chymotrypsin, chymotrypsin. And these guys will go wreak havoc and break down proteins in the duodenum."
Health,"Now, my question to you is these are enzymes and they're inactive because of usually a single bond. But what happens when that bond that makes them inactive breaks? Say, if you're in a car accident and you get hit in the stomach and there was enough force there that can provide activation energy to break a bond and turn trypsinogen into trypsin."
Health,"What would happen? Well, as we mentioned earlier, because the pancreas is unencapsulated, activated trypsin will go on to activate chymotrypsinogen into the chymotrypsin and then will break down proteins wherever they see them. And that can be membrane proteins. They could be proteins that are in the surface of the duodenum. They could be proteins that we digested in our food or they could be proteins that are present in the pancreas. So you can see why the pancreas is so feared."
Health,And that's why the pancreas is something you don't want to have damaged. Because we can activate these deadly enzymes that should be working in the duodenum..
Health,"The endocrine pancreas will release hormones rather than the salts or enzymes we saw above, ""will release hormones"" that go into the blood stream. And they will move on elsewhere throughout the body, to the liver perhaps the intestine, or even as far as muscles to cause things to happen. And the way the endocrine pancreas is organized is that there are many ""eyes lit"" cells, it's actually pronounced ""eye-lets"" but I'm mispronouncing it just to let you know how it's spelled."
Health,"Islet cells that exist and sit in islands, ""Sit in islands."" So, there are three types, or three main types of islet cells that we're going to talk about and they're all present to some extent in each island, or group of cells in the pancreas. Let's go through them one by one. So, first of all, we've got what are called alpha islet cells, ""alpha islet cells."" And these guys release a hormone that's called glucagon, ""glucagon""."
Health,"And the main function of glucagon is to take things like glycogen, which is a whole bunch of glucose molecules that are stacked up on top of each other, and then break them down into smaller glucose monomers or molecules. So, we're making glucose from glycogen whenever we release our glucagon. I'll write ""glucagon"" up here. And it's not just carbohydrates. But glucagon is responsible for the breakdown of a whole bunch of macromolecules."
Health,"So, I'll just drive it home by writing, ""glucagon causes break down"" over here. The next type of islet cell that we have and perhaps the most famous of them all are our beta islet cells. So, our beta islet cells house and release insulin. Now when you hear ""insulin"", there should be a lot of lightbulbs coming up because insulin is responsible for a whole bunch of things."
Health,"For one, when we look over here, insulin is what causes the opposite of this reaction, where instead of breaking down glucagen into glucose, insulin causes glucose to be stored or built up into glycogen. So insulin does the exact opposite. And again to drive that home. It's not just for carbohydrates, but its for a whole bunch of things that get built up. So I'll write ""insulin is responsible for the build up or storage of our macromolecules""."
Health,"But what might be the most important thing to mention about insulin, is that it is the hormone that is related to or responsible for the disease known as diabetes. Gosh, we could have entire tutorials on diabetes and what it does and what it means."
Health,"But for right now, just know that at it's bare basics, diabetes occurs or causes damage to our bodies because we have too much glucose, ""too much glucose"", floating around in our body, too much sugar, alright? And that happens because insulin is not working properly. We're not building up and storing glucose and glycogen like were supposed to be doing. Instead it's running all over the body."
Health,"And because of that, we have what's called ""eye, nerve and kidney disease"", that's sort of the catch phrase we use in medicine to describe diabetes. It's eye nerve and kidney disease because with too much glucose over time we're unable to see. The nerves most commonly in our feet are not able to sense pricks or stings or damage that occurs there and eventually can cause amputation. And our kidneys stop working over time, which can lead to dialysis and that causes early death."
Health,"And in addition to these three, glucose goes all over the body and causes a whole bunch of other things like earlier onset of heartattack and other types of complications. The other thing I should mention about diabetes is that there are two types of diabetes, ""there are two types"". There is type one diabetes and there is type two. And the way you differentiate type one versus Type two diabetes is based on how it's caused. And this all points back to insulin. In type one diabetes, we have no insulin."
Health,"So, the person who has type one diabetes has no insulin production. And because of that we're not able to store our sugar and glycogen, we're not able to put it away. And so we have it all over the place. That causes eye nerve and kidney disease among other complications. In type two diabetes, your insulin receptors. So, you have insulin that's being produced, but your insulin receptors are broken, ""your insulin receptors are broken""."
Health,"So, even if we do produce insulin and it goes where it's supposed to go in our body, these receptors will not respond. And so it's as if we don't have insulin in our body at all. And there's so much more that we can say here, but we'll close our conversation on diabetes for now and we'll revisit this later. Let's move on to the third type of islet cell we've got in the pancreas and those are delta islet cells, ""delta islet cells""."
Health,"And these are the guys that release a hormone called ""somatostatin"" which is the major party pooping hormone released from the pancreas because its main job is to stop the jobs of all the other hormones that are active. And these hormones can include things like we've talked about here, glucagon, insulin. There are other hormones that are also contained in the GI tract that include things like cholecystokinin that we talked about elsewhere."
Health,"And symatostatin will go in and cause the effects of those hormones to stop and that's sort of its main role there. So, that's our endocrine pancreas and we talked about earlier our exocrine pancreas. So, the pancreas is responsible for a lot. No wonder surgeons have the phrase, ""Eat when you can, sleep when you can, and don't mess with the pancreas.""."
Health,"Let's zoom in and focus on what happens after we absorb our food in the small intestine. It looks like our food passes into the large intestine, as you can see here. Keep in mind, when we call it the large intestine, that does not mean it's the long intestine. In fact, it's shorter than the small intestine we just passed through. It starts right here and continues on to about this point. The end of the small intestine is the ileo… the ileocecal valve."
Health,"The ileocecal valve, and that's the point where our large intestine begins, and this makes sense because, remember, the last part of the small intestine is called the ileum. The first part of our large intestine is called the cecum. The cecum. You can notice this little tail-like guy hanging out right here. This doesn't look like it does much, right? It looks like some functionless structure and, in fact, this is one of the most common causes of surgery in the GI tract. This guy is your appendix."
Health,"That's the appendix right here. This is the part where our large intestine begins. Just to finish up our road map, this part of the large intestine as it ascends upwards, called the right colon but, most specifically, we call it the ascending colon. This is the ascending colon, and it does exactly what its name suggests, it ascends upwards. It goes from the inferior point of your abdomen to a more superior point, or above, and then we go this way."
Health,"We run transversely, right? The part of the large intestine that continues on after the ascending colon is called the transverse colon, another great name that describes how it runs. The transverse colon, because it runs transversely. Next, we'll get into this part here. If we saw this part ascending, then I guess we could call this part the descending colon. The descending colon. Great names here. Great names in the large intestine or the colon. This is the descending colon."
Health,"The descending colon does what it says. It descends. The last part of our large intestine, where we're not really descending anymore, but we're, kind of, flipping around like this, we're going upwards, you see, sort of, an S shape sometimes. There's an S shape that occurs, and so this last part is called the sigmoid colon. Sigmoid, because it's got an S shape to it. That's your sigmoid colon. What are the things the large intestine is most responsible for absorbing? Let's make this list right here."
Health,"What does it absorb most importantly, and what's the impact of that? The first thing you've got to think about is water. Water is the main thing your large intestine is going to be absorbing, and it's very important for regulating, sort of, the output that we're eventually going to get from down here at the anus. Now, what would happen if we absorbed too little water? Too little water. That would mean that our output would tend to be more watery, right, because we didn't absorb that into our body."
Health,"Now, that is what would cause diarrhea. Diarrhea, because you're going to have too much water left over in your stool. Now, let's think about the opposite case. What if we absorb too much water, right? There's too much water that's taken, so your stool is not as soft anymore."
Health,"Water, as we can think about, is, sort of, the component of your stool that makes it relatively softer, so if we have too much water absorbed in our large intestine or in our colon, we'll get the opposite of diarrhea, right? We're going to get constipated. Constipated. Constipation, which is not good either. The large intestine is very important for regulating exactly how much water needs to be removed. One of the other things that we can mention at this point also is the disease known as cholera."
Health,"I'm sure you've heard of this before. It's this terrible disease, where you have a bacteria attack certain receptors or certain proteins that are on your intestinal lining, specifically in your large intestine, and what that means is you're going to start losing a tremendous amount of fluid, eventually leading to death by dehydration. The interesting thing here is that if you can keep a person hydrated for long enough, your GI will actually pass the bacterium out."
Health,"If you can keep a person hydrated while they have cholera, you can get them past the disease to be able to survive. The next important thing we should talk about that gets absorbed in the large intestine are inorganic ions. Inorganic ions, we talked about earlier, when we discussed the small intestine."
Health,"These include things like sodium or potassium and, remember, back then, sodium was absorbed as a co-transport mechanism with things like amino-acids to help in their absorption, and that occurs, to a smaller extent, here in the large intestine. Now, one of the interesting things that come up because of this, if you notice water and inorganic ions, things like sodium, potassium chloride, the large intestine is not the only place that it does that. Neither is the small intestine."
Health,"In fact, the organ that's most responsible for the absorption of your water and your inorganic ions is the kidney. Because of that, if we lost the large intestine entirely, if you had some sort of accident, or if you had a disease like Crohn's Disease, or ulcerative colitis, one of the treatments for ulcerative colitis is a total colectomy, so you remove the entire colon so you don't have that inflammatory process."
Health,"You won't be able to absorb water or inorganic ions in your large intestine, but what that means is you still have the kidney. The kidney can still fulfil this function. Now, another interesting thing that I'm going to mention about the large intestine is that it's a rich source of microorganisms, microorganisms like bacteria."
Health,"This gets a little weird because the question might be why do we have bacteria hanging out in our colon? What's the purpose of that? Bacteria in our colon actually assist in the digestion of nutrients that we're not able to do because we lack those enzymes. They assist in digestion mostly of carbohydrates, and this is, kind of, a significant process."
Health,"You know, I read somewhere that about five percent of your output, your stool at the end, is composed of microorganisms like bacteria, and these are very important for digesting things like carbs. I'll put carbs here in parentheses, and, oftentimes, the by-products you'll get of that are things like methane, CH4, and then the other thing is hydrogen sulfide, which you may not have thought of this way but, actually, sort of, explains a lot."
Health,"Methane is something that causes a lot of flatulence, and then hydrogen sulfide is something that smells terrible, and one food that we often eat that gets a bad rep are beans that are pretty rich in carbohydrates that we're not able to absorb because we lack the enzymes. The microorganisms in our large intestine actually do most of the digestion of the carbohydrates that we have in our beans."
Health,"You've probably heard that rhyme before, ""Beans, beans good for the heart, ""the more you eat, the more you produce ""methane and hydrogen sulfide."" All right, enough farting around. Let's talk about the last part of our GI tract finally. Now that we've passed through the large intestine, the next place we're going to go is the rectum. Now, the rectum isn't responsible for any absorption or any breakdown. The main thing that the rectum accomplishes for us is storage."
Health,"Now, we don't really think about it, but this is actually a very important part of our GI tract because, once we've processed food, and we've taken out all the water, and now we've finally produced the waste product that we're going to take to the bathroom, we don't want it to come out right away, right? You want to hold on to it until it's a more appropriate time to expel that, and the rectum is key for this, because it's going to hold onto stool until it's an appropriate time to get to the bathroom."
Health,"What about the last part of our GI tract? The anus. Now, the anus itself is composed of two sphincters. As you might recall from our discussion on the esophagus, sphincters are just muscles that close off a hole. There are two sphincters that are responsible for the anus. There's going to be the internal anal sphincter, and there's going to be the external anal sphincter. The internal anal sphincter is composed of smooth muscle."
Health,"The external anal sphincter, the one that's, sort of, wrapping around the internal anal sphincter, is composed of skeletal muscle, skeletal muscle that we control. Smooth muscle is under involuntary control. We have stool present in our rectum, it pushes on the internal anal sphincter, the internal anal sphincter will relax and open and allow the stool to move forward. Now, that doesn't mean that everything comes out right away, because we have an external anal sphincter."
Health,"This is something that's under our control, but then we finally get to the toilet, and it's time to relax that external anal sphincter and release food we ate in that first video. Ahh, and, finally, that we've got here, man, do we feel relieved? (toilet flushing)."
Health,"So it'll all build up from this video. So what I've done here is I've copy and pasted two images of proteins from Wikipedia. This is myosin. It's actually myosin II because you actually have two strands of the myosin protein. They're interwound around each other so you can see it's this very complex looking protein or enzyme, however you want to talk about it. I'll tell you why it's called an enzyme-- because it actually helps react ATP into ADP and phosphate groups. So that's why it's called an ATPase."
Health,"It's a subclass of the ATPase enzymes. This right here is actin. What we're going to see in this video is how myosin essentially uses the ATP to essentially crawl along. You can almost view it as an actin rope and that's what creates mechanical energy. So let me draw it. I'll actually draw it on this actin right here. So let's say we have one of these myosin heads. So when I say a myosin head, this is one of the myosin heads right here and then it's connected, it's interwound, it's woven around."
Health,"This is the other one and it winds around that way. Now let's just say we're just dealing with one of the myosin heads. Let's say it's in this position. Let me see how well I can draw it. Let's say it starts off in a position that looks like that and then this is kind of the tail part that connects to some other structural and we'll talk about that in more detail, but this is my myosin head right there in its starting position, not doing anything."
Health,"Now, ATP can come along and bond to this myosin head, this enzyme, this protein, this ATPase enzyme. So let me draw some ATP. So ATP comes along and bonds to this guy right here. Let's say that's the-- and it's not going to be this big relative to the protein, but this is just to give you the idea. So soon as the ATP binds to its appropriate site on this enzyme or protein, the enzyme, it detaches from the actin. So let me write this down."
Health,"So one, ATP binds to myosin head and as soon as that happens, that causes the myosin to release actin. So that's step one. So I start it off with this guy just touching the actin, the ATP comes, and it gets released. So in the next step-- so after that step, it's going to look something like this-- and I want to draw it in the same place. After the next step, it's going to look something like this. It will have released. So now it looks something like that and you have the ATP attached to it still."
Health,"I know it might be a little bit convoluted when I keep writing over the same thing, but you have the ATP attached to it. Now the next step-- the ATP hydrolizes, the phosphate gets pulled off of it. This is an ATPase enzyme. That's what it does. Let me write that down. And what that does, that releases the energy to cock this myosin protein into kind of a high energy state. So let me do step two. This thing-- it gets hydrolized. It releases energy."
Health,"We know that ATP is the energy currency of biological systems. So it releases energy. I'm drawing it as a little spark or explosion, but you can really imagine it's changing the conformation of-- it kind of spring-loads this protein right here to go into a state so it's ready to crawl along the myosin. So in step two-- plus energy, energy and then this-- you can say it cocks the myosin protein or enzyme to high energy. You can imagine it winds the spring, or loads the spring."
Health,"And conformation for proteins just mean shape. So step two-- what happens is the phosphate group gets-- they're still attached, but it gets detached from the rest of the ATP. So that becomes ADP and that energy changes the conformation so that this protein now goes into a position that looks like this. So this is where we end up at the end of step two. Let me make sure I do it right. So at the end of step two, it might look something like this. So the end of step two, the protein looks something like this."
Health,"This is in its cocked position. It has a lot of energy right now. It's wound up in this position. You still have your ADP. You still have your-- that's your adenosine and let's say you have your two phosphate groups on the ADP and you still have one phosphate group right there. Now, when that phosphate group releases-- so let me write this as step three. Remember, when we started, we were just sitting here."
Health,"The ATP binds on step one-- actually, it does definitely bind, at the end of step one, that causes the myosin protein to get released. Then after step one, we naturally have step two. The ATP hydrolyzes into ADP phosphate. That releases energy and that allows the myosin protein to get cocked into this high energy position and kind of attach, you can think of it, to the next rung of our actin filament. Now we're in a high energy state. In step three, the phosphate releases."
Health,"The phosphate is released from myosin in step three. That's step three right there. That's a phosphate group being released. And what this does is, this releases that energy of that cocked position and it causes this myosin protein to push on the actin. This is the power stroke, if you imagine in an engine. This is what's causing the mechanical movement. So when the phosphate group is actually released-- remember, the original release is when you take ATP to ADP in a phosphate."
Health,"That put it in this spring-loaded position. When the phosphate releases it, this releases the spring. And what that does is it pushes on the actin filament. So you could view this as the power stroke. We're actually creating mechanical energy. So depending on which one you want to view as fixed-- if you view the actin as fixed, whatever myosin is attached to it would move to the left. If you imagine the myosin being fixed, the actin and whatever it's attached to would move to the right, either way."
Health,"But this is where we fundamentally get the muscle action. And then step four-- you have the ADP released. And then we're exactly where we were before we did step one, except we're just one rung further to the left on the actin molecule. So to me, this is pretty amazing. We actually are seeing how ATP energy can be used to-- we're going from chemical energy or bond energy in ATP to mechanical energy."
Health,"For me, that's amazing because when I first learned about ATP-- people say, you use ATP to do everything in your cells and contract muscles. Well, gee, how do you go from bond energy to actually contracting things, to actually doing what we see in our everyday world as mechanical energy? And this is really where it all occurs. This is really the core issue that's going on here."
Health,"And you have to say, well, gee, how this thing change shape and all that? And you have to remember, these proteins, based on what's bonded to it and what's not bonded to it, they change shape. And some of those shapes take more energy to attain, and then if you do the right things, that energy can be released and then it can push another protein. But I find this just fascinating. And now we can build up from this actin and myosin interactions to understand how muscles actually work.."
Health,"That causes it to be released. Then the ATP hydrolyzes into ADP and a phosphate group. And when that happens, that energy's released. It puts this into a higher energy state. It kind of spring-loads the protein and then it attaches up another notch on the actual actin filament and then the phosphate group leaves and that's where the confirmation change in this protein is enough."
Health,"It generates the power stroke to actually push on the actin filament-- and you could imagine, either move the myosin-- whatever the myosin is connected to-- to the left or whatever the actin is connected to to the right. We're going to talk a lot more about what they're connected to in future videos. Now, a couple of questions might have been raising in your head."
Health,"This guy had so much effort to pull on this thing, right? There's some tension pulling in the other direction, right? I said this is what happens in muscles, so there must be some weight or some other resistance. So what happens when this releases? At the first step when ATP joined and this released, wouldn't the actin filament just go back to where it was before? Especially if there's some tension on it going in that direction."
Health,"And the simple answer to that is, this isn't the only myosin protein that's acting on this actin. You have others all along the chain. Maybe you have one right there. Maybe you have one right there. They're all working at their own pace at different times. So you have so many of these that when one of them is disengaged, another one of them might be in their power stroke or another one might be engaged."
Health,"So it's not like you have this notion of, if all of a sudden one lets go, that the actin filament will recoil back to where it was. Now the next question that you might be thinking is, how do I turn on and off this situation? We have command over our muscles. What can turn on or off this system of the myosin essentially crawling up the actin? And to understand that, there's two other proteins that come into effect. That's tropomyosin and troponin."
Health,"And so I'm going to redraw the actin-- I'll do a very rough drawing of the actin filament. Let's say that that's my actin filament right there with its little grooves. It's actually a helical structure. And actually, these grooves-- it's kind of a helical-- but we won't worry too much about that. What we drew so far, at least in the last video, you had these little myosin."
Health,"You can view them as feet or head or whatever that keep attaching to it and then based on where they are in that ATP cycle, they can keep getting cranked back up or spring-loaded and go to the next one and push back. Now, on top of this actin, you actually have this tropomyosin protein. And this tropomyosin protein, it coils around the actin. So this is our actin right here. This is one of the two heads of the myosin II. And then we have our tropomyosin. Tropomyosin is coiled around."
Health,"It's a very rough sketch, but you can imagine it's coiled around and it goes back behind it, then it goes like that, and then it goes back behind it, then it goes like that. So it's coiled around it and the important thing about it is, if there's-- let me take a step back. It's coiled around and it's attached to the actin by another protein called troponin. Let's say it's attached there and-- this isn't exact, but let's say it's attached there, and there, and there, and there, and there by the troponin."
Health,"So let me write this down. So you can imagine, the troponin is kind of like the nails into the actin. So it dictates where the tropomyosin is. So when a muscle is not contracting, it turns out that the tropomyosin is blocking the myosin from being able to-- and I've read a bunch of accounts on this and I think this is still an area of research. It's not 100% clear one way or the other."
Health,"Tropomyosin is-- or maybe both-- blocking the myosin from being able to attach to the actin where it normally attaches so it won't be able to crawl up the actin-- or sometimes the myosin is attached to the actin, but it keeps it from releasing and sliding up the actin to keep that walking procedure."
Health,"So the bottom line is that this tropomyosin kind of blocks the myosin head-- this is the myosin head right there-- from crawling up the actin, either by physically blocking its actual binding site or if it's already bound, keeping it from being able to keep sliding up the actin. Either way, it's blocking it and the only way to make it unblocked is for the troponins to actually change their confirmation, for them to change their shape."
Health,"And the only way for them to change their shape is if we have a high calcium ion concentration. So if you have a bunch of calcium ions, if you have a high enough concentration, these calcium ions are going to bond to the troponin and then that changes the confirmation of the troponin enough to move the configuration of the tropomyosin. So let me write this down."
Health,"So normally, tropomyosin blocks, but then when you have a high calcium ion concentration, they bind to troponin and then the troponin, they change their confirmation so it moves the tropomyosin out of the way. So when it moves out of the way, you have a high calcium concentration, bonds troponin, moves tropomyosin out of the way, then all of a sudden what we talked about in the last video-- these guys can start walking up the actin or pushing the actin to the right, however you want to view it."
Health,"But then if the calcium concentration goes low, then the calciums get released from the troponin. You need to have enough to always hang around here. If the concentration becomes really low here, these guys will start to leave. So then the troponin goes back to, I guess, standard confirmation. That makes the tropomyosin block the myosin again. So it's actually-- I mean, I can't say anything here is simple."
Health,"This was only discovered maybe 50 or 60 years ago and you can imagine to actually observe these things or to create experiments to definitively know what's happening-- nothing is simple, but the idea is simple. Without calcium, the tropomyosin is blocking the ability of the myosin to attach where it needs to attach or slide up the actin so it can keep pushing on it."
Health,"But if the calcium concentration is high enough, they will bond to the troponin-- which essentially nails down the tropomyosin that's wound around the actin and when they change their confirmation with the calcium ions, it moves the tropomyosin out of the way so that the myosin can do what it does. So you can imagine already, we're building up a way for-- one, for muscles to contract, but even better, for us to control muscles to contract."
Health,"So if we have a high calcium concentration within the cell, the muscle will contract. If we have a low calcium concentration again, then all of a sudden, these will release. They'll be blocked, and then the muscle will relax again.."
Health,"And that's just some tendon that's on either side of our muscle, our bicep right here. And the tendon attaches our muscle over to some bone, so there's a little bone right there. There's a little bone right there. Label these guys. So that's one bone end, and then here's another one. So if it's our bicep, it's anchored onto our humerus. This is our bicep, right? So I'll just draw it in the arm. Here, this guy's sort of flexing right there, coming down to the elbow. There."
Health,"And if we want a better idea of what's going on here in this bicep, this muscle, why don't we just take a cut. So let me just cut right about there. We've got a cross-sectional look at what's going on in our muscle. So here's a little cut we just did right about here. Our muscle just hanging out in the middle, sort of that same shape that comes down about here. And we've still got our tendon, of course, that's anchoring our muscle over to our bone. Don't forget the tendon that's still right here."
Health,"And the tendon is just a type of connective tissue, and this is somewhat continuous with the connective tissue that covers the outermost layer of our muscle right here. So I'm just drawing that in. This outer layer of muscle we've got here is called the epimysium, and that's continuous with the tendon, and it's supposed to help protect our muscle here so it doesn't shear against the bone or all the other things that are in the compartment of our arm, if we're talking about the bicep."
Health,"But as you know, this can apply to the muscles in our leg or in our jaw when we're chewing-- anything that we control. So in addition to this connective tissue layer, there's another connective tissue layer that's on the inside right here, underneath the epimysium. And so this connective tissue layer I'll just draw as a circle or as a sheath that's kind of sitting around here. This guy is called the perimysium, and this perimysium covers subunits of muscle that sit right here."
Health,"And there's a bunch of them, and they all have their own names. So I'll take this one right here and just kind of draw it out a little more so we can take a closer look inside. So this little dude right here, this muscle subunit that's covered by this perimysium that I'm shading in right here. This is called a fascicle. It's got two names, actually. So it can be called a fascicle-- fas-kick-el-- C-I-C-L-E. It's also known as a fasciculus."
Health,"So it depends on whether you're talking about fascicles or a single fasciculus, whatever term you want to use. And then within each of the fascicles, there's another connective tissue layer. This is called the endomysium. Now, this covers individual muscle cells. So finally, we've reached the individual muscle cells. I'll draw one of these dudes coming out right here. This is an individual muscle cell that's covered by the endomysium."
Health,"And so the muscle cell that I'm writing out over here-- it has a special name, as well. So we can call it a muscle cell, but we can also call it a myo-- myo meaning muscle-- fiber. So this is shaped like a fiber, because it is longer than it is wide. And again, this endomysium, just like the perimysium, contains nerves and blood vessels that can help conduct neuronal signals and blood towards the individual myofiber and the connective tissue that sits around here."
Health,"OK, so now that we've gotten to the muscle cell, why don't we just scroll down a little bit and just focus in on this guy. Now, while we might be tempted to draw the muscle cell just kind of like that fiber that I just drew over there, like this sort of rectangle, we remember in fact that it's shaped a little differently-- like a pipe that has a couple of bumps outside."
Health,"Do you guys remember? Why do we have bumps on the outside of our muscle cells or the outside of our myofibers? I think I heard one of you said, because there are nuclei that sit on the outskirts of our muscle cells. And that is absolutely correct. This is a single nucleus that I'm drawing right here. Here's one nucleus."
Health,"And this is sort of the storage unit of DNA that can help us replicate or make more of our myofibers or our muscle cells, and they sit on the outskirts of our myofiber, towards sort of the edge of our plasma membrane. This plasma membrane has a special name in muscle. It's called the sarcolemma. We've got a couple of important prefixes that we mentioned here. Remember I mentioned myo from above? Myo just means muscle. Just keep that in the back of your mind."
Health,"And then sarco-- whenever you see sarco, that refers to just flesh. And we often see this in the context of muscle because the covering of our muscle cell right here, that membrane, we call it the sarcolemma. The cytoplasm right here that's within the muscle cell-- we call that the sarcoplasm. And as we get further in, we're also going to talk about the sarcomere. And so we're talking about our myofiber right here-- let me just make it look a little more tubular."
Health,"So the myofiber itself, this muscle cell, has a bunch of smaller units within it, too. And these smaller units are where we have our main contractions occurring. So I'm going to draw one of these guys out right here, and this is just called the myo-- like muscle-- fibril. Not fiber, but myofibril. Now we've come to where we're storing our myosin and our actin that's sitting inside here. This is where the actual contraction will occur."
Health,"So if we look at our muscle cells under a microscope, we'll see that they've got these striations on them, these bands, because remember, another name for skeletal muscle is striated skeletal muscle. So they have these lines that are here that you'll see under a microscope. So if we blow that up-- let me just get some space down here to talk about it. So if I were to draw just a blown-up version of it right here, we'd have our striation line right there. I'll draw another one right here and right here."
Health,"Just put it in this line in this box right here. And we have all these bands that we would see under the microscope, right? So we have the striations that are on the sides, and there are these bands that are kind of going across this unit right here that we're looking at. Now, what are these striations right here? Well, we talked about these before. Sal mentioned these are the z-lines. So the z-lines are these striations we see under the microscope, and so I've drawn three of them here for you guys."
Health,"Z-lines, then we'll just connect that one back here. And remember, the space between two z-lines, going from here all the way to here-- that's the sarcomere, and this is our most basic unit of contraction. This is where we're going to have our actin and our myosin fibers interact and have us flex, at our most macro level we'll get back to in a second. And there are different parts of the sarcomere, right? There is the part that's designated the A-band that's in the middle."
Health,"There's this other part up here called the I-band. All right. So let's focus in on a single sarcomere right here. So I'm drawing the outskirts of our sarcomere, of course, so that's going to be our z-line. That's hanging out on either side. I've drawn two of them here. Anchored to our Z-line is going to be our actin filaments. Here are the actin filaments that we've heard about before. I'll just label this. This is our actin filament."
Health,"Remember, sitting inside is going to be our myosin, and our myosin filament-- remember, it's got two heads and it's associated right here with the actin. It wants to kind of pull on the actin and just crawl along the actin. I'll draw one here, as well. Myosin heads-- two myosin heads right there. And they're attached top and bottom like that. And they just want to walk across, all right? I want to make sure that I draw that here, too. And you get the picture down here."
Health,"And so anchoring our myosin filaments in the sarcomere is going to be titin. We'll just draw the titin here. It's not attached to the ends of the myosin, but you can kind of see that it's holding it in place from somewhere deeper in right there. So that's our titin. And again, this is our myosin, this guy. Myosin filaments with the two heads that come up. And at this point, we can appreciate some of the bands we talked about over here. The part that's both myosin and actin is called the A-band."
Health,"That's the A-band that we drew on the left side over here. And the part that's only actin that doesn't involve any of the myosin-- that's this point right here, and it continues on into the other sarcomere. This is the I-band. The I-band. And the way I think about it, I kind of looks like a one, right? So it's got one of our two major filaments. And then A is the alternative one, the other one, that's got myosin and actin in it. So that's the A-band and the I-band."
Health,"So now when you recall-- so there's this axon fiber that's going to come in and release a message, an action potential that's going to come here and depolarize our sarcolemma. It's going to sort of spread everywhere. It's not just going to go in one direction. And one of the things that we have in our sarcolemma are t-tubules that can allow the depolarization, or this action potential, to go deep within our muscle cell or our myofiber to cause the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium."
Health,"Calcium then, as you remember, goes on to bind troponin. Troponin that's sitting on our actin will then tell tropomyosin, get the heck out of the way. And then our myosin filaments that we drew right here can go ahead and use ATP to sort of walk along our actin filaments. And so they would sort of walk along this way, and they would, relatively to the actin filament, stand still. They would be crawling this way, but wouldn't really do any of the moving. They'd be anchored down."
Health,"It's the actin filaments, actually, that move. The actin filaments are going to be moving closer in to the center, and that effectively causes our I-band to get smaller. The I-band is going to get smaller when we have our sarcomere contract. And because the A-band involves however far the myosin spreads, the A-band does not change. Only the I-band changes here, as we effectively bring the two z-lines closer to each other and shorten the length of our sarcomere."
Health,"And that's what's happening on our most micro-molecular level right here, with the sarcomere contracting. And all of that began with this axon fiber spreading the signal. So I hope you can appreciate, just kind of going from the top right here, when we're contracting our skeletal muscle and we go through all these smaller layers, what's happening at this molecular level right here. What's allowing us to contract, to flex our arm or kick a ball or do something of that nature."
Health,And I hope that you found all this to be somewhat useful to you..
Health,"This is the end of an axon, which is the part of a neuron that casts a signal away. And it looks like this. It gets larger at the end right here. And then it tapers back off like that. Muscle cells sits adjacent to these axon terminals at the neuromuscular junction, and kind of look like a block, but not exactly. They have these in-foldings that I'm drawing right here, these in-pouchings."
Health,"And why does nature cause in-pouchings to occur? What's the purpose of these guys? What function do they serve? Well, if you said that it serves to increase surface area, you're absolutely right. Because with the increased surface area, we're going to have extra space where we can have sodium channels present that will help us transmit a message into the muscle cell. And so it's not just present on the outside, but there are a bunch of sodium channels that are deep inside as well."
Health,"And in addition to sodium channels, you definitely have calcium channels that are present as well. They are situated buried deep within your muscle cells, too, to make sure that the most deepest parts of your muscle cells will get an influx of calcium when it's the right time. And to foreshadow a point we'll discuss later, I'm going to draw another muscle cell right here, just kind of chilling out on its own."
Health,"So now how does the axon send a message to the muscle cell? Well, if you recall, there's going to be a signal that's cast away from our motor neuron to this axon terminal. And that signal is in the form of an influx of sodium ions. So this is a depolarized membrane that propagates this signal to this axon terminal. But it's not just sodium that's influxing. You're also going to have some calcium that's running in as well. And the calcium here is actually going to play a major role."
Health,"Because in our axon terminal, we have a bunch of vesicles that are sitting around in here. These are just little pockets that are waiting for something to happen. And in each of these pockets, we have a message that's waiting to be released into the space between our axon terminal and the muscle cell. This message is called a neurotransmitter, which is a very well-named scientific term. Because all this is is a molecule that the neuron uses to transmit a message."
Health,"And so the neurotransmitter that we use in the neuromuscular junction is called acetyl-- like from chemistry, acetyl-- choline, acetylcholine. And oftentimes, you'll see it abbreviated as ACh. So when there's an influx of calcium into the axon terminal, what'll happen is that the calcium will actually bind to our vesicle. There are proteins that are on it that'll grab onto the calcium."
Health,"And so when there's calcium attached to these proteins, the vesicle will be drawn to this axon terminal membrane and actually fuse with it to become one continuous membrane. As a result, we release the acetylcholine into this space we call the synaptic cleft. The synaptic cleft is just the space between our presynaptic membrane, the membrane of our axon terminal, as well as our postsynaptic membrane, which is just the membrane of our muscle cell. So this is our postsynaptic membrane."
Health,"All right, and so we have a bunch of acetylcholine that's released into the synaptic cleft and is ready to send a message on. But let's take a minute here. What just happened here with the membrane? I mean, the vesicle literally became one with the membrane of the axon terminal. What would you call this, if you have to give it a name? Well, it looks like some compound within the cell exited the cell. So I'll say ""exo."" And it exited a cell, so a ""cyte""-- exocytosis."
Health,"Exocytosis, and that's the process of molecules, or substrates, leaving a cell by vesicles fusing with membranes. And so that's what we do when we want things to leave cells. The exact opposite process, where we have things enter cells by fusion of vesicles, is called endocytosis. And these are very important terms keep in mind. Great, so now we've got acetylcholine all over our synaptic cleft."
Health,"What is it going to do here? Well, these sodium channels have receptors that sit on them that are called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. And as the name suggests, acetylcholine can come and very snuggly sit here and send a message to this sodium channel that it's time to open and cause sodium to influx into our muscle cell. And that's going to happen across the membrane, causing a large amount of sodium to enter. And once we've depolarized the membrane enough, calcium will even start to enter."
Health,"And so in this way, we'll have what's referred to as voltage-gated calcium release. All right, and so we have all this calcium that's entering the cell. Now what? Well, this is just one cell contracting. How does this make me able to do the worm, or to kick a ball, or to high five my best bro? Well, we can't just have calcium entering through the membrane. There's another reservoir within our muscle cells that releases calcium for our disposal."
Health,"This reservoir-- kind of a large name, and I'll write it out right here-- is called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, R-E-T-I-C-U-L-U-M, sarcoplasmic reticulum. This guy holds a whole bunch of calcium. It's sitting in there waiting to be released, waiting to do something. So there are proteins that are attached to the membrane of the muscle cell."
Health,"And they're just waiting for enough calcium to be present here so that one of these calcium cations could bind this protein complex and then effectively cause calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This process is called calcium-induced calcium release. And so now we have a bunch of calcium in here, and this muscle cell will be contracting. But it's still just one muscle cell. What's the big deal? Well, this muscle cell is attached to its neighbor right here, actually."
Health,"There are proteins that link muscle cells together. These proteins are called gap junctions. And they allow for cations to flow from one muscle cell into another. So these muscle cells aren't really separate at all. Actually, they're connected because of this gap junction and actually continuous. And there's a term that we use to drive home the fact that we can have our calcium cations move to this other muscle cell and to start a calcium-induced calcium release process here."
Health,"And it's that our muscle cells are in a syncytium. What does that mean? Well, ""cyte,"" just like we talked about her, just means a cell. And ""syn"" means that these muscle cells are in a synergy with each other. When one contracts, it causes its neighbor to contract as well, and that's how we scale up."
Health,"Because when muscle cells start contracting as neighbors, you get the entire neighborhood contracting, because you can then scale up and imagine that not just muscle cells, but muscle fascicles will also be contracting, too, to produce a kick of a ball or the worm."
Health,"So this signal that started from our axon terminal here that begins as just depolarization turns into an acetylcholine molecule that undergoes exocytosis to end up in the synaptic cleft, where it binds a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to cause sodium to enter a muscle cell, and over time, calcium to enter a muscle cell, which would then cause calcium-induced calcium release, which can then go to an adjacent muscle cell to cause a synergy of muscle contraction that spans from muscle cell to muscle cell, from fascicle to fascicle."
Health,And that's what happens at the neuromuscular junction..
Health,"And I thought it would be helpful to have a picture, because then we can actually draw on there and show where the different types of muscles might be. So when I mention muscles, the word I want you to start thinking about in your head is movement. So think about all the different types of movements that might happen in your body. Just be really creative and start thinking of all the different movements. You might have, for example-- a really easy one would be, maybe, let's say your leg is moving."
Health,"I'm going to just draw on our picture as we talk. But let's say your leg is moving because you're playing soccer. And so you've got this giant muscle in here, and this muscle is attached to a bone. Right? There's a little bone here. I guess not so little, right? This as the largest bone in the body. It's called the femur. And so this muscle is attached to the femur. And this muscle is going to be attached by way of tendon. It's going to have tendons on both sides."
Health,"And so this tendon is attaching it to the bone and allowing it to act on the bones. So this is an example of skeletal muscle. Right? So this skeletal muscle is going to be attached to a tendon and bone. Now, that brings up the question-- does every skeletal muscle have to be attached to a tendon and bone? Well, the answer is no, actually. There are some muscles that really aren't attached to tendons at all. In fact, right above the muscle we just drew is a muscle called the external oblique muscle."
Health,"And don't worry so much about the names. But the idea here is that this muscle is actually not attached to a tendon. Well, in a sense, I guess, you could think of it as a tendon, but it's like a flat tendon. Basically a giant kind of sheet of fibrous tissue. And this fibrous tissue, is it floating in midair? It's going to be connected to fibrous tissue on the other side, because, of course, your body is symmetric and so you've got fibrous tissue on the other side."
Health,"And you guessed it, on the other side of that you've got another external oblique. So you've got these muscles that are kind of coming in to not really a tendon but really a flat tendon, or something that looks like a flat tendon, and we call that an aponeurosis. You might hear these words. I just want you to be familiar with them. And now if someone asks you, is every muscle in the body attached to a tendon and bone? You can say no. Some are attached to a flat tendon called an aponeurosis."
Health,"The idea here is that you can kind of start identifying skeletal muscles. They're usually the muscles that you can see on your body. Actually, I don't even need to put quotes. That's the actual name for it. No need for quotes there. So you can identify skeletal muscles pretty easily. But what about the other two? What about the cardiac and smooth muscle? I mean, you might wonder, does cardiac mean heart? And is that the only type of cardiac muscle out there? And the answer is yes."
Health,"This is your heart muscle right here. And the only type of cardiac muscle that we have in our body would be related to the heart. So in the heart, you can find specialized cells that were so interesting and different from skeletal and smooth muscles, they got their own name and category. These are the cardiac cells. And you can only find them in the heart. I guess we're making a column of where you can find these cells."
Health,"So what about smooth muscle? Where can you find smooth muscle? Well, for smooth muscle, think about any hollow organ. Any organ that's got space on the inside and blood vessels. Those are the two major categories. Those aren't the only ones, but those are the major ones. That'll get you about 95% of the way there. So blood vessels and hollow organs are what you should think about. And hollow organs could be anything from-- let's say, your stomach would be a hollow organ."
Health,"Let me just put these examples here. Or your bowels would be a hollow organ, anything like that. So I'm just going to write stomach here just to jog your memory. Where there's basically some empty cavity on the inside. Right? And then as for blood vessels, just remember one of the largest blood vessels, for example, is the aorta. And the aorta kind of comes up and over like that. And it's kind of like a hollow organ, as well. Right? I mean, there's a space on the inside of that blood vessel."
Health,"And blood is usually flowing through that space, but at least it's hollow. So it's really not that different conceptually from the hollow organ. And just like in the hollow organ, the smooth muscle is in the walls of these things. So think about where the smooth muscle would be. It would be in the walls of the hollow organ or in the walls of the blood vessel. So that tells you where to find these different muscle types."
Health,"Right? And thinking about movement, smooth muscle can help the stomach, for example, move food forward. Cardiac muscle is going to help your heart beat. That's a pretty important movement. And skeletal muscle, I mean, we use that every single day. Every time you give your friend a high five or give your mom a hug, those are skeletal muscles that are helping your body move around. Right? So let's move on. Let's think about some other differences between these categories."
Health,"Let's talk about now the movement control. So who controls the movement? Do you control it, or is it automatically done? So smooth muscle is what I would consider automatic, or I'm going to call it involuntary because you'll probably see that word more often. Involuntary just means that your body is automatically taking care of it. And the same is true for your cardiac muscle-- involuntary. Meaning, you don't have to actually think about the next heartbeat. It just happens automatically."
Health,"Right? And skeletal muscle is the opposite-- there, it's voluntary. Meaning if I didn't want to get up, then I would not get up. Or if I didn't want to go running, then I wouldn't go running. All of those movements in my body are under my control. I can decide when to do those things."
Health,"Right? Actually, maybe I'll draw little arrows here-- what about speed? Which ones are fast, and which ones are slow? So up here, the smooth muscle is the slowest and the skeletal muscle would be the fastest, which is pretty cool because the voluntary stuff-- the stuff you control yourself-- is the fastest. And the stuff that's happening automatically is pretty slow. And actually it's nice, because cardiac muscle is somewhere in between the two. Somewhere in the middle."
Health,"So when your blood vessels get tinier or they get big and vasodilate, all that stuff is happening on a pretty slow time scale as compared to, let's say, I jump and try to catch a ball. That's all happening really, really quickly. Thousands of little muscle movements are happening really lightning quick. And so those would be the fastest. Now the final thing I'm going to draw is what these things look like."
Health,"So how do they look? If you actually take a look at these cells-- let's actually look at each of these one by one and figure out what they would look like. So the smooth muscle actually looks like a little eye, or like an almond-- sometimes it's described that way. But I think of it as an eye. One single eye. And you can see that the edges, or the ends, are kind of tapered like that. And so sometimes you'll see that these are described as spindle shaped."
Health,"I think that's kind of a holdover from a time period long ago when people thought about spindles more than they do now. And the other thing, it's got one nuclei. Drew that right in the middle. One nuclei. And it's in the middle of the cell. So that's basically what a smooth muscle cell looks like. What about a cardiac cell? Well, this cell is branched. That's actually one of the most interesting hallmark features of it. Now, not every single cardiac cell is branched."
Health,"Some are actually just kind of humdrum-looking, normal, maybe like this. But the fact that you can find branched ones is what really makes these so easy to recognize. If you look at a whole bunch-- I'm going to erase this guy now that you know he exists, but I'm going to focus on the branched one because these are the ones that make them very easy to spot. And they also have nuclei. Sometimes one, but sometimes two, which is interesting because, you know, usually you think, one cell, one nuclei."
Health,"But the reason I had to point that out for the smooth muscle cell, that there's only one, is that sometimes these cardiac cells have more than one. So the two features-- I'm going to just write out here-- branched and one or two nuclei. Not always two, but they can have two. And they're also located kind of in the middle of this cell. And I'll show you what I mean by middle when I draw the skeletal muscle. I'll do that now. This is the skeletal muscle, and it's got something like this."
Health,"It's got these little outpouchings I'm trying to draw for you. And you'll see in just a second what I'm drawing. These are little spots on the edge, or on the periphery, for nuclei. And notice that there's not one nuclei, not two nuclei, but bunches of nuclei. So these cells are actually working as a giant cell, in a sense. So these are actually, first of all, they're straight. They're not branched. So straight. And they've got many nuclei."
Health,"This is actually really, really important, and you can see how it would be easy to spot these guys, right? Because they've got many nuclei, and the nuclei themselves are in the periphery, kind of on the edges. That's why I wanted to point out that the other two are in the middle. Now, kind of a final point is that if you were to look at these under a microscope-- and actually, this is something that was noticed a long time ago-- they would look something like this. And this is called striated."
Health,"So they basically have these striations. But notice that the smooth muscle cells don't have this. It's really just the skeletal muscle and the cardiac muscle that has these striations. Sometimes you'll hear about striated muscle, and they could be talking about either of the two. Right? They could be talking about cardiac or skeletal, but you know that they're not talking about the smooth muscle. So this is striated. And striated just refers to those stripes."
Health,And that's what it looks like under a microscope. And we'll talk about exactly why they're striated what that would imply about the cell in another video. But I just want you to get a kind of a rough lay of the land. And now you can see there's actually some interesting stuff here. You have some similarities between the cardiac and the smooth muscle. They're both involuntary. You've got some similarities between the skeletal and the cardiac. They're both striated.
Health,"And so you can see how all three are somehow similar, but also somehow different from one another.."
Health,"So what I do is I get back at them. I come up with one golden rule. And this one golden rule will help me go through a table, like we're about to do right here, to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers. So the golden rule I'm going to have for this table here is that mitochondria-- whoops, look how I wrote that ""i"" there. Mitochondria are present in greater quantities in your type 1 muscle fibers, type 1. So mitochondria are more prevalent in type 1 muscle fibers than in type 2."
Health,"And just based on that knowledge alone, we should be able to go through and fill out this table. All right, so let's start from the top. I may have alluded to it here through the way I wrote this out, but the color type 1 muscle fibers are often noted as? And why do you think that is? Well, what are mitochondria used for? Mitochondria are used in biochemical processes that help us make energy."
Health,"And the main process they function in that I'm going to reference a couple of times is called oxidative phosphorylation. Now, what is that term mean to you? What does that suggest? What are the two things that are probably involved in oxidative phosphorylation? So just as the name suggests, oxidative means oxygen is going to be involved here. And then phosphorylation means that something is going to receive a phosphate group. Phosphoryl- -ation, something will receive a phosphate group."
Health,"So the oxidative part applies here to red, the same way that the color red shows up in our arteries. Think about it. Why are arteries red, and why are veins blue? Well, arteries have more oxygen than veins do. And because of that, the color of our type 1 muscle fibers will be red because they produce more energy from oxygen than type 2 muscle fibers do. More oxygen is present in type 1, so they're red. And so we could say then that our type 2 muscle fibers will be white."
Health,"All right, what about the speed of contraction that we see here? How fast do type 1 muscle fibers contract? Well, let's think about the process of making energy with mitochondria. If type 1 muscle fibers rely on mitochondria for energy, think about all the processes that have to go into making energy through oxidative phosphorylation. You can't just do this right away. You have to have glycolysis happen. You have to have the Krebs cycle occur."
Health,"You need to make NADH and FADH2, all of these cofactors that have to go into this electron transport chain. There's a lot of things that have to be done. So mitochondria take a while to make energy. So that means that the contraction speed here is also going to be slow because it takes a while to make that energy. And so on the flip side, that means that the contraction speed of type 2, or white muscle fibers, is going to be fast."
Health,"What about the conduction velocity? How quickly are we going to be able to receive a neuronal impulse or a nerve signal to type 1 muscle fibers to contract? This is also going to be slow. And the term here is called ""slow twitch."" And I remember that the same way I remember that the contraction speed is slow in type 1 muscle fibers. On the flip side, we call type 2 muscle fibers fast twitch muscle fibers."
Health,"All right, now, what types of activities do you think type 1 muscle fibers are going to be involved in? Well, oxidative phosphorylation has another name. The mitochondria is used for a specific type of respiration. That's a cue term right there. That's something that should cue another word in your mind. If mitochondria is involved for a type of cellular respiration, that type of -- aerobic. Aerobic respiration requires mitochondria to be present."
Health,"And so because there's more mitochondria in type 1 muscle fibers, type 1 muscle fibers will undergo aerobic respiration. What about type 2? Well, because they don't have as much mitochondria, they're going to have to undergo anaerobic respiration, or respiration in the absence of oxygen."
Health,"That's what a aerobic means-- ""by using oxygen."" Anaerobic means ""without oxygen."" OK, how long will these muscle fibers be contracting? Well, let's think about how much energy we're making if we have mitochondria versus if we don't have mitochondria. We make a lot more energy if we have mitochondria. And so the duration of contraction then will be long. You're going to have longer contractions when you're able to make a lot more energy or ATP, because you've got mitochondria present in greater quantities."
