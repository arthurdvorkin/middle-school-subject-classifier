Each layer has its own unique characteristics and plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and weather."
1,"And to kind of understand this, we can actually make a comparison here between food and wood. So what I mean by that is that the molecules in food interact with the molecules on our bodies in two primary ways. The first is as a source of molecular building blocks, or in other words, molecules the body can use to build new structures. And the second is going to be as a source of molecules for fuel, much like a campfire or firewood, like what we have here.."

0,"One useful strategy for mental math is rounding. To estimate a sum, round each number to the nearest ten, add the rounded numbers, then adjust by the difference between the original numbers and the rounded numbers. For example, to estimate 48 + 36, round 48 to 50 and 36 to 40. Adding 50 + 40 gives you 90, then adjust by subtracting 2 (50 - 48) and 4 (40 - 36) to get 86, which is a close estimate to the actual sum. This method helps simplify calculations and improve accuracy in mental math.."

So I'm just drawing that in. This outer layer of muscle we've got here is called the epimysium, and that's continuous with the tendon, and it's supposed to help protect our muscle here so it doesn't shear against the bone or all the other things that are in the compartment of our arm, if we're talking about the bicep.."
2,"The way your imagination renders a character is going to be different from how someone else's imagination does it. So let's compare the script for this audio drama we've got on Khan Academy, Hands Off My Phone, and let's compare that against the recorded version. So first, I'm going to put up the script and I'd like you to pause the video and just read it to yourself very quickly. And now let's take a listen to the recorded version.

Now, there are actually separate names for the two layers. So for example, the layer that's kind of hugging up against the heart, this layer that I'm drawing right now, this layer is called the visceral pericardium. So you call that the visceral pericardium. And the name visceral, this right here, would be visceral.."

One of the most famous explorers of this era was Christopher Columbus, who sailed west from Spain in 1492 in search of a new route to Asia but instead landed in the Americas. The explorations of Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan also played significant roles in expanding European knowledge of the world and establishing trade routes with Asia."
5,"So the first part that we have is actually just skeletal muscle. So it's under our voluntary control. Skeletal muscle. And so that's 1/3, I'll say the top 1/3 of the esophagus. In the middle right here, we actually have a mix. We have skeletal under our control, plus smooth muscle. And they kind of work together. So it's sort of in our control, but also not really. So that's going to be the middle 1/3 of the esophagus. The middle 1/3.."

But the global wind patterns, which we call prevailing winds, look like they curved the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This curving has to do with the rotation of Earth and is called the Coriolis effect.."
4,"The analogy that's often made is originally the federal idea was kind of like a layered cake, so this is my best attempt at drawing a quick layered cake, where you could view each layer as one of the layers of government. So when I cut open that cake, maybe right over here this blue layer right over here, it's blue flavored cake, maybe it's an ice cream cake of some kind, that might be the federal government. Then this yellow, maybe it's mango-flavored, that would be the state government.."

And this general pattern of German aggression, [allowed] by the other powers in Europe essentially allowing it to happen -- and, in particular, Great Britain allowing it to happen -- has been referred to as a 'policy of appeasement.' Obviously, the word 'appeasement' means there is someone who is angry about something, and you just don't want to make them any angrier -- you just let them do whatever they want -- this is, essentially, what was happening over here.."

But you can actually see now the deoxygenated blood kind of goes from the right ventricle, through the pulmonary trunk, through the arteries, and into the left and right lung. And once it's there, it's going to kind of mix in with the capillaries. And it's going to start getting oxygen, and then it's going to come out on the other side in the pulmonary veins.."
1,"So you can think of this process as stonification. The first step of lithification is called deposition. This is when sediment is deposited in a new location and it spreads out to form a layer. As more and more layers are created, the layers underneath them become squished together. This is called compaction. When water moves to the layers of sediment, it can carry dissolve minerals with it. The water can leave these minerals in between the sediment particles, which makes everything stick together.."
5,"And it's that our muscle cells are in a syncytium. What does that mean? Well, ""cyte,"" just like we talked about her, just means a cell.

Overall, the renal system is essential for maintaining proper hydration, eliminating toxins, and regulating the body's overall health.."
2,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary.."
7,"One key leadership quality is communication. Effective leaders are able to clearly convey ideas, listen to others, and provide feedback.

Remember, communication is a two-way street, so it's important to listen as much as you speak in order to truly connect with others.."
2,"On its face, those two ideas almost seem like they contradict each other or cancel each other out, but they are two separate threads that each support the overall topic of sharks. They are two distinct ideas here with equal importance. This passage teaches us that A, sharks are deadly, so they are scary, and B, deadly animals must be protected, because they are important. Neither of these ideas are more or less important than one another. They are both main ideas.."

For example, if $100 is invested in a bank account with an annual interest rate of 5% for 3 years, the simple interest earned would be $15. Compound interest, on the other hand, is when interest is calculated on the initial principal amount as well as on the accumulated interest from previous periods."
1,"The low-pressure warmer air at the equator rises into the upper atmosphere where it cools and flows away towards higher latitudes away from the equator. Because the air is now cooler, it starts to sink again and creates a high-pressure band near these latitudes. This process repeats and creates a pattern of high and low-pressure bands from the equator to the poles. We know that air flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. This creates air occurrence or winds.."
