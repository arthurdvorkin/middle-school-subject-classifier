Another type is metaphor, which is a comparison of two unlike things without using ""like"" or ""as"". An example of a metaphor is ""Time is a thief, stealing moments away."" Personification is another type, where non-human things are given human qualities."
4,"I would point to the work of Professor Sonja West at the University of Georgia, who has written extensively on this, and she said the test should be people who are regularly engaged in journalism. That doesn't mean it has to be objective and you can't have a point of view. It doesn't mean there's a problem with FOX News or MSNBC, because they might have a point of view, but it means you're doing something other than electioneering.."
0,"What we wanna do is we wanna take the mean of how much do each of these datapoints deviate from the mean. I know I just used the word mean twice in a sentence, so it might be a little confusing, but as we work through it, hopefully, it'll make a little bit of sense. How much does Manueala's, the number of bubbles she blew, how much does that deviate from the mean? Well, Manueala actually blew four bubbles, and four is the mean. So her deviation, her absolute deviation from the mean is zero. Is zero.."
1,"In turn, the water vapor condenses into tiny liquid water droplets, or, as we see them, clouds. This is called condensation. Air currents then move these clouds all around the Earth. As a cloud collects more and more liquid water droplets, the water may be released from the cloud, pulled down by gravity, and then return to the ocean or land as precipitation, like rain. If it's really cold, though, the water drops may crystallize and become snow.."
2,"I see this as a possible unintended consequence of this proposal, that it hits poor people harder than rich people. As readers, it's not just our responsibility to interpret what the author is saying, we also have to ask ourselves, what are they not saying? In the second argument, the author is arguing that it isn't the government's responsibility to determine how much sugar people consume, and therefore taxes on sugary drinks are unnecessary.."
7,"Effective feedback is an essential aspect of leadership, as it involves providing constructive criticism and praise to help individuals grow and improve. Leaders should aim to deliver feedback in a timely manner, focusing on specific behaviors or actions rather than general traits.

1,"So you might have an intuition that the larger the force, the more acceleration you might see. So let me write it like this. So you might get a sense that if you increase your force, that that's also going to increase your acceleration. And it does turn out that that is indeed the case. Now, the other notion that you might have is that the more of the stuff that there is, the more mass that you have, the harder it is to accelerate it. So if you're mass is larger, than your acceleration is lower.."

If you subtract the specifics, it'll help you think about the structure. And if it helps, you can substitute those specific details about the text with pizza. Is this silly? Yeah, of course. Does it work? I think it does. So is the text structured like a recipe or the history of pizza? If so, it's chronology.."
2," Another important aspect of literary criticism is understanding the author's style, which encompasses their use of language, tone, and structure. By analyzing these elements, critics can gain insight into the author's intentions and the overall impact of the text on the reader. For instance, in the poem ""The Raven"" by Edgar Allan Poe, the author's use of repetition and eerie imagery creates a sense of foreboding and melancholy that enhances the theme of loss and grief."

Being unconventional seems to make Goodall different from other researchers. She hadn't yet been to college which implies that the rest of them had. That doesn't give us a full answer but it does tell us that she's different somehow. So I think unconventional might mean different than what is normal.."
1," Another important law is Newton's second law, which states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass. This means that if you push a heavier object with the same force as a lighter object, the lighter object will accelerate more quickly. The formula for this law is F=ma, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration. This law can be observed in action when a car accelerates faster when the gas pedal is pushed harder."

Nor can O receive from B, nor can A receive from B. But O can give to everyone. Something interesting you'll notice here is, as we just said, O can give to anyone because the O blood type has no As or Bs on it, so no one's going to react to it. For that reason, we call O the universal donor.."
6,"When designing a website, it is important to consider the layout and organization of content. One key principle is to keep the layout simple and easy to navigate, with clear headings and subheadings to guide users.

And then we have this point and this point, if you just found the mean of that point and that point, so halfway between that point and that point, would get you right around there. So the mean of those two points would bring down the mean a little bit. And once again, I'm not figuring out the exact number. But maybe it would be around 53.2, 53.1, or 53.2 seconds. So that's my intuition for the mean of the final round.."

Because the asthenosphere is also pretty solid, the plates rest on top of it. However, the asthenosphere is so hot that it can behave a bit like clay. This means that at convergent boundaries, the edges of the plates can sink into the asthenosphere, a process that is driven by gravity.."

5,"That's right, the blood capillary as well. And that takes us to our last macro molecule, fat. Now, the thing about fat that's rather redonkulous is that because it's got this really nonpolar tail. If it ever shows up next to an enterocyte like this guy, all it has to do is just diffuse across the membrane, and then it ends up on the inside. In the enterocyte, all of our fatty acids are going to be reorganized into what are called chylomicrons, chylomicrons.."
2,"It's important to use context clues when trying to figure out the meaning of a word you don't know. Context clues are hints in the text that help you understand the meaning of unfamiliar words.

The seed then grows into a new plant through the process of germination, where the seed sprouts and starts to grow roots, stems, and leaves."
7,"Servant leadership is a leadership style that prioritizes serving others before oneself. This type of leader focuses on the needs of their team members and helps them develop and perform to their full potential. By placing the needs of others first, servant leaders build strong relationships with their team members and create a positive work environment.  One key concept of servant leadership is empathy, where leaders actively listen to their team members and understand their perspectives and needs."
0,"And we see here, when we look at the ratio, that it was indeed not proportional. So this is not proportional. Now let's look at this one over here. Let's look at what we have here. So I'll look at the ratios. Y over X. So for this first pair, one over one, then we have four over two, well we immediately see that we are not proportional. And then nine over three, it would be three. So clearly this is not a constant number here. We don't always have the same value here, and so this is also not proportional.."

In this video, we're going to talk about the magnetic forces between two magnets. So why do magnet sometimes attract each other and other times repel each other? Well, this has to do with the orientation of the magnets. Orientation is really just a fancy word for how the magnets are positioned compared to one another.."
2,"I did give a pretty obvious title when I said quantitative information in texts. But to those of you who I've misled, I'm sorry. Now, graphs are one of many ways we can make visual representations of data, information you can see, news you can use. And I guess a question that follows from that is why do it? Why make a graph and a chart? What does that have to do with writing? Well, visualizing data can make an argument stronger.."
0,"And then we have 2 plus 4, which is 6, plus another 6 is 12. 4x plus 12 is equal to 136. So to solve for x, a good starting point would be to just to isolate the x terms on one side of the equation or try to get rid of this 12. Well to get rid of that 12, we'd want to subtract 12 from the left-hand side. But we can't just do it from the left-hand side. Then this equality wouldn't hold anymore.."
1,"For example, when a very cold and dry air mass moves over the ocean, it will likely pick up warmth and moisture, transforming it into a slightly warmer and more humid air mass. Weather results from these air masses moving from areas with high air pressure to areas with low air pressure. When this happens, a high- or low-pressure system can form. A high-pressure system has higher pressure at its center than the areas around it, so air moves out from the center.."

So three fatty acid tails that are found here.."
0,"Or you could say 1 and 3/4 of x. So let me make that clear. So y over x is equal to 7/4. Or, we can say that y is always 7/4 of x. We can multiply both sides by x, if we like. So if we multiply both sides by x, we get y is equal to 7/4 times x. And you see it here. When x is 4, 7/4 times 4 is 7. When x is 0, y is 0. When x is 3, 7/4 times 3 is 21 over 4, which is the same thing as 5 and 1/4. So there we go. And let me input it, just to make sure we can input it right. So y is equal to 7/4 x.."

0,"When we multiply our servings by a given amount, we're not multiplying our cost of cake by the same amount. This tells us that this is not proportional. One way to think about proportional relationships, we already said, that the ratio between the variables will be equivalent. Another way to think about it is one variable will always be some constant times the first variable. So in our first example right over here we said the cups of milk is always two times the number of eggs. We can write that down.."

5,"You could say, OK, once it's oxygenated, maybe we're going back to the heart, but it's kind of an arbitrary-- sorry. I spelled artery wrong. These are my flaws. Spelling was never my strong suit. So it's hard to say where the artery ends and the vein begins. A good demarcation is when the carbon dioxide concentration goes low and that the oxygen concentration goes high. That's a good time, where we start from the pulmonary artery.."
0,"Pause the video, if you really think about what I just said, that q is equal to zero, you should be able to do this in less than a second. So why did I say that you could do this in less than a second? Well if you just have a bunch of numbers, and then you multiply them times zero at some point in that, the whole thing is just going to be equal to zero. I could literally have a times b times c times d, I could multiply a bunch of numbers.."

For example, if we have a ratio table for cups of flour to cookies made, we can see that for every 2 cups of flour used, 12 cookies are made. Ratios can be simplified to make them easier to work with."
1,"If you remember, our bodies are made up of multiple complex organ systems that work together to perform all different kinds of functions. Today, let's talk specifically about the nervous system, which is an organ system that allows us to sense and respond to our environment. To begin, the nervous system contains specialized cells and cell parts, called sensory receptors, which are able to pick up signals from the environment. These signals are called stimuli, or stimulus if you're talking about just one.."

3,"Sports biomechanics is the study of the mechanics of movements in sports, focusing on how forces interact within the body to produce motion. One key concept in sports biomechanics is the understanding of leverage and torque, which play a crucial role in generating power and speed in athletic movements. For example, when a basketball player jumps to make a shot, they use the leverage from their leg muscles to propel themselves upward while generating torque to release the ball with accuracy."
1,"This is a primary consumer. This is a primary consumer, as well. Now secondary consumers are by definition things that aren't decomposers, but they're eating primary consumers. So they're going to have arrows coming in from primary consumers and out to either other secondary consumers or to decomposers. So organism three right over here is a secondary consumer. So we're going from a primary consumer to a secondary consumer. So this arrow is from a primary consumer to a secondary consumer.."
1,"All life comes from other life through the process of reproduction. Parents reproduce to form offspring, and during this process, they pass on their genetic information to their offspring. During sexual reproduction, two parents produce offspring. So each offspring gets a mixture of genetic information from two parents. Parents pass this genetic information to their offspring via chromosomes, the coiled up DNA molecules found inside your cells that contain genes.."
5,"Now, we know that that purple dashed line is kind of capturing a certain amount of the air in the atmosphere. And that air is going to have molecules that are bouncing off of each other. Let's say something like this. And you've got a bunch of random collisions happening. And these collisions-- the more frequently the collisions are happening, the higher the pressure in the air. And in fact, measured pressure in the air is around 760 millimeters of mercury. So that's how we think about air pressure.."

1,"So for example, from this parent, you might have gotten the allele here that would describe, let's say, blonde hair, I'll denote that with lowercase b, while from this parent, you might have gotten the allele that's associated with say, brown hair. So they're both associated or they're both coding for the same type of protein that might play a role in hair color but they're different versions of it. So you could view an allele as versions or a version, I'll say, alleles are versions of a gene.."
5,"And then of course we have our bronchiole that feeds into this, and then that might have branched off from another one that feeds into another set of alveolar sacs, but I don't want to get too focused on that.

2,"Doing this, being objective, is very difficult; opinions want to creep in. So what does it mean for a summary to be objective? It means it isn't influenced by feelings or opinions, it's not written in the first person, it's about the text, not me, and it's not a judgment or a review of the information. Let's be clear here; it's not bad to have opinions. In my opinion, it is good to have opinions, but they do not have a place in summaries. You can put opinions to use when you analyze or evaluate something.."
1,"So if there was a bird that was looking for lunch, it'd be very easy to pick off the white moths versus the black moths. And what we saw is actually by the 1900s, most of the peppered moths in London were now darker in color. And so what you had happening generation after generation is variation in the moth color. But as the background environment became darker, the ones that were white colored were easier to pick off by predators.."

And ganglia are these lumps that are attached to nerves and they contain the somas of neurons..
4,"They were always ready to pick up-- probably their tents-- and follow the herd, or follow whatever animals they were hunting, or follow the season, so they could go to warmer climates, maybe, where they're more likely to find something on the ground to eat, maybe, during the winter. Or who knows. So the Paleolithic Era is really distinguished by that. It's a huge swath of time in human history. And it doesn't come to an end until you get to the advent of farming.."
0,"You multiply something times x, divide it by the something, you're just going to be left with an x. So the left-hand side just becomes an x. x is equal to negative 26 divided by negative 13. Well, that's just positive 2, right? A negative divided by a negative is a positive. 26 divided by 13 is 2. And that is our answer. That is our answer. Now let's verify that it really works. That's the fun thing about algebra. You can always make sure that you got the right answer.."

Higher resolution photos have more detail, while lower resolution photos may appear pixelated when enlarged."
4,"So the form estates primary takes as a strong effect on how tight the party control is over that process. The last factor affecting Congressional elections is whether or not they coincide with a presidential election. There's much higher voter turnout for presidential elections since there's a great deal of interest in them and money spent on them, and that means that you tend to get a broader sample of the population.."
2,"The difference between my stomach is gurgling like a tar pit and my stomach is a gurgling tar pit is the difference between simile and metaphor. Simile uses that like or as comparison whereas metaphor just straightforwardly says thing X is thing Y. Love is a rose, my tummy's a tar pit, which was not nearly as successful of a song. Another way to use figurative language is personification, which let's just break that word down. It means to describe something as though it were a person.."
1,"Each bacterium is a single cell that's responsible for taking in nutrients, reproducing, and doing all the things that it needs to stay alive. So an example of a multicellular organism would be you, me, or most any other organism that you can see with the naked eye.

0,"But I like to think in terms of fractions. So 125%, I could rewrite that as 125 over 100. If I divide both the numerator and the denominator by 25, this is equivalent to five over four. So that 170 meters, that is five-fourths of what she could do three years ago. And what you could do three years ago would be four-fourths of what she could do three years ago, because that's 100%. And so to figure out if five-fourths is 170 meters, what is four-fourths? Let us set up a tape diagram right over here.."
